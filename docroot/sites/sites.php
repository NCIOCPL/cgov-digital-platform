/**
 * @file
 * Drupal multi-site configuration file for sites on Acquia Cloud Site Factory.
 *
 * See Drupal's example.sites.php for general information on this file.
 *
 * In short: this file is supposed to populate the $sites variable for use by
 * the caller, with a mapping from domain names to site specific directories.
 * If the requested domain has a site specific directory defined, the caller
 * (likely) includes the settings.php in that specific directory rather than
 * sites/default/settings.php.
 *
 * Acquia Cloud Site Factory has its own storage of per-domain data, which is
 * read by this file to get the needed info. In addition, the global variable
 * $gardens_site_settings is populated with various per-site information, for
 * use by the site specific settings.php file. (See: sites/g/settings.php).
 *
 * If an error occurs or the domain is not found, then we quit processing
 * without setting $sites. The caller then (likely) includes
 * sites/default/acsf.settings.php from sites/default/settings.php, which will
 * emit a "Site not found" response. That response can be customized by
 * modifying sites/default/settings.php.
 *
 * (At least Acquia's standard) Drush aliases are *not supported* for usage
 * with Acquia Cloud Site Factory. Drush9 commands simply don't work with them.
 */

// Protect against sites.php being included from the wrong docroot, on Acquia
// servers containing multiple (staging) environments for a customer. This is
// a known issue only in previous versions of the module which worked with
// Drush7/8 + Acquia's aliases, but it seems prudent to do this check anyway.
// Notes:
// - The environment values are always defined on Acquia hardware. If they are
//   not defined, we cannot assume anything about the file system structure so
//   we skip this check.
// - realpath() includes AH_SITE_NAME; we instead want to match
//   AH_SITE_GROUP.AH_SITE_ENVIRONMENT (which is always a symlink)
//   - to accommodate for possible future changes or botched provisioning;
//   - because Site Factory doesn't use AH_SITE_NAME anywhere else;
//   - because AH_SITE_NAME may not be correct in some cases, e.g. when our
//     post-db-copy/000-acquia_required_scrub.php hook executes acsf-site-scrub.
