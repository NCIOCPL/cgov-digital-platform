  ## App module builders below.
  ## The constructor of the lookup service takes in the file path
  ## of the zipcode DB, So we cannot use the constructor, we must
  ## use a factory method, which is what factory below does. This
  ## method does NOT have any arguments. So there is a create
  ## method, but our class does not have to implement the
  ## ContainerInjectionInterface nor the ContainerFactoryPluginInterface.
  cgov_cts.zip_code_lookup:
    class: Drupal\cgov_cts\FileBasedZipCodeLookupService
    factory: Drupal\cgov_cts\FileBasedZipCodeLookupService::create
