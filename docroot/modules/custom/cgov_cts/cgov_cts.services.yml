  ## The constructor of the lookup service takes in the file path
  ## of the zipcode DB, So we cannot use the constructor, we must
  ## use a factory method, which is what factory below does. This
  ## method does NOT have any arguments. So there is a create
  ## method, but our class does not have to implement the
  ## ContainerInjectionInterface nor the ContainerFactoryPluginInterface.
