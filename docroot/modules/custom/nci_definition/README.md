In this directory, run `npm ci` to set up the necessary assets. The
initial run of install may take a few minutes, but subsequent builds will be
faster.
After installing dependencies, plugins can be built with `npm run build` or `npm run watch`.

Before commiting js/build/glossifier.js you should do a final `npm run build` and commit the built code.
