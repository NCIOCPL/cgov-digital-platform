# Folder Info

## What goes here?

Some code is not generic enough or not small enough to be connsidered a helper function. This code is what we alternately call a library, feature, enhancement, or module. Some features will be single files, some will have attendant stylesheets, some will forever be of the 'dear god, this code makes no sense and I swear I will rewrite it from scratch (but in reality it never happens)' persuasion. It all goes here.

### Why didn't we call it 'Modules' again, like the old site?

Dear god man, how many modules folders can a person truly bear in a single repo before he snaps and drops all his tables??
