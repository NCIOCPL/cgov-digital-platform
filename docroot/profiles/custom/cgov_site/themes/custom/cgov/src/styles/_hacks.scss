// Hack to change spacing for thumbnail cards on Cancer Topic pages. They should have the styling of 3/9 columns instead of 2/10. Modifying widths of 2/10 for this specific instance. When the html is changed to 3/9, this hack can come out.
@include bp(medium-up) {
	.cgvtopicpage .card-thumbnail .small-2 {
		width: 25%;
	}
	.cgvtopicpage .card-thumbnail .small-10 {
		width: 75%;
	}
}



// Hack to take away padding from Blog pages when in mobile. When the new classes are added, small-3, small-9, this should not be necessary anymore.
@include bp(small) {
	.medium-9 .post-info {
		padding-left: 0;
		padding-right: 0;

// Hotfix for OCEPROJECT-3933. The button min-width of 130px doesn't work in this instance because the container its in can be smaller than that.
// Applies to /publications/dictionaries/cancer-drug.
// HTML needs to be changed for this widget
.dictionary-search .button {
	min-width: inherit;
}

// This is a hack to rehide the comment policy on pages that aren't blog post pages with comments.
// The redundant rule is being left in the blog partial until a final approach is determined (some
// backend issues may need to be resolved). If you find this comment unchanged in 6 months, just
// sigh, shake your head, and remove the redundant rule. BB 4/2018.

// NOTE: The comment below about all.js is out of date and possibly predates the encapsulation of the
// page specific templates. This feature now only works on BlogPostPages
.blog-comment-policy {
	display: none;
	// made visible by JavaScript if an element matching `#cgvCommentsSl` exists (i.e., if comments are enabled)
	// @see all.js
