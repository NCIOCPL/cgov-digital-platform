## What goes here?

Useful helper functions that are generic enough to be shared across multiple custom libraries and/or entry points.

### But what about helper functions only used in one theme's entry points?

Well, if the code is generic enough to be considered a utility and does not have an associated library, than it should be here even if its use is currently scoped to onnly one theme. Requirements may change and having a single store of all of our custom utility functions will make it easier for future work.
