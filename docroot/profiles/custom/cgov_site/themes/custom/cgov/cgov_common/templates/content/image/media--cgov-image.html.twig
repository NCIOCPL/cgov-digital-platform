{#
  This template is here just for documentation.

  This should only be used for the Crop: Display Modes.
  The back-end will choose between:
    * the override image (field_override_img_XXX)
    * the cropped image (field_media_image)
  It will remove the image that is not used. It will also remove both
    if they have no image or crop.
  You should leave this template as just content as it should only
    ever have a single image field.
  Obviously if you are making a different display that is not a crop
    you **SHOULD** create an appropriate twig template.
