 * Delighter configuration rules.
 *
 * A rule is an object required to have a rule and delighter property. The third property exclude is optional. Exclude is an array of regular expressions and/or
 * objects containing a rule (regex) and whitelist (array) property.
 *
 * NOTE: The function that tests rules is lazy and will only return the first match, so make sure a previous rule doesn't conflict with yours if it's not working.
