## What goes here?

Sometimes libraries need to have access to theme specific assets like sprite sheets (and by extension are scoped to only one theme's entry points).

For example, beacause pageOptions is a library that is only used in the Common.js entry point and because it is dependent on the cgov_common sprite sheet it goes here instead of in Core/libraries.
