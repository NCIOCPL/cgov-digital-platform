## What is this?
This folder is a parallel of cgov/src/styles for when we need to replace elements that would normally be in `~Core/styles/*`. The process for these should be something like:
1. Take a copy from the original location
2. Delete un-needed elements
3. Document what elements are staying and why. AT A MINIMUM ADD A URL OF WHERE IT WAS USED.
4. If it makes sense, break up the file into smaller partials that could be removed as we update cgdp "components" with NCIDS components.
