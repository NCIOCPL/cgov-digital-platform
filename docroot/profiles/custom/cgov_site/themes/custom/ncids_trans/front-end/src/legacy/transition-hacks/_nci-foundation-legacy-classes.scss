/**************************************************************************
 * What am I?
 * I am a big ol hack. We had been generating default HTML stylings using
 * the _types partial and the $include-html-type-classes variable being
 * true. But we moved foundation outside of the legacy definition to save
 * kilobytes. We need *some* of the styles though. TBH, a lot of the
 * original will be removed from here. For example, we probably just want
 * to set the default link style using NCIDS, so we could remove that.
 * Heading tags are a problem as we want our own. So that is another thing
 * that will probably be removed. So know that the foundation _types
 * partial was what this started as, but we will be hacking as we go.
 * Someday, maybe soon, this will not be needed anymore and just replaced
 * with elements from usa-prose, or other NCIDS partials.
 *
 * Adding to the above, we need variables, we can't just add some of these
 * things on their own.
