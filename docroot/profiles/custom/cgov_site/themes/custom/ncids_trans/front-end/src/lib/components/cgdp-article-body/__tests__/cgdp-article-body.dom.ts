		<h2 id="denial" class="">Denial</h2>
		<p>When you were first diagnosed, you may have had trouble believing or accepting the fact that you have cancer. This is called denial. It can be helpful because it can give you time to adjust to your diagnosis. It can also give you time to feel hopeful and better about the future.</p>
		<p>Sometimes, denial is a serious problem. If it lasts too long, it can keep you from getting the treatment you need.</p>
		<p>The good news is that most people work through denial. Usually by the time treatment begins, most people accept the fact that they have cancer and move forward. This is true for those with cancer as well as the people they love and care about.</p>

		<h2 id="anger" class="">Anger</h2>
		<p>It's very normal to ask, "Why me?" and be angry at the cancer. You may also feel anger or resentment towards your health care providers, your healthy friends and your loved ones. &nbsp;And if you're religious, you may even feel angry with God.</p>
		<p>Anger often comes from feelings that are hard to show. Common examples are:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>fear</li>
			<li>panic</li>
			<li>frustration</li>
			<li>anxiety</li>
			<li>helplessness</li>
		</ul>
		<p>If you feel angry, you don't have to pretend that everything is okay. It's not healthy to keep it inside you. Talk with your family and friends about your anger. Or, ask your doctor to refer you to a counselor. And know that anger can be helpful in that it may motivate you to take action.&nbsp;</p>

		<h2 id="fear-and-worry" class="">Fear and Worry</h2>
		<p>It's scary to hear that you have cancer. You may be afraid or worried about:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Being in pain, either from the cancer or the treatment</li>
			<li>Feeling sick or looking different as a result of your treatment</li>
			<li>Taking care of your family</li>
			<li>Paying your bills</li>
			<li>Keeping your job</li>
			<li>Dying</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Some fears about cancer are based on stories, rumors, or wrong information. To cope with fears and worries, it often helps to be informed. Most people feel better when they learn the facts. They feel less afraid and know what to expect. Learn about your cancer and understand what you can do to be an active partner in your care. Some studies even suggest that people who are well-informed about their illness and treatment are more likely to follow their treatment plans and recover from cancer more quickly than those who are not.</p>

		<h2 id="hope" class="">Hope</h2>
		<p>[EMBEDDED IMAGE (woman-praying-article.jpg) PLACEHOLDER]</p>
		<p>Once people accept that they have cancer, they often feel a sense of hope. There are many reasons to feel hopeful. Millions of people who have had cancer are alive today. Your chances of living with cancer—and living beyond it—are better now than they have ever been before. And people with cancer can lead active lives, even during treatment.</p>
		<p>Some doctors think that hope may help your body deal with cancer. So, scientists are studying whether a hopeful outlook and positive attitude helps people feel better. Here are some ways you can build your sense of hope:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Plan your days as you've always done.</li>
			<li>Don't limit the things you like to do just because you have cancer.</li>
			<li>Look for reasons to have hope. If it helps, write them down or talk to others about them.</li>
			<li>Spend time in nature.</li>
			<li>Reflect on your religious or spiritual beliefs.</li>
			<li>Listen to stories about people with cancer who are leading active lives.</li>
