            restaging to evaluate the extent of disease is indicated. Cytologic or histologic
            documentation of recurrent disease is obtained whenever
            possible.  When therapy is selected, the estrogen-receptor (ER) status, progesterone-receptor (PR) status, and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2/neu) status at the time of recurrence and previous treatment are
            considered, if known.  </p><p id="_1444" tabindex="-1">ER status may change at the time
            of recurrence.  In a single small study by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (MDA-MBDT-8081), 36% of hormone receptor&#x2013;positive
            tumors were found to be receptor negative in biopsy specimens isolated at the
            time of recurrence.<a href="#cit/section_6.6">6</a>  Patients in this study had no interval treatment.  If
            ER and PR statuses are unknown, then the site(s) of recurrence, disease-free
            interval, response to previous treatment, and menopausal status are useful in
            the selection of chemotherapy or hormone therapy.<a href="#cit/section_6.7">7</a></p><p id="_1445" tabindex="-1">Treatment options for locoregional recurrent breast cancer include the following:</p><div class="pdq-content-list"><ol id="_1446"><li>Chemotherapy.</li><li>Hormone therapy.</li><li>Radiation therapy.</li><li>Surgery.</li><li>Targeted therapy (e.g., trastuzumab).</li></ol></div><p id="_1447" tabindex="-1">Patients with locoregional

DCIS can progress to invasive cancer, but estimates of the probability of this vary widely.  Some reports include DCIS in breast cancer statistics.  In 2015, DCIS is expected to account for about 16% of all newly diagnosed invasive plus noninvasive breast tumors in the United States.<a href="#cit/section_8.1">1</a> For invasive and noninvasive tumors detected by screening, DCIS accounts for approximately 25% of all cases.</p><p id="_1572" tabindex="-1">The frequency of a DCIS diagnosis has increased markedly in the United States since the use of screening mammography became widespread.  Very few cases of DCIS present as a palpable mass,
            with more than 90% being diagnosed by mammography alone.<a href="#cit/section_8.2">2</a></p><p id="_1573" tabindex="-1">DCIS comprises a heterogeneous
            group of histopathologic lesions that have been classified into the following
            subtypes primarily because of architectural pattern:</p><div class="pdq-content-list"><ul id="_1574"><li>Micropapillary.</li><li>Papillary.</li><li>Solid.</li><li>Cribriform.</li><li>Comedo.</li></ul></div><p id="_1575" tabindex="-1">Comedo-type DCIS consists of cells that appear
            cytologically malignant, with the presence of high-grade nuclei,
            pleomorphism, and abundant central luminal necrosis.  Comedo-type DCIS appears
            to be more aggressive, with a higher probability of associated invasive ductal
            carcinoma.<a href="#cit/section_8.3">3</a></p></section><section id="_1576"><h3 id="_1576_toc">Treatment Options for Patients With DCIS</h3><p id="_1578" tabindex="-1">Treatment options for DCIS include the following:</p><div class="pdq-content-list"><ol id="_1579"><li> Breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy plus radiation therapy with or without tamoxifen.</li><li>Total mastectomy with or without tamoxifen.
            </li></ol></div><p id="_1580" tabindex="-1">In the past, the customary treatment for DCIS was mastectomy.<a href="#cit/section_8.4">4</a>  The
            rationale for mastectomy included a 30% incidence of multicentric disease, a
            40% prevalence of residual tumor at mastectomy after wide excision alone,
            and a 25% to 50% incidence of in-breast recurrence after limited surgery for
            palpable tumor, with 50% of those recurrences being invasive carcinoma.<a href="#cit/section_8.4">4</a><a href="#cit/section_8.5">5</a>
            The combined local and distant recurrence rate after mastectomy is 1% to
            2%.
            No randomized comparisons of mastectomy versus breast-conserving surgery plus breast radiation therapy are available.</p><p id="_1581" tabindex="-1">Because breast-conserving surgery combined with breast radiation therapy is successful for invasive carcinoma, this conservative approach was extended to DCIS.  To determine whether breast-conserving surgery plus radiation therapy was a reasonable approach to the management of DCIS, the National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP) and the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) have each completed prospective randomized trials in which women with localized DCIS and negative surgical margins after excisional biopsy were randomly assigned to receive either breast radiation therapy (50 Gy) or no further therapy.<a href="#cit/section_8.6">6</a><a href="#cit/section_8.7">7</a><a href="#cit/section_8.8">8</a><a href="#cit/section_8.9">9</a>

            However, early-stage disease accounts for only 10% to 20% of all cases
            diagnosed in the United States.  The remaining patients present with metastatic
            disease in either regional or distant sites.  The overall survival rate in
            these patients at 5 years ranges from almost no survival for patients with
            disseminated disease to almost 50% survival for patients with localized distal
            gastric cancers confined to resectable regional disease.  Even with apparent
            localized disease, the 5-year survival rate of patients with proximal gastric
            cancer is only 10% to 15%.  Although the treatment of patients with
            disseminated gastric cancer may result in palliation of symptoms and some
            prolongation of survival, long remissions are uncommon.

            <div id="_section_49" class="pdq-sections"><p id="_51" tabindex="-1">Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is an uncommon tumor. Most clinical management recommendations in the literature are based on case series that describe a relatively small number of patients who were not entered on formal clinical trials, evaluated with uniform clinical staging procedures, treated with uniform treatment protocols, or provided with regular, prescribed follow-up. These reports are also confounded by potential selection bias, referral bias, and short follow-up; and they are underpowered to detect modest differences in outcome. </p><p id="_206" tabindex="-1">In addition, outcomes of patients with American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I and stage II disease are often reported together. In the absence of results from clinical trials with prescribed work-up, treatments, and follow-up, most MCC patients have been treated using institutional or practitioner preferences that consider the specifics of each case as well as patient preference.</p><p id="_207" tabindex="-1">Two competing philosophies underlie many of the controversies about the most appropriate method of treating MCC.  In the first philosophy, MCC is treated like other nonmelanoma skin cancers, with an emphasis on treating local-regional disease with surgery and radiation as appropriate.  In the second philosophy, MCC is treated according to its <em>biologic features</em>.  This approach makes it analogous to small cell lung cancer, which is assumed to be a systemic disease, and leads to a more routine recommendation of systematic adjuvant chemotherapy.<a href="#cit/section_4.1">1</a></p><section id="_52"><h3 id="_52_toc">Surgery for the Primary Lesion</h3><p id="_53" tabindex="-1">In a review of 18 case series, 279 of 926 patients (30.1%) developed local recurrence during follow-up, excluding those presenting with distant metastatic disease at presentation. These recurrences have been typically attributed to inadequate surgical margins or possibly a lack of adjuvant radiation therapy.<a href="#cit/section_4.2">2</a><a href="#cit/section_4.3">3</a>
            </p><p id="_182" tabindex="-1">Given the propensity of MCC to recur locally (sometimes with satellite lesions and/or in-transit metastases), wide local excision to reduce the risk of local recurrence has been recommended for patients with clinical stage I or stage II disease. </p><p id="_183" tabindex="-1">Recommendations about the optimal minimum width and depth of normal tissue margin to be excised around the primary tumor differ among the various retrospective case series, but this question has not been studied systematically.<a href="#cit/section_4.3">3</a><a href="#cit/section_4.4">4</a><a href="#cit/section_4.5">5</a><a href="#cit/section_4.6">6</a><a href="#cit/section_4.7">7</a>[<a href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335158&amp;version=HealthProfessional&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000335158&amp;version=HealthProfessional&amp;language=English'); return(false);">Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii</a>] No definitive data suggest that extremely wide margins improve overall survival (OS), although some reports suggest that wider margins appear to improve local control.<a href="#cit/section_4.3">3</a>[<a href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=335158&amp;version=HealthProfessional&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000335158&amp;version=HealthProfessional&amp;language=English'); return(false);">Level of evidence: 3iiiDiii</a>] Frozen-section evaluation of margins may be useful, especially when the tumor is in an anatomical site that is not amenable to wide margins.

            <div id="_section_83" class="pdq-sections"><p id="_84" tabindex="-1">El carcinoma de c&#xE9;lulas de Merkel (CCM) es un tumor poco com&#xFA;n.   La mayor&#xED;a de las recomendaciones cl&#xED;nicas para su tratamiento que se encuentran en la bibliograf&#xED;a se basan en series de casos que describen un n&#xFA;mero relativamente reducido de pacientes que no participaron en ensayos cl&#xED;nicos formales, no se evaluaron con procedimientos de estadificaci&#xF3;n cl&#xED;nica uniformes, no se trataron con protocolos de tratamiento uniformes ni se les recomend&#xF3; un seguimiento regular. Estos informes tambi&#xE9;n tienen posibles factores de confusi&#xF3;n debidos a posibles sesgos de selecci&#xF3;n y  verificaci&#xF3;n, as&#xED; como un seguimiento breve; tampoco tienen la potencia para detectar diferencias moderadas en el desenlace.</p><p id="_85" tabindex="-1">Adem&#xE1;s, los desenlaces de pacientes con enfermedad en estadio I y estadio II seg&#xFA;n el American Joint Committee on Cancer a menudo se notifican juntos.   A falta de resultados de ensayos cl&#xED;nicos con ex&#xE1;menes, tratamientos y seguimiento prescritos, la mayor&#xED;a de los pacientes de CCM se trataron usando preferencias de instituciones o profesionales que consideran los elementos espec&#xED;ficos de cada caso, as&#xED; como las preferencias de los pacientes.</p><p id="_86" tabindex="-1">Hay dos filosof&#xED;as divergentes que sirven de base para muchas de las pol&#xE9;micas acerca del m&#xE9;todo m&#xE1;s apropiado para tratar un CCM.
