        <p>The Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry Course is offered&nbsp;periodically by the Radiation Epidemiology Branch of the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). This course is intended for people who are interested in learning about the health effects of radiation exposure (environmental, occupational, and medical) in relation to both cancer and non-cancer outcomes. The course will cover methodological tools used in radiation epidemiology; epidemiologic, statistical and dosimetric concepts; as well as key studies and new developments in the field.</p>

        <h4>WHAT IS THE KRISPY KREME CHALLENGE?</h4>
        <p>2400 calories, 12 doughnuts, 5 miles, 1 hour.  The mantra of the Krispy Kreme Challenge epitomizes the test of physical fitness and gastrointestinal fortitude.  What started as a challenge among ten friends has transformed into a nationally publicized charity race, and the number one tradition to complete before graduating from North Carolina State University.</p>
        <p>On February 3rd, 2018, we hosted 5,516 people for the 14th annual Krispy Kreme Challenge, where we donated $170,000 to the UNC Children's Hospital, bringing the cumulative donation to over an impressive $1.5 million. We are now UNC Children’s Hospital’s largest unrestricted donor.</p>
        <p>Participants begin the Challenge at the Memorial Belltower on the campus of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. Runners then travel 2.5 miles through historic downtown Raleigh to the Krispy Kreme located at the intersection of Peace and Person Streets, where they attempt to consume one dozen original glazed doughnuts. The hardest part of the Challenge awaits them as they run 2.5 miles back to the Memorial Belltower.</p>
        <p>This is the Krispy Kreme Challenge.</p>
        <h4>Get Involved!</h4>
        <p>The Krispy Kreme Challenge has a spot for everyone. From runners to volunteers, find the level of involvement that is right for you.</p>
