          The Chromatin and Cell Fate Decisions in Development, Aging & Cancer symposium, hosted by the Center of Excellence in Chromosome Biology (CECB), offers an opportunity to learn more about the current status of chromosome structure and function in development and disease, share research and discuss the use and implications of these advances for clinical applications. The mission of CECB is to achieve a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms involved in chromosome function, how aberrations in chromosomes and chromatin lead to disease and how these defects can be corrected. Towards achieving our mission, this symposium brings together scientists in the fields of chromatin and chromosome biology, with the focus on stem cells, cell development, aging and cancer. Registration deadline is October 31, 2019.

        <p>The Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry Course is offered&nbsp;periodically by the Radiation Epidemiology Branch of the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). This course is intended for people who are interested in learning about the health effects of radiation exposure (environmental, occupational, and medical) in relation to both cancer and non-cancer outcomes. The course will cover methodological tools used in radiation epidemiology; epidemiologic, statistical and dosimetric concepts; as well as key studies and new developments in the field.</p>

        <h4>WHAT IS THE KRISPY KREME CHALLENGE?</h4>
        <p>2400 calories, 12 doughnuts, 5 miles, 1 hour.  The mantra of the Krispy Kreme Challenge epitomizes the test of physical fitness and gastrointestinal fortitude.  What started as a challenge among ten friends has transformed into a nationally publicized charity race, and the number one tradition to complete before graduating from North Carolina State University.</p>
        <p>On February 3rd, 2018, we hosted 5,516 people for the 14th annual Krispy Kreme Challenge, where we donated $170,000 to the UNC Children's Hospital, bringing the cumulative donation to over an impressive $1.5 million. We are now UNC Children’s Hospital’s largest unrestricted donor.</p>
        <p>Participants begin the Challenge at the Memorial Belltower on the campus of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, NC. Runners then travel 2.5 miles through historic downtown Raleigh to the Krispy Kreme located at the intersection of Peace and Person Streets, where they attempt to consume one dozen original glazed doughnuts. The hardest part of the Challenge awaits them as they run 2.5 miles back to the Memorial Belltower.</p>
        <p>This is the Krispy Kreme Challenge.</p>
        <h4>Get Involved!</h4>
        <p>The Krispy Kreme Challenge has a spot for everyone. From runners to volunteers, find the level of involvement that is right for you.</p>

        <p><strong>Speaker</strong>: <a href="/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/schiffman-mark" title="">Mark Schiffman, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, senior investigator in the Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology &amp; Genetics</p>
        <p><strong>Description</strong>: Dr. Schiffman plans and conducts long-term molecular epidemiologic studies of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer, taking what he learned from years of studying HPV&nbsp;natural history and etiology studies and applying it to the development of prevention methods&nbsp;and clinical management.</p>
        <p><strong>Background:</strong>&nbsp;The Robert S. Gordon, Jr. Lecture was established in 1995 in tribute to Dr. Gordon for his outstanding contributions to the field of epidemiology and for his distinguished service to the National Institutes of Health.
