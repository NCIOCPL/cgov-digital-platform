        <p><strong>Can you give us an overview of the application of immunology to cancer, the history and where we are in 2018?</strong></p>
        <p>Sure. Cancer immunotherapy is really the result of 30 to 40 years of basic immunology science. In the 1980s we had T cells being identified and the ability to identify cytokines, that was a major area of progress that went on into the 1990s.&nbsp; Viral diseases became an area of high inquiry during the 90s, and we were learning a lot about T cell recognition of viruses and how an antigen is processed and presented to a T cell.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/steinman-facts.html">Ralph Steinman</a> was working on dendritic cells, which at first we thought were activating T cells but later realized they were regulating them. Then in the 1990s people like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10209159">Jim Allison</a> and Liepin<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15970540">g Chen</a> were identifying regulatory signals on T cells, realizing that T cells are regulated by a number of different signals, CTLA4 and B7 1 and 2, and now we recognize that there are a panel of important T cell regulatory checkpoints. I think the early ones were real efforts in science to try to isolate and sequence, but with the development of technologies that were able to sequence the human genome, those were also applied to immunology.&nbsp; So during the early 2000s we were isolating all of the different checkpoint-activating and down-regulating signals on the T cell that interact with dendritic cells and in some cases tumors. That really allowed us to develop these antibodies that can alter the function of T cells through these signals. And in 2011 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipilimumab">anti-CTLA4</a> was the first to be approved and we've had now over 30 FDA approvals for multiple indications in different cancers.&nbsp; We would have expected melanoma being the first but what we weren't expecting was lung cancer and cancers such as head and neck and bladder and some of the others that were just not even on our radar to respond to immunotherapies.&nbsp; We were shocked.</p>
        <p><strong>A cancer that was full of hundreds or thousands of mutations was the worst news of all, wasn't it?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes! And suddenly we took patients who were resistant to chemotherapy, with metastatic disease going home to hospice, and turned them around to where they're living normal lives.&nbsp; About <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028255">65 - 70% who got this treatment responded</a>. That's remarkable.&nbsp; So I hope that patients today can at least feel there is more hope than there was even ten years ago. And going on an early phase trial today is very different from going on an early phase trial even ten years ago.</p>
        <p><strong>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658856">combination</a> of pembrolizumab and chemo is widely used now. The chemo is killing cancer cells but it is also making their antigens more accessible, or educating T-cells, is that correct?</strong></p>
        <p>We don't really know the full mechanism.&nbsp; The hypothesis is that the chemotherapy does a couple of things, it reduces the tumor burden quickly, because when you have a large tumor burden, immunotherapy can take a couple of months to see a response.&nbsp; So that's one thing.&nbsp; The other thing that chemotherapy will do is, as you said,&nbsp; we believe it releases antigens, similar to how we think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncolytic_virus">oncolytic viruses</a> work. Chemotherapy may also be releasing toxins, cytokines and chemokines,&nbsp; which bring in inflammatory cells to clean up the tumor damage, and these inflammatory cells may in turn present antigens to the T cells. So we think that's how it works but to be honest with you, there isn't great data.&nbsp; What I can tell you is that preclinically there is data for the different chemotherapy agents, and they all have different effects on the immune system.&nbsp; For instance, we've&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20346445">published</a> on the taxols and they enhance the antigen-processing machinery in dendritic cells.&nbsp; They're specific for dendritic cells, and probably for a specific population of dendritic cells.&nbsp; And cyclophosphamide and gemcitibine reduce the suppressive cells, the myeloid-derived suppressor cells in mouse models. There may be many mechanisms, and there are not a lot of studies yet, particularly in humans, showing specifically how chemotherapies affect the immune system. We've always thought, you give chemotherapy and it kills cancers, it stops cells that are proliferating, but we now know they have a lot of effects, and I think it's a whole area that we need to investigate more. I suspect that looking at different dosing, looking at different sequencing, of these agents and what they're targeting would be very helpful for figuring out how to combine these with the newer agents that are being developed and approved as therapies, whether they're immunotherapies or targeted therapies.</p>
        <p><strong>If I were a cancer patient and not scientifically sophisticated, how would I find the best care, or a good clinical trial?</strong></p>
        <p>Very important question.&nbsp; I was one of the co-chairs of the Blue Ribbon Panel and worked on the Moon Shot and continue to work with the Biden Initiative, and one area that the Moonshot under Vice President Biden's leadership was to try to bring all the communities together to have an easy access for patients, to help them figure out what the clinical trials were, and even be able to access clinical trials based on their genetic information and other information. That's a work in progress, there are some pilots studies for that, but in the meantime, it's very hard with the lists [of clinical trials] that are available in different places. If you have a cancer that has a foundation, they can tell you what priority clinical trials are available, and I always encourage people to contact these foundations. The American Association for Cancer Research will also be helpful in connecting patients to the right places.&nbsp; Having a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in your area, I would always look there, they always have lists and those are going to be the most scientifically rational studies.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Congratulations on your election as the president of AACR.</strong></p>
        <p>Thank you. It's an opportunity to really help in ways that I could not help before, so this really cool.</p>
        <p><strong>I have read that cardiotoxicity is an issue, with both chemotherapy and also with targeted therapies.</strong></p>
        <p>That's something we want to prevent in the future. We don't want to overtreat, and we don't want to give the wrong treatments if you're predisposed.&nbsp; As treatments become more diverse we need to do more understand their long-term consequences.</p>

        <p><strong><u>Hartley</u>:</strong> The contraption on the <span><a href="https://www.cell.com/cancer-cell/issue?pii=S1535-6108(17)X0011-1">cover of Cancer Cell</a></span> that contained <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30300582">your article</a>&nbsp;</span>refers to some of your findings, correct?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Klijn</u>:</strong> The concept for the cover was created by Allison Bruce who’s a graphics illustrator, we have extensive experience with her and she’s great. She thought of the RAS pathway that we were examining as a Rube Goldberg machine, and she has captured the basic function of the RAS pathway and the feedback mechanism that we and many others have described by having RAS and RAF be a series of gutters and the gray lines represent the paths of the balls without inhibitors. The balls from the RAS and RAF gutters fall down onto the MEK trampoline, and then bounce into the ERK receptacle, where they are deposited into a bucket that then raises the RAS gutter so the balls stop flowing. One of the points of the paper is that MEK inhibition alone, represented by the bat, is not sufficient to stop the pathway, since when you introduce the bat into the system you hit the balls but they bounce back on the wall back up to the RAS gutter and basically keep the signal flowing. Experimentally we see this as an increase in phospho-MEK and RAS-GTP in the presence of a MEK inhibitor. And the introduction of the RAF inhibitor, which is in this case the mitt, makes sure that the balls that get hit out of the system by MEK inhibitor are taken completely out, by depositing them into the funnel down below. So the presence of both MEK and RAF inhibitors basically causes the system to be completely blocked off.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Malek</u>:</strong> Allison did a really great job, because the Rube Goldberg at its heart is a system that you build that does something very simple using a very over-complicated process. And I thought that was kind of central to this, because the MAP kinase pathway is meant to do something very simple, regulate cell growth, regulate cell proliferation. But it is highly complicated, it’s convoluted which is what this Rube Goldberg illustrates, and to interrogate this pathway with small molecule inhibitors or think of therapeutically approaching this pathway, I think we have to consider the complexity of the signaling when we’re thinking about it.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley:</u></strong>&nbsp;Is it your view that the increase in BRAF-CRAF dimers that is driven by [the MEK inhibitor] cobimetinib is driven only by increased RAS-GTP?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Malek</u>:</strong> We are obviously actively working on understanding kinase-independent functions of CRAF. Mariano Barbacid’s <span><a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29395869">paper</a>&nbsp;</span>that was published earlier this year really showed nicely that in the KRAS-driven GEMMs model in an intervention setting that CRAF depletion inhibited tumor growth. And it’s nicely supported, the earlier papers from Dave Tuveson and Mariano in a tumor initiation context. What we think is going on is, we think that in the presence of MEK inhibition it’s really RAF kinase dependence that is the pathway driver, which is why you see the synergistic activity with RAF kinase inhibitors. The kinase-independent function of RAF appears to be, at least in our early data, MEK independent, and we’re now trying to understand exactly what the molecular mechanism of that is. And there may be context dependence again in places where you might see RAF kinase independent functions vs kinase dependent functions.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Klijn</u>:</strong> I think also this is a way to explain why single agent RAF inhibition isn’t as effective as you might have expected if everything would have been kinase dependent in that context. I think that one thing that we also tried to say here is that, depending on which of the RASs are mutated, there might be a differential dependency on the kinase function of CRAF, without any other inhibition. I think MEK really drives the dependence on RAF kinase function, but in other contexts those dependencies might fluctuate depending on which RAS is mutated or what the cell context is.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Malek</u>:</strong> That’s an excellent point, because I think, that’s kind of how we started the paper, where we did this broad cell line profiling with the RAF kinase inhibitors, across hundreds of cell lines, Figure 1 of the paper, Figure 1b, and looked at BRAF-mutant, KRAS-mutant, NRAS-mutant, and wild-type cells. And clearly the RAF inhibitors are quite effective in the V600E cell lines but they were not effective in the majority of KRAS-mutant lines. From there our thinking was, either these cell lines simply don’t care about RAF kinase activity, because we’re dosing the drugs up and we’re just not seeing much of an effect, or maybe our RAF kinase inhibitor is not sufficiently potent and it could be a pharmacology thing. But we know that kinase inhibitor is actually active enough to work in the BRAF V600E setting. In fact if you look at Figure 1b you can see that the RAF inhibitors, the RAF dimer inhibitors anyway, type II, work quite well in NRAS mutant lines. So we think there is a context dependency where there will be subsets of RAS mutants that are going to be more dependent on RAF kinase activity, and there will be others that won’t. And the NRAS data, we didn’t extensively go into them in this paper, but we have data with multiple RAF dimer inhibitors showing greater single agent activity in NRAS-mutant tumors that looks almost equivalent in potency to what we see in the context of BRAF V600E. So we think probably RAF dimers are more active, perhaps it’s because the NRAS mutant lines harbor the Q61 mutation which we know is a more dominant mutation, so perhaps it’s about elevated RAS-GTP levels in that context. I’m actually going to talk about this at the <span><a href="https://www.aacr.org/Meetings/Pages/MeetingDetail.aspx?EventItemID=165#.WlPdgEtG2Ho">AACR RAS meeting</a> </span>in December and get into this concept a little bit more.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley:</u></strong>&nbsp;I was struck by the fact that in your screen of several hundred cell lines you found synergy between your type II RAF inhibitor and your MEK inhibitor in some cell lines and not in other cell lines, and that was sometimes independent of KRAS status.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Klijn:</u></strong>&nbsp;Broadly the synergy tracks with RAS mutation status, that’s Figure 4 I believe, Figure 4A, there’s clear and statistically significant enrichment of synergy in the RAS mutant context. So broadly, it tracks with RAS mutations. But there’s still a spread within that group, there are RAS mutants that show less synergy than others and similarly in the wild type situation you can see that there are RAS and BRAF wild type lines that show synergy but are not mutant for those genes. So it’s not a cut and dried, black and white difference, but the enrichment in RAS mutation group is very clear and significant. What I think we say in 4F and G and also the quantification in H is that the synergy is clearly seen in those lines whether mutant or not if they’re able to increase phosphoMEK after MEK inhibition.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley</u>:</strong> Is this combination therapy clinic worthy, is it phase I worthy?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Malek</u>:</strong> I think so, we currently have a <span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03284502">phase I trial</a>&nbsp;</span>ongoing with a company called Hanmi, they have a RAF inhibitor that we are partnering with them on, we’re combining with cobimetinib. <span><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02974725">Novartis</a>&nbsp;</span>is also pursuing this combination, they’re combining both with trametinib, and they’re also running a combination with their ERK inhibitor in development. The key to this again is, can you achieve a therapeutic index with this combination.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley</u>:</strong> Are you stratifying patients?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Malek</u>:</strong> Yes, obviously the RAS mutant patients we would expect would be enriched for responses and certainly the KRAS G13Ds in colon might be a place that we would be really interested in testing this combination. And I think the synergy hypothesis leads us to believe that you could dose down the MEK inhibitor and re-wire the pathway and confer RAF kinase dependency under those conditions. So that’s why we think there’s a potential to get a combination dose that’s tolerated in the clinic.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley</u>:</strong> I’ve heard that toxicity has always been the problem with the MEK inhibitors. Could you go down by a factor of two or four, do you think?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Malek</u>:</strong> That’s what we’re going to find out. It’s always a challenge developing these combinations. But from our preclinical data it does not look like we have to use cobimetinib at fully efficacious exposures. You see this pathway re-wiring at very low doses, down to 50, 100 nanomolar cobi. So our thinking about this has been, you’re better off reducing the dose of the MEK inhibitor, because that’s basically the strategy, to rewire, and then try and get the RAF inhibitor as high in dose as possible to inhibit RAF dimers. We’re using the MEK inhibitor essentially to confer the dependency and the RAF inhibitor is the real drug you’re using to get efficacy.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley</u>:</strong> Have you looked for resistance yet?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Malek</u>:</strong> It will be interesting because most of the mechanisms of resistance to the existing BRAF inhibitors, whether it’s complementing a dimer, driving dimerization, or it’s a splice variant, a RAS mutation, BRAF amplification, they’re basically driving RAF dimers. So I think it will be interesting in this case to see what pathway escape looks like.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley</u>:</strong> Chris, what was your role in this paper?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Klijn</u>:</strong> The pure computational part of the paper is the way we handled the drug screening, as well as some RNA seq. I think the major optimization was allowing us to do synergy screening over hundreds of cell lines. You can see that there are some full dose-matrix Bliss plots in here but those are laborious, and you can’t really scale those to the numbers that we wanted to scale them to. So in collaboration with the our functional genomics group, which is our screening core led by Scott Martin, we used co-dilution screens, where you basically screened a single agent over a dose range, and then at co-dilutions with two single agents. We developed ways to make sure that those curves are all comparable and that we get the right statistics out of them, so that you could see the biological effect as you see in the dot plots like the one in Figure 4a, represents quite a bit of work by very many many people, and also a lot of computational development. And then, obviously, the association of genomics afterwards, where we identified the G13Ds as being especially synergistic. All those things are basically grounded in the fact that the synergy statistics are quite robust.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley</u>:</strong> Chris, did you start out in the lab, or at a computer?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Klijn</u>:</strong> I was in the lab in the early stages of my career, I did my Ph.D. in the Netherlands Cancer Institute, working on genomics in mouse models, mostly. That’s where I made the switch to computational biology. And after my Ph.D. I moved to Genentech as a postdoc, and after I finished my postdoc I stayed on as a scientist.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Malek</u>:</strong> And it’s been a really effective way to do discovery science, with this close partnership where Chris is suggesting experiments, looking at the data so we have this iterative process going back and forth, and same thing with his team, he has a team of computational biolgists that work with several members of our department. Basically every scientist is partnered up with a computational biologist. And I think that’s basically essential now, because an individual scientist generates millions, billions of data points, and you need somebody who really understands how to view those big data sets, you need that close interaction to do the work at the scale that we want to do.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley</u>:</strong> Shiva, is there anything you’d like to say about women in science?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Malek</u>:</strong> I take my role as a scientific leader in this field really seriously, both obviously from a scientific standpoint to make contributions to the community, but also as a mentor for women. I’m co-organizing the upcoming <span><a href="https://www.aacr.org/Meetings/Pages/MeetingDetail.aspx?EventItemID=165#.WlPdgEtG2Ho">AACR RAS</a> </span>meeting with Karen Cichowski, Frank McCormick, and Gideon Bollag, and we put a lot of thought into the gender balance, making sure that was part of the discussion. I think we have a long ways to go the in the scientific community, I think we need more women at the table, in positions where we can influence, like on organizing committees, where you can open the discussion a little more. Genentech’s been a fantastic place, I talk a little bit about this in my <span><a href="https://www.gene.com/stories/the-gift-of-mentorship">Portrait</a></span>, and there is a strong network of women that really support each other that’s front and center for me every single day. We have senior leaders like Wendy Young, Lori Friedman, Sara Kenkare-Mitra , there are many that have done a lot to raise other women in the organization. I would like for us to build a network like that in the scientific community and particularly in the RAS community. With folks like Karen Cichowski, Sharon Campbell, Debbie Morrison and Dafna Bar-Sagi, there’s no shortage of great women in the field.</p>
        <p><strong><u>Hartley</u>:</strong> Chris, do you have any closing thoughts?</p>
        <p><strong><u>Klijn</u>:</strong> As a junior scientist in the field, as well as a computational scientist in the field, I think it is important to realize that the future of science is probably team-based science. It’s not going to be individuals in individual labs working on a given problem. The problems are too big and the amount of data being generated is too large. A lot of the projects we have here at Genentech are very collaborative and that’s the thing that I really enjoy.</p>

        <p>One of the prevailing mysteries of Ras is the disconnect between the known cell autonomous effectors of mutant Ras and the cascade of non-cell autonomous changes it induces in the local microenvironment. Despite outstanding progress by the Ras community in delineating the proximal pathways of Ras signaling, there are few secreted or cell-surface proteins represented on the resulting maps (including <a href="/research/key-initiatives/ras/ras-central/blog/2015/ras-pathway-v2" title="">Ras 2.0</a>). Yet alterations in the tumor microenvironment may be one of the most profound consequences of Ras activation. The cancers with a high frequency of Ras mutations (e.g. pancreatic, lung, and colon) are characterized by extensive desmoplasia and stromal cell infiltration, and many studies now find associations between Ras mutation and the activation of specific paracrine pathways that effect biological responses in stromal cells. Genetically engineered mouse models have been particularly useful in characterizing the paracrine effects of mutant Ras expression. A pancreatic cancer model based on tetracycline-inducible mutant K-ras demonstrated rapid stromal regression following withdrawal of mutant K-ras expression.<sup>1</sup> However, detailed molecular mechanisms linking direct Ras effector proteins to secreted/cell surface ligands remain elusive.</p>
        <p>Some of the most direct evidence of Ras–dependent paracrine signaling comes from studies of tumor development. Many inflammatory conditions predispose to related cancers (eg. chronic pancreatitis is a strong risk factor for pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma), yet acute inflammation is part of the normal, healthy response to tissue injury. An overly festive night out might injure some acinar cells in the pancreas, resulting in acinar-to-ductal metaplasia (ADM) and inflammation. Normally, after the tissue is repaired, ADM cells return to an acinar state and the acute inflammation resolves. However, in the context of a K-ras mutation, this cycle is broken and the tissue is unable to appropriately resolve the inflammatory response, leading to chronic inflammation and increasing cancer risk.<sup>2</sup></p>
        <p>Normal epithelial (glandular) tissues have a limited complement of stromal cells. For example, fibroblasts make up just a few percent of cells in the normal pancreas. However, in the setting of chronic inflammation, and later in cancer desmoplasia, fibroblasts and other stromal cell types can dominate the tissue parenchyma. A host of cytokines, chemokines, and other factors are secreted, leading to changes in cellular composition, remodeling of the extracellular matrix, increased mechanical stiffness of the tissue parenchyma, and modulation of the local immune microenvironment, all of which can promote malignancy. Another consequence of desmoplasia can be changes in tissue perfusion that limit the delivery of drugs to tumor tissues, reducing drug efficacy.<sup>3,4</sup></p>
        <p>Despite the obvious importance of these processes, we actually have a shockingly incomplete understanding of the cellular and extracellular composition of desmoplastic tumors. Fibroblasts, immunocytes, and endothelial cells are clearly major contributors, but these are all broad categories. How many different types of fibroblasts exist in a tumor? How do we visualize them? What are their functional distinctions? The question is even more complicated for immunocytes, a huge category comprising dozens of specific cell types with diverse and often opposing functional roles. Endothelial and lymphendothelial cells can vary in type and form, yielding diverse structures that control perfusion, oxygen saturation, nutrient levels, and other biophysical properties. There are also “immature” cell types such as mesenchymal stem cells, immature myeloid progenitor cells, and endothelial progenitor cells. The word “immature” is a diminutive and often equated to “non-functional”, but in truth such cells are associated with critical functions, as in the case of myeloid derived suppressor cells, which help mediate local immunosuppression. Moreover, there are cell types that exist outside the tumor mass that probably affect biology within the tumor. Tertiary lymph nodes can form in proximity to some tumors, perhaps reflecting a failed or coopted immune response against the tumor. Nerve cells project axonal processes into GI and other cancers, prostate, gastric, and pancreatic tumors, and make direct connections to specific subsets of malignant epithelial cells and potently influencing tumor biology.<sup>5</sup> Even within the malignant compartment, there is significant heterogeneity of differentiation states or progenitor identities. What is clear is that existing cell-specific markers fail to fully capture the heterogeneity of cellular composition within tumors and that even highly multiplexed flow cytometry or immunofluorescent technologies still struggle to provide an unbiased and complete representation of tissue composition. Advances in single-cell sequencing and CyTOF technologies6 may provide tractable means to properly quantify the diversity of cell types that contribute to even the most complex of solid tumors.</p>
        <p>The stroma regression observed in the inducible K-ras model<sup>6</sup> indicates that mutant Ras plays a major role in orchestrating this stromal response, but the mechanisms are limited to vignettes at this point. For example, K-ras mutation in the pancreas is associated with an increase in the expression of the Sonic Hedgehog ligand, which induces downstream pathway activity in certain fibroblasts to increase cell proliferation and collagen deposition.<sup>7,8</sup> Similarly, K-ras mutation is also associated with the overexpression of GM-CSF, which promotes the recruitment of immunosuppressive myeloid lineages.<sup>9</sup> In the latter case, inhibitors were used to ascertain that K-ras mediated induction of GM-CSF is dependent on both MAPK and PI3K, but the full mechanism leading to its elevated expression is cryptic. It is unclear whether Ras-dependent paracrine signals from the malignant cell can directly control all of the different cell types in the stroma. However, it is apparent that secondary signals propagate between different stromal cell types, indirectly responding to cues from Ras. One example of such a “paracrine cascade” is the indirect regulation of CD8+ T-cells by Gr-1+, CD11b+ myeloid cells responding to the K-ras dependent induction of GM-CSF.<sup>10</sup></p>
