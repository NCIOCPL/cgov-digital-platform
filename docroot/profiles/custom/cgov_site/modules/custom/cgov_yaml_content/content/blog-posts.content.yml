                      </p>
                      <p>People with advanced alveolar soft part sarcoma (ASPS), a rare cancer, appear to benefit from a type of <a href="/about-cancer/treatment/types/immunotherapy" title="">immunotherapy</a> called an <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000772606&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000772606&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">immune checkpoint inhibitor</a>, according to results from a small clinical trial.</p>
                      <p>The trial results were presented November 16 at the <a href="https://www.ctos.org/Meeting/2018AnnualMeeting.aspx">2018 annual meeting of the Connective Tissue Oncology Society</a><a class="icon-exit-notification" title="Exit Disclaimer" href="/policies/linking"><span class="hidden">Exit Disclaimer</span></a><span> (CTOS)</span>.</p>
                      <h2 id="ui-id-2">Striking People in their Prime</h2>
                      <p>ASPS is extremely rare, with fewer than 100 cases diagnosed each year in the United States. It starts in soft-tissue cells, such as muscle or fat. Unlike most other cancer types, it usually affects younger people: women and men in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, explained Dr. Schuetze.</p>
                      <p>The mainstay treatment for ASPS is surgery, sometimes combined with radiation therapy. But ASPS usually spreads to other parts of the body early in its course. Metastatic ASPS tumors, most often found in the lung or brain, tend to be slow-growing (<a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046355&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046355&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">indolent</a>) but eventually start to cause symptoms. Metastatic ASPS is always fatal, said the trial’s co-leader, Alice Chen, M.D., head of the Developmental Therapeutics Clinic in NCI’s <a href="https://dctd.cancer.gov/">Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD)</a>.</p>
                      <p>Chemotherapy is not effective in patients with metastatic ASPS. Over the last decade, however, small studies have shown that TKIs can sometimes slow the growth of metastatic disease. One TKI, <a href="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/pazopanibhydrochloride" title="">pazopanib (Votrient)</a>, has received Food and Drug Administration approval for treating soft-tissue sarcomas.</p>

                        <h3>ETCTN Advancing Clinical Trials for Rare Cancers</h3>
                        <p>The ETCTN was created by NCI to speed clinical trials of investigational drugs in rare cancer types in which there is unmet need for new treatments.</p>
                        <p>The ETCTN has participating investigators at more than 50 hospitals and treatment centers across the United States and Canada. This not only allows for rapid accrual for trials in rare cancers, “it allows patients to stay closer to home when they’re getting treatment,” said Dr. O’Sullivan Coyne.</p>
                        <p>NCI’s Developmental Therapeutics Clinic (DTC), which led the trial of atezolizumab in alveolar soft part sarcoma, is a member of the ETCTN. The DTC focuses on rationally developing new drugs and drug combinations that target specific abnormalities in tumors.</p>
                      </div>
                      <h2 id="ui-id-3">Better than Expected Responses</h2>
                      <p>Based on this research, Dr. O’Sullivan Coyne and Dr. Chen launched a <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search/v?q=NCT03141684&amp;loc=0&amp;rl=1&amp;id=NCI-2016-01040&amp;pn=1&amp;ni=10">phase 2 clinical trial of atezolizumab in metastatic ASPS</a> in early 2017. Because of the disease’s rarity, they ran the trial through NCI’s <a href="https://ctep.cancer.gov/initiativesPrograms/etctn.htm">Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN)</a><span> (see sidebar)</span>.</p>
                      <p>Overall, 24 patients with metastatic ASPS enrolled in the trial. Early results from the first 22 patients were presented at the CTOS meeting.</p>
                      <p>The researchers hope to expand the trial to include more patients with ASPS, as well as patients with two other rare sarcoma subtypes.</p>
                      <h2 id="ui-id-4">Future Research Directions</h2>
                      <p>In the future, “these results may encourage investigators to consider [patients with] ASPS for other immunotherapy trials. And I think it will also lead to more trials [just] in this rare tumor subtype,” said Dr. O’Sullivan Coyne, who received the CTOS Young Investigator Award for her work on the study.</p>
                      <p>At the CTOS meeting, researchers from several different countries expressed interest in testing atezolizumab to treat ASPS, including in combination with other therapies as well as in different sequences of administration, Dr. Chen noted.</p>

        <p><strong>Can you give us an overview of the application of immunology to cancer, the history and where we are in 2018?</strong></p>
        <p>Sure. Cancer immunotherapy is really the result of 30 to 40 years of basic immunology science. In the 1980s we had T cells being identified and the ability to identify cytokines, that was a major area of progress that went on into the 1990s.&nbsp; Viral diseases became an area of high inquiry during the 90s, and we were learning a lot about T cell recognition of viruses and how an antigen is processed and presented to a T cell.&nbsp; <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/medicine/laureates/2011/steinman-facts.html">Ralph Steinman</a><a class="icon-exit-notification" title="Exit Disclaimer" href="/policies/linking"><span class="hidden">Exit Disclaimer</span></a>&nbsp;was working on dendritic cells, which at first we thought were activating T cells but later realized they were regulating them. Then in the 1990s people like <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10209159">Jim Allison</a> and Liepin<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15970540">g Chen</a> were identifying regulatory signals on T cells, realizing that T cells are regulated by a number of different signals, CTLA4 and B7 1 and 2, and now we recognize that there are a panel of important T cell regulatory checkpoints. I think the early ones were real efforts in science to try to isolate and sequence, but with the development of technologies that were able to sequence the human genome, those were also applied to immunology.&nbsp; So during the early 2000s we were isolating all of the different checkpoint-activating and down-regulating signals on the T cell that interact with dendritic cells and in some cases tumors. That really allowed us to develop these antibodies that can alter the function of T cells through these signals. And in 2011 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ipilimumab">anti-CTLA4</a><a class="icon-exit-notification" title="Exit Disclaimer" href="/policies/linking"><span class="hidden">Exit Disclaimer</span></a> was the first to be approved and we've had now over 30 FDA approvals for multiple indications in different cancers.&nbsp; We would have expected melanoma being the first but what we weren't expecting was lung cancer and cancers such as head and neck and bladder and some of the others that were just not even on our radar to respond to immunotherapies.&nbsp; We were shocked.</p>
        <p><strong>A cancer that was full of hundreds or thousands of mutations was the worst news of all, wasn't it?</strong></p>
        <p>Yes! And suddenly we took patients who were resistant to chemotherapy, with metastatic disease going home to hospice, and turned them around to where they're living normal lives.&nbsp; About <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26028255">65 - 70% who got this treatment responded</a>. That's remarkable.&nbsp; So I hope that patients today can at least feel there is more hope than there was even ten years ago. And going on an early phase trial today is very different from going on an early phase trial even ten years ago.</p>
        <p><strong>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29658856">combination</a> of pembrolizumab and chemo is widely used now. The chemo is killing cancer cells but it is also making their antigens more accessible, or educating T-cells, is that correct?</strong></p>
        <p>We don't really know the full mechanism.&nbsp; The hypothesis is that the chemotherapy does a couple of things, it reduces the tumor burden quickly, because when you have a large tumor burden, immunotherapy can take a couple of months to see a response.&nbsp; So that's one thing.&nbsp; The other thing that chemotherapy will do is, as you said,&nbsp; we believe it releases antigens, similar to how we think <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oncolytic_virus">oncolytic viruses</a><a class="icon-exit-notification" title="Exit Disclaimer" href="/policies/linking"><span class="hidden">Exit Disclaimer</span></a> work. Chemotherapy may also be releasing toxins, cytokines and chemokines,&nbsp; which bring in inflammatory cells to clean up the tumor damage, and these inflammatory cells may in turn present antigens to the T cells. So we think that's how it works but to be honest with you, there isn't great data.&nbsp; What I can tell you is that preclinically there is data for the different chemotherapy agents, and they all have different effects on the immune system.&nbsp; For instance, we've&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20346445">published</a> on the taxols and they enhance the antigen-processing machinery in dendritic cells.&nbsp; They're specific for dendritic cells, and probably for a specific population of dendritic cells.&nbsp; And cyclophosphamide and gemcitibine reduce the suppressive cells, the myeloid-derived suppressor cells in mouse models. There may be many mechanisms, and there are not a lot of studies yet, particularly in humans, showing specifically how chemotherapies affect the immune system. We've always thought, you give chemotherapy and it kills cancers, it stops cells that are proliferating, but we now know they have a lot of effects, and I think it's a whole area that we need to investigate more. I suspect that looking at different dosing, looking at different sequencing, of these agents and what they're targeting would be very helpful for figuring out how to combine these with the newer agents that are being developed and approved as therapies, whether they're immunotherapies or targeted therapies.</p>
        <p><strong>If I were a cancer patient and not scientifically sophisticated, how would I find the best care, or a good clinical trial?</strong></p>
        <p>Very important question.&nbsp; I was one of the co-chairs of the Blue Ribbon Panel and worked on the Moon Shot and continue to work with the Biden Initiative, and one area that the Moonshot under Vice President Biden's leadership was to try to bring all the communities together to have an easy access for patients, to help them figure out what the clinical trials were, and even be able to access clinical trials based on their genetic information and other information. That's a work in progress, there are some pilots studies for that, but in the meantime, it's very hard with the lists [of clinical trials] that are available in different places. If you have a cancer that has a foundation, they can tell you what priority clinical trials are available, and I always encourage people to contact these foundations. The American Association for Cancer Research will also be helpful in connecting patients to the right places.&nbsp; Having a National Cancer Institute-designated cancer center in your area, I would always look there, they always have lists and those are going to be the most scientifically rational studies.&nbsp;</p>
        <p><strong>Congratulations on your election as the president of AACR.</strong></p>
        <p>Thank you. It's an opportunity to really help in ways that I could not help before, so this really cool.</p>
        <p><strong>I have read that cardiotoxicity is an issue, with both chemotherapy and also with targeted therapies.</strong></p>
        <p>That's something we want to prevent in the future. We don't want to overtreat, and we don't want to give the wrong treatments if you're predisposed.&nbsp; As treatments become more diverse we need to do more understand their long-term consequences.</p>

        <p>
          Dr. Elizabeth Jaffee is Professor of Oncology and Associate Director of the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at 
          Johns Hopkins, and President of the American Association for Cancer Research for 2018-2019. In 2016 she spoke with RAS Dialogue 
          editors about her career and immune approaches to treating cancer. Recently she spoke with us again about where immunotherapy is 
          today and where cancer treatments and research need to go in the coming decade.
