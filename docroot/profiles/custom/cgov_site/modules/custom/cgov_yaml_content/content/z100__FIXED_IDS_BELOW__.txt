All of the YAML content below this file have FIXED node ids starting at 5000. (Node IDs are incremental) These IDs are fixed so they can be referenced in configs and other locations.
DO NOT USE THE SAME IDS!!! YOU WILL JUST UPDATE THAT NODE AND REPLACE EVERYTHING.

See ../dev_blocks/README.md for more info.
