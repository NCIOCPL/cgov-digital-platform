            <p>The trial results were presented November 16 at the <a href="https://www.ctos.org/Meeting/2018AnnualMeeting.aspx">2018 annual meeting of the Connective Tissue Oncology Society</a><a class="icon-exit-notification" title="Exit Disclaimer" href="/policies/linking"><span class="hidden">Exit Disclaimer</span></a><span> (CTOS)</span>.</p>
            <h2 id="ui-id-2">Striking People in their Prime</h2>
            <p>ASPS is extremely rare, with fewer than 100 cases diagnosed each year in the United States. It starts in soft-tissue cells, such as muscle or fat. Unlike most other cancer types, it usually affects younger people: women and men in their 20s, 30s, and 40s, explained Dr. Schuetze.</p>
            <p>The mainstay treatment for ASPS is surgery, sometimes combined with radiation therapy. But ASPS usually spreads to other parts of the body early in its course. Metastatic ASPS tumors, most often found in the lung or brain, tend to be slow-growing (<a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046355&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046355&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">indolent</a>) but eventually start to cause symptoms. Metastatic ASPS is always fatal, said the trial’s co-leader, Alice Chen, M.D., head of the Developmental Therapeutics Clinic in NCI’s <a href="https://dctd.cancer.gov/">Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis (DCTD)</a>.</p>
            <p>Chemotherapy is not effective in patients with metastatic ASPS. Over the last decade, however, small studies have shown that TKIs can sometimes slow the growth of metastatic disease. One TKI, <a href="/about-cancer/treatment/drugs/pazopanibhydrochloride" title="">pazopanib (Votrient)</a>, has received Food and Drug Administration approval for treating soft-tissue sarcomas.</p>

              <h3>ETCTN Advancing Clinical Trials for Rare Cancers</h3>
              <p>The ETCTN was created by NCI to speed clinical trials of investigational drugs in rare cancer types in which there is unmet need for new treatments.</p>
              <p>The ETCTN has participating investigators at more than 50 hospitals and treatment centers across the United States and Canada. This not only allows for rapid accrual for trials in rare cancers, “it allows patients to stay closer to home when they’re getting treatment,” said Dr. O’Sullivan Coyne.</p>
              <p>NCI’s Developmental Therapeutics Clinic (DTC), which led the trial of atezolizumab in alveolar soft part sarcoma, is a member of the ETCTN. The DTC focuses on rationally developing new drugs and drug combinations that target specific abnormalities in tumors.</p>
            </div>
            <h2 id="ui-id-3">Better than Expected Responses</h2>
            <p>Based on this research, Dr. O’Sullivan Coyne and Dr. Chen launched a <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search/v?q=NCT03141684&amp;loc=0&amp;rl=1&amp;id=NCI-2016-01040&amp;pn=1&amp;ni=10">phase 2 clinical trial of atezolizumab in metastatic ASPS</a> in early 2017. Because of the disease’s rarity, they ran the trial through NCI’s <a href="https://ctep.cancer.gov/initiativesPrograms/etctn.htm">Experimental Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network (ETCTN)</a><span> (see sidebar)</span>.</p>
            <p>Overall, 24 patients with metastatic ASPS enrolled in the trial. Early results from the first 22 patients were presented at the CTOS meeting.</p>
            <p>The researchers hope to expand the trial to include more patients with ASPS, as well as patients with two other rare sarcoma subtypes.</p>
            <h2 id="ui-id-4">Future Research Directions</h2>
            <p>In the future, “these results may encourage investigators to consider [patients with] ASPS for other immunotherapy trials. And I think it will also lead to more trials [just] in this rare tumor subtype,” said Dr. O’Sullivan Coyne, who received the CTOS Young Investigator Award for her work on the study.</p>
            <p>At the CTOS meeting, researchers from several different countries expressed interest in testing atezolizumab to treat ASPS, including in combination with other therapies as well as in different sequences of administration, Dr. Chen noted.</p>
