            <p>Samples of KRAS protein were recently launched to the International Space Station for <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/explorer/Investigation.html?#id=7885">crystallization trials</a> in low earth orbit.</p>

            <p>More than 30 percent of all human cancers &ndash; including 95 percent of pancreatic cancers and 45 percent of colorectal cancers &mdash; are driven by mutations of the <i>RAS</i> family of genes. NCI established the RAS initiative in 2013 to explore innovative approaches for attacking the proteins encoded by mutant forms of <i>RAS</i> genes and to ultimately create effective, new therapies for <i>RAS</i>-related cancers.</p>
