            cancer will be the most frequently diagnosed nonskin malignancy in U.S. women
            in 2018.<a href="#cit/section_3.1">1</a>  Also in 2018, breast cancer will kill an estimated 40,920
            women, second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer mortality in women.
            Breast cancer also occurs in men, and it is estimated that   2,550 new cases will be diagnosed in
            2018.<a href="#cit/section_3.1">1</a>    Despite a prior long-term trend of gradually increasing breast cancer
            incidence in women, data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results
            Program show a decrease in breast cancer mortality of 1.8% per year from 2005 to 2014.<a href="#cit/section_3.2">2</a><a href="#cit/section_3.3">3</a></p><p id="_624" tabindex="-1">The major risk factor for breast cancer is advancing age.  A 30-year-old woman has a 1 in 250 chance of being diagnosed with breast cancer in the next 10 years, whereas a 70-year-old woman has a 1 in 27 chance.<a href="#cit/section_3.4">4</a></p><p id="_679" tabindex="-1">Breast cancer incidence and mortality risk also vary on the basis of geography, culture, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status. Compared with other races, white women have a higher incidence of breast cancer that may be attributable, in part, to screening behavior. However, breast cancer incidence rates increased slightly in black women  by 0.3% per year between 2005 and 2014, resulting in the convergence of rates in blacks
            with those in whites.<a href="#cit/section_3.1">1</a><a href="#cit/section_3.5">5</a></p><p id="_625" tabindex="-1">Screening by mammography decreases breast cancer mortality by identifying cases for treatment at an earlier stage. However, screening also identifies more cases than would become symptomatic in a woman&#x2019;s lifetime, so screening increases breast cancer incidence.

Estrogen and progestin cause growth and proliferation of breast cells that may work through growth factors such as transforming growth factor (TGF)-alpha.<a href="#cit/section_3.8">8</a> These hormones, whether endogenous or exogenous, may promote the development and proliferation of breast cancer cells.
            </p><p id="_36" tabindex="-1">International variation in breast cancer rates may be explained by differences in genetics, reproductive factors, diet, exercise and screening behavior.  Some of these factors are modifiable, as evidenced by the observation that Japanese immigrants to the United States increase their breast cancer risk from lower Japanese levels to higher American levels within two generations.<a href="#cit/section_3.9">9</a><a href="#cit/section_3.10">10</a><a href="#cit/section_3.11">11</a>
            </p></section><section id="_37"><h3 id="_37_toc">Endogenous Estrogen</h3><p id="_276" tabindex="-1">Many of the risk factors for breast cancer suggest that longer exposure to endogenous estrogen plays a role in the development of the disease. Women who experienced menarche at age 11 years or younger have about a 20% greater chance of developing breast cancer than do those who experienced menarche at age 14 years or older.<a href="#cit/section_3.12">12</a><a href="#cit/section_3.13">13</a><a href="#cit/section_3.14">14</a> Women who experience late menopause also have an increased risk.

Following ovarian ablation,
            breast cancer risk may be reduced as much as 75% depending on age, weight, and parity, with the greatest reduction for young,
            thin, nulliparous women.<a href="#cit/section_3.19">19</a><a href="#cit/section_3.20">20</a><a href="#cit/section_3.21">21</a><a href="#cit/section_3.22">22</a> The removal of one ovary
            also reduces the risk of breast cancer but to a lesser degree than does the removal
            of both ovaries.<a href="#cit/section_3.23">23</a>
            </p><p id="_39" tabindex="-1">Other hormonal changes also

It is likely that reproductive risk factors interact with predisposing genotypes. For example, in the Nurses&#x2019; Health Study,<a href="#cit/section_3.24">24</a> the associations between age at first birth, menarche, and menopause and the development of breast cancer were observed only among women without a family history of breast cancer in a mother or sister.</p></section><section id="_701"><h3 id="_701_toc">Inherited Risk</h3><p id="_702" tabindex="-1">Breast cancer risk increases in women with a positive family history, particularly if first-degree relatives are affected.<a href="#cit/section_3.24">24</a>  The following risk assessment models, derived from databases, cohort, and case-control studies, quantitate this risk:</p><div class="pdq-content-list"><ul id="_741"><li><a href="https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov" title="https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov">Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool [Gail Model]</a>.</li><li><a href="https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk/intro.htm" title="https://tools.bcsc-scc.org/BC5yearRisk/intro.htm">Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium [BCSC] Risk Calculator</a>.</li><li><a href="https://www.breastcancergenescreen.org/" title="https://www.breastcancergenescreen.org/">Breast Cancer Referral Screening Tool [B-RST]</a>.</li><li><a href="http://halls.md/breast/risk.htm" title="http://halls.md/breast/risk.htm">Hall Detailed Breast Risk Calculator</a>.</li><li><a href="http://www.ems-trials.org/riskevaluator/" title="http://www.ems-trials.org/riskevaluator/">IBIS Breast Cancer Risk Calculator Tool</a>.</li></ul></div><p id="_742" tabindex="-1">Specific abnormal alleles are associated with approximately 5% of breast cancers.

Mammographic density also confounds the identification of cancers by that technology.  The extent of increased risk was described in a report of three nested case-control studies in screened populations with 1,112 matched case-control pairs.  Compared with women with density comprising less than 10% of breast tissue, women with density in 75% or more of their breast had an increased risk of breast cancer (odds ratio [OR], 4.7; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.0&#x2013;7.4), whether the cancer was detected by screening (OR, 3.5; 95% CI, 2.0&#x2013;6.2) or detected less than 12 months after a negative screening examination (OR, 17.8; 95% CI, 4.8&#x2013;65.9). Increased risk of breast cancer, whether detected by screening or other means, persisted for at least 8 years after study entry and was greater in younger women than in older women. For women younger than the median age of 56 years, 26% of all breast cancers and 50% of cancers detected less than 12 months after a negative screening test were identified in women with mammographic breast density of 50% or more.<a href="#cit/section_3.34">34</a><a href="#cit/section_3.35">35</a></p><p id="_705" tabindex="-1">Women with dense breasts have increased risk, proportionate to the degree of density.

After a mean follow-up of 6.8 years, the RR for breast cancer was 1.27 (95% CI, 0.84&#x2013;1.94).

The trial was terminated early because combined HT did not decrease coronary heart disease risk but did increase the risk of stroke and breast cancer. An increased rate of invasive breast cancer risk  (hazard ratio [HR], 1.24; 95% CI, 1.02&#x2013;1.50), but not for <em>in situ</em> breast cancer,  was observed in all subgroups of women. The combined HT-related cancers had similar grade, histology, and expression of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor, and <em>HER2</em>/neu, with a trend toward larger size and higher incidence of lymph node metastases in the combined HT group.<a href="#cit/section_3.41">41</a> Extended follow-up  of a mean of 11 years showed higher breast cancer&#x2013;specific mortality for the HT group (25 vs. 12 deaths, 0.03% vs. 0.01% per year; HR, 1.95; 95% CI, 1.0&#x2013;4.04; <em>P</em> = .049). Combined HT was also associated with a higher percentage of abnormal mammograms.<a href="#cit/section_3.42">42</a></p><p id="_544" tabindex="-1">The WHI observational study was conducted in parallel with the WHI randomized controlled trial (RCT), recruiting postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years.  An analysis was conducted in the observational study of the WHI to further examine the  prognosis of women taking combination HT who were diagnosed with breast cancer and the risks based on time between menopause and initiation of HT. After a mean follow-up of 11.3 years,  the annualized incidence of breast cancer among women using estrogen plus progestin  was 0.60%, compared with 0.42% among nonusers (HR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.41&#x2013;1.70). Survival after the diagnosis of breast cancer was similar for combined HT users and nonusers.  Death from breast cancer was higher among combined HT users than among nonusers, but the difference was not statistically significant (HR, 1.3; 94% CI, 0.90&#x2013;1.93).  Risks were highest among women initiating HT at the time of menopause, and risks diminished but persisted  with increasing time between menopause and starting combination HT.     All-cause mortality after the diagnosis of breast cancer was statistically significantly higher among combined HT users than among nonusers (HR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.37&#x2013;2.54.)  Overall, these findings were consistent with results from the RCT.<a href="#cit/section_3.43">43</a></p><p id="_511" tabindex="-1">The WHI also studied women who had previously undergone a hysterectomy and thus were not at risk for endometrial cancer, which is associated with unopposed estrogen therapy. Women aged 50 to 79 years (N = 10,739) were randomly assigned to receive conjugated equine estrogen (CEE) or placebo. This trial was also stopped early because of an increased risk of stroke and no improvement in a global risk-benefit index.<a href="#cit/section_3.44">44</a><a href="#cit/section_3.45">45</a> After an average 6.8 years of follow-up, breast cancer incidence was lower in the group receiving CEE (0.26% per year vs. 0.33%; HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.59&#x2013;1.01). The global risk-benefit index was slightly worse for CEE.<a href="#cit/section_3.44">44</a> An extended follow-up for a median of 11.8 years included 78% of the trial participants.<a href="#cit/section_3.45">45</a><a href="#cit/section_3.46">46</a> Results seen in the initial study persisted, with a similar risk reduction for breast cancer in CEE recipients  (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.62&#x2013;0.95) <a href="#cit/section_3.45">45</a><a href="#cit/section_3.46">46</a> and a decrease in breast cancer mortality (6 vs. 16 deaths; HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.13&#x2013;0.91). All-cause mortality was also lower in the CEE group (0.046% vs. 0.076% per year; HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39&#x2013;0.97). After CEE was discontinued, the risk of stroke decreased in the postintervention period. Over the entire follow-up period, there was no difference in the incidence of coronary heart disease, deep vein thrombosis, stroke, hip fracture, or colorectal cancer.<a href="#cit/section_3.45">45</a> Breast cancer incidence was similar for women who initiated CEE or placebo within the first 5 years after onset of menopause (HR, 1.06; 95% CI, 0.74&#x2013;1.51).</p><p id="_535" tabindex="-1">A Danish trial of HT for 1,006 women entering menopause was designed to evaluate cardiovascular outcomes.  Combined HT (triphasic estradiol and norethisterone) was given to 407 women with intact uteri, and estradiol was given to 95 women who had undergone hysterectomy.  Controls (407 with intact uteri and 97 with hysterectomy) were not treated.  At 10 years, there was considerable contamination. Only one-half of the women assigned to the HT group were still taking the prescribed HT, and 22% of the control women had begun HT.  Cardiovascular outcomes favored HT-treated women, and there was no difference in breast cancer incidence.<a href="#cit/section_3.47">47</a></p><p id="_627" tabindex="-1">Observational studies augment the information obtained in RCTs.</p><p id="_512" tabindex="-1">The Million Women Study <a href="#cit/section_3.48">48</a> recruited 1,084,110 women aged 50 to 64 years in the United Kingdom between 1996 and 2001 and obtained information about HT use and other personal details.  The women were followed for breast cancer incidence and death.  One-half of the women had used HT.  At 2.6 years of follow up, there were 9,364 invasive breast cancers; at 4.1 years, there were 637 breast cancer deaths.  Current users of HT at recruitment were more likely than never-users to develop breast cancer (adjusted RR = 1.66; 95% CI, 1.58&#x2013;1.75; <em>P</em> &lt; .0001) and to die from the disease (adjusted RR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.00&#x2013;1.48; <em>P</em> = .05). Past users of HT were, however, not at an increased risk of incident or fatal breast cancer (1.01 [95% CI, 0.94&#x2013;1.09] and 1.05 [95% CI, 0.82&#x2013;1.34], respectively). Incidence was significantly increased for current users of estrogen only (RR, 1.30; 95% CI, 1.21&#x2013;1.40; <em>P</em> &lt; .0001), combined HT (RR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.88&#x2013;2.12; <em>P</em> &lt; .0001), and tibolone (RR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.25&#x2013;1.68; <em>P</em> &lt; .0001).

In contrast, the association between estrogen-only HT and breast cancer incidence is confusing because some studies show increased risk and some show protection.  It is possible that the timing of estrogen-only HT in relation to the onset of menopause is critical.  Furthermore, observational studies may not account for different screening behavior between HT users and nonusers, whereas RCTs, by design, will control that variable.<a href="#cit/section_3.50">50</a><a href="#cit/section_3.51">51</a></p><p id="_494" tabindex="-1">Following publication of the WHI results, HT use dropped dramatically in the United States and elsewhere.

Lung cancer is more common in men than women and in those of lower socioeconomic status.  Patterns of lung cancer according to demographic characteristics tend to be strongly correlated with historical patterns of cigarette smoking prevalence.  An exception to this is the very high rate of lung cancer in African American men, a group whose very high lung cancer death rate is not explainable simply by historical smoking patterns.<a href="#cit/section_1.1">1</a></p><p id="_168" tabindex="-1">In nonsmokers, important lung cancer risk factors are exposure to secondhand smoke, exposure to ionizing radiation, and occupational exposure to lung carcinogens, such as asbestos. Radiation exposures relevant to the general population include environmental exposure to radon and radiation exposures administered in the medical care setting, particularly when administered at high doses, such as radiation therapy to the chest or breast.<a href="#cit/section_1.2">2</a> Cigarette smoking often interacts with these other factors.  There are several examples, including radon exposure and asbestos exposure, in which the combined exposure to cigarette smoke plus another risk factor results in an increase in risk that is much greater than the sum of the risks associated with each factor alone.</p><section id="_172"><h4 id="_172_toc">Factors associated with increased risk of lung cancer</h4><section id="_173"><h5 id="_173_toc">Cigarette smoking</h5><p id="_174" tabindex="-1">Starting with the 1964 Surgeon General&#x2019;s Report and followed by each subsequent Surgeon General&#x2019;s Report that has included a review of the evidence on smoking and lung cancer, an enormous body of scientific evidence clearly documents that cigarette smoking causes lung cancer, and that cigarette smoking is the major cause of lung cancer.</p><p id="_175" tabindex="-1">Based on solid evidence, cigarette smoking causes lung cancer. The risks of lung cancer associated with cigarette smoking are dose-dependent and increase markedly according to the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked.

            154,050 deaths predicted in 2018 in men and women combined.<a href="#cit/section_2.1">1</a> Lung cancer causes more deaths per year in the United States than the next four leading causes of cancer death combined.  Lung cancer incidence and
            mortality rates increased markedly throughout most of the last century, first in
            men and then in women.  The trends in lung cancer incidence and mortality rates  have closely mirrored historical patterns of smoking prevalence, after accounting for an appropriate latency period. Because of historical differences in smoking prevalence between men and women, lung cancer rates in men have been consistently declining  since the mid-1980s, but rates in women have only been declining since the mid-2000s. The incidence rate in men declined from a high of 102.1 cases per 100,000 men in 1984 to 78.6 cases per 100,000 men in 2011.<a href="#cit/section_2.1">1</a><a href="#cit/section_2.2">2</a>   In the United States, it  is estimated that lung cancer will account for about 25% of new cancer cases and about 25% of all cancer deaths in 2018. Lung
            cancer is  the leading cause of cancer deaths in both men and women.  In 2018, it
            is estimated that  70,500 deaths will occur among U.S. women due to lung
            cancer, compared with  40,920 deaths due to breast cancer.<a href="#cit/section_2.1">1</a></p><p id="_219" tabindex="-1">Lung cancer incidence and mortality is highest in African Americans compared with any other racial/ethnic group in the United States, primarily due to the very high rates in African American men. Between 2010 and 2014, the incidence rate in black men was higher than in white men (83.7 vs.  65.9 cases per 100,000 men, respectively), whereas among women no racial difference in incidence rates was present (49 vs. 50.8 cases  per 100,000 women, respectively). Similarly, the mortality rates among black men were higher than among white men during the same time frame (68 vs. 55.9 deaths per 100,000 men, respectively), whereas the mortality rates among black women were  lower than among white women (34.6 vs. 37.5 deaths per 100,000 women, respectively).<a href="#cit/section_2.3">3</a></p><p id="_220" tabindex="-1">Surgical treatment or radiation therapy is the treatment of choice for early

Lung cancer survival is worse for men compared with women and for blacks compared with whites.  For example, 5-year lung cancer survival was  lower in black men compared with white men (12.5% vs. 15.4%, respectively) and  lower in black women compared with white women (18.8% vs. 21.4%, respectively).<a href="#cit/section_2.5">5</a></p><p id="_221" tabindex="-1">The hypothesis has been proposed that women may be more susceptible than men to smoking-caused lung cancer.

            in cigarette smoking,  the predominant cause of lung cancer.  The  threefold
            variation in lung cancer mortality rates across the United States more or less parallels
            long-standing state-specific differences in the prevalence of cigarette smoking.  For example,  average annual age-adjusted lung cancer death rates for 1996 to 2000 were
            highest in Kentucky (78 deaths per 100,000 individuals) where 31%  were current

            effective  prevention and treatment strategies.  Two  important concepts in this regard  are the multistep nature of carcinogenesis and the diffuse field-wide
            carcinogenic process.  Epithelial cancers in the lung appear to develop in a
            series of steps extending over years.  Epithelial carcinogenesis is
            conceptually divided into three phases: initiation, promotion, and progression.
            This process has been inferred from human studies identifying
            clinical-histological premalignant lesions (e.g., metaplasia and dysplasia).
            The concept of field carcinogenesis is that multiple independent neoplastic
            lesions occurring within the lung can result from repeated exposure to
            carcinogens, primarily tobacco.  Patients developing cancers of the
            aerodigestive tract secondary to cigarette smoke also are likely to have
            multiple premalignant lesions of independent origin within the
            carcinogen-exposed field.  The concepts of multistep and field carcinogenesis
            provide a model for prevention studies.<a href="#cit/section_2.11">11</a></p></section><section id="_227"><h3 id="_227_toc">Risk Factors</h3><section id="_228"><h4 id="_228_toc">Factors associated with increased risk of lung cancer</h4><section id="_229"><h5 id="_229_toc">Cigarette smoking</h5><p id="_230" tabindex="-1">The most important risk factor for lung cancer (and for many other cancers) is cigarette smoking.<a href="#cit/section_2.12">12</a><a href="#cit/section_2.13">13</a><a href="#cit/section_2.14">14</a> Epidemiologic data have established that cigarette smoking is the predominant cause of lung cancer.

The manufactured cigarette has changed over time, but there is no evidence to suggest that changes such as <em>low tar</em> or <em>low nicotine</em> cigarettes have resulted in reduced lung cancer risks.<a href="#cit/section_2.9">9</a><a href="#cit/section_2.15">15</a>  Cigarette smoking is the most important contributor to the lung cancer burden because of its high prevalence of use and because cigarette smokers tend to smoke frequently, but cigar and pipe smoking have also been associated independently in case-control and cohort studies with increased lung cancer risk.<a href="#cit/section_2.16">16</a><a href="#cit/section_2.17">17</a> The cigar risks are of particular concern because of the increased prevalence of cigar use in the United States.<a href="#cit/section_2.18">18</a></p><p id="_231" tabindex="-1">The development of lung cancer is the culmination of multistep carcinogenesis. Genetic damage caused by chronic exposure to carcinogens, such as  those in cigarette smoke, is the driving force behind the multistep process. Evidence of genetic damage is the association of cigarette smoking with the formation of the DNA adducts in human lung tissue. A strong link between tobacco smoke and lung carcinogenesis has been established by molecular data.<a href="#cit/section_2.19">19</a><a href="#cit/section_2.20">20</a> </p></section><section id="_232"><h5 id="_232_toc">Secondhand tobacco smoke</h5><p id="_233" tabindex="-1">Secondhand tobacco smoke is also an established cause of lung cancer.<a href="#cit/section_2.21">21</a> Secondhand smoke has the same components as inhaled mainstream smoke, though in lower absolute concentrations, between 1% and 10% depending on the constituent. Elevated biomarkers of tobacco exposure, including urinary cotinine, urinary 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butanone (NNK) metabolites, and carcinogen-protein adducts, are seen in those who are exposed to secondhand cigarette smoke.<a href="#cit/section_2.22">22</a><a href="#cit/section_2.23">23</a><a href="#cit/section_2.24">24</a></p></section><section id="_234"><h5 id="_234_toc">Family history</h5><p id="_235" tabindex="-1">A positive family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer.

Many lung carcinogens have been identified in studies of high occupational exposures. Considered in total, occupational exposures have been estimated to account for approximately 10% of lung cancers.<a href="#cit/section_2.28">28</a> These carcinogens include asbestos, radon, tar and soot (sources of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, and cadmium.<a href="#cit/section_2.29">29</a> For many of these workplace carcinogens, cigarette smoking interacts synergistically to increase the risk.<a href="#cit/section_2.30">30</a> In developed countries, workplace exposures to these agents have largely been controlled.</p></section><section id="_241"><h6 id="_241_toc">Radiation exposure</h6><p id="_329" tabindex="-1">Based on studies of populations exposed to high doses of radiation, lung cancer has been determined to be one of the cancers that is causally associated with exposure to ionizing radiation.<a href="#cit/section_2.31">31</a>   Two types of radiation that are relevant to lung cancer include high-energy ionizing electromagnetic radiation (such as x-rays and gamma rays) and particles (such as alpha particles and neutrons).  </p><p id="_330" tabindex="-1">An important early source of data about radiation exposure came from studies of atomic bomb survivors in Japan; these studies demonstrated that a single high-dose exposure to gamma rays  is sufficient to increase the risk of lung cancer in a dose-dependent fashion.<a href="#cit/section_2.32">32</a>  Lung cancer risk in patients treated with radiation for a number of medical conditions has also been evaluated.  Studies of patients with tuberculosis who were treated with pneumothorax and monitored with frequent fluoroscopy, with resulting cumulative radiation doses of about 85 rads (0.85 Gy) staggered over time, indicated that any lung cancer risks associated with this exposure pattern, if they exist, are difficult to detect.<a href="#cit/section_2.33">33</a><a href="#cit/section_2.34">34</a>  In contrast, the results of many studies provide clear-cut evidence that radiation therapy to the chest to treat cancer results in an increased risk of lung cancer in a dose-dependent manner.

Radon is an inert gas produced naturally in the decay series of uranium.  Along with other supportive scientific evidence, studies of underground uranium miners exposed to very high levels of radon have demonstrated that radon exposure causes lung cancer.<a href="#cit/section_2.31">31</a> This effect is amplified considerably in miners who smoke.<a href="#cit/section_2.44">44</a>

Health indicators including respiratory systems, sensory symptoms, and hospital admissions were reported as outcomes in 25 studies.  With respect to health outcomes, a consistent finding was reduced hospital admissions for cardiac events. Evidence suggested that smoke-free workplace legislation may also result in reduced prevalence of active cigarette smoking; for example, one study observed a 32% decreased smoking prevalence in a county that enacted smoke-free workplace legislation compared with a 2.8% decrease in nearby counties with no smoke-free workplace legislation.</p></section></section><section id="_266"><h4 id="_266_toc">Preventing occupational exposure to lung carcinogens</h4><p id="_267" tabindex="-1">After cigarette smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke, occupational exposure to lung carcinogens, such as asbestos, arsenic, nickel, and chromium, is the most important contributor to the lung cancer burden. When occupational exposure to lung carcinogens are all considered together, 9% to 15% of all lung cancer deaths can be attributed to occupational exposure to lung carcinogens.<a href="#cit/section_2.9">9</a>  Reducing or eliminating workplace exposures to known lung carcinogens would be expected to result in a corresponding decrease in the risk of lung cancer.  Consequently, the proportion of the lung cancer burden attributable to occupational exposures is declining over time in countries like the United States that have taken steps to protect the workforce from exposure to known lung carcinogens.</p></section></section><section id="_268"><h3 id="_268_toc">Interventions Associated With Increased Risk of Lung Cancer</h3><section id="_269"><h4 id="_269_toc">Beta-carotene supplementation in smokers</h4><p id="_270" tabindex="-1">Results of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) trial were first

            incidence.  The trial was terminated early by the Data Monitoring Committee and NCI because its results confirmed the ATBC finding of a harmful

Dos conceptos importantes relacionados son la naturaleza de etapas m&#xFA;ltiples de la carcinogenia y el proceso carcinog&#xE9;nico difuso con difusi&#xF3;n a todo el campo. Los c&#xE1;nceres epiteliales de pulm&#xF3;n parecen presentarse en una serie de etapas que se extienden a lo largo de los a&#xF1;os. La carcinogenia epitelial se divide conceptualmente en tres fases: inicio, promoci&#xF3;n y progresi&#xF3;n. Este proceso se infiri&#xF3; de estudios en seres humanos en los que se identifican lesiones cl&#xED;nico-histol&#xF3;gicas premalignas (por ejemplo, metaplasia y displasia).
