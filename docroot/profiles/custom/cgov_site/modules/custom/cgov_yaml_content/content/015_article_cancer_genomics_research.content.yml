            <p>The study of cancer genomes has revealed abnormalities in genes that drive the development and growth of many types of cancer. This knowledge has improved our understanding of the biology of cancer and led to new methods of diagnosing and treating the disease.</p>
            <p>For example, the discovery of cancer-causing genetic and <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000717443&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000717443&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">epigenetic</a> changes in tumors has enabled the development of therapies that target these changes as well as diagnostic tests that identify patients who may benefit from these therapies. One such targeted drug is vemurafenib (Zelboraf), which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 2011 for the treatment of some patients with melanoma who have a specific <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046063&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046063&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">mutation</a> in the <i>BRAF</i> gene as detected by an FDA-approved test.</p>
            <p>Over the past decade, large-scale research projects have begun to survey and catalog the genomic changes associated with a number of types of cancer. These efforts have revealed unexpected genetic similarities across different types of tumors. For instance, mutations in the <i>HER2</i> gene (distinct from amplifications of this gene, for which therapies have been developed for breast, esophageal, and gastric cancers) have been found in a number of cancers, including breast, bladder, pancreatic, and ovarian.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Researchers have also shown that a given type of cancer, such as breast, lung, and stomach, may have several molecular subtypes. For some types of cancer, the existence of certain subtypes had not been known until researchers began to profile the genomes of tumor cells.</p>
            <p>The results of these projects illustrate the diverse landscape of genetic alterations in cancer and provide a foundation for understanding the molecular basis of this group of diseases.</p>

New technologies and the knowledge gained from previous genomic studies could be used to define the full set of driver mutations and other alterations to DNA and RNA in many cancers. Studies that compare genomic information from tumors and normal tissue from the same patient allow researchers to discover genomic changes that may drive cancer.</p>
            <p>Another opportunity is to expand the current use of genomic methods to investigate the molecular basis of clinical phenotypes. This approach could help researchers identify genetic changes that may distinguish aggressive cancers from <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046355&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046355&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">indolent</a> ones, for example.

            <p>Comprehensive analysis of cancer genomes has revealed a great deal of diversity in the genetic abnormalities found within cancers of a single type. Moreover, recurrent genetic alterations within these cancers are often involved in only a small percentage of cases. Identifying which genetic changes initiate cancer development and discovering rare genetic alterations that drive cancers are therefore challenges for the field.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Another challenge is acquiring high-quality biological samples needed for genomic studies, particularly for tumor types that are uncommon or rare, or those not treated primarily by surgery.</p>

            <p>Aunque se han identificado por medio de estudios de investigaci&oacute;n un gran n&uacute;mero de alteraciones gen&eacute;ticas que impulsan la formaci&oacute;n y el avance de muchos tipos de c&aacute;ncer, no se han caracterizado con profundidad algunos tipos de tumores. Se podr&iacute;an usar nuevas tecnolog&iacute;as y conocimientos obtenidos de estudios gen&oacute;micos previos para definir el conjunto completo de mutaciones impulsoras y otras alteraciones al ADN y al ARN en muchos c&aacute;nceres. Estudios que comparan la informaci&oacute;n gen&oacute;mica de tumores y de tejido normal del mismo paciente permiten a los investigadores descubrir cambios gen&oacute;micos&nbsp;que pueden impulsar el c&aacute;ncer.</p>
            <p>Otra oportunidad es extender el uso actual de los m&eacute;todos gen&oacute;micos para investigar la base molecular de fenotipos cl&iacute;nicos. Este m&eacute;todo podr&iacute;a ayudar a los investigadores a identificar los cambios gen&eacute;ticos que pueden distinguir a los c&aacute;nceres agresivos de los de crecimiento lento, por ejemplo. M&eacute;todos semejantes podr&iacute;an usarse para estudiar la base molecular de reacci&oacute;n a una determinada terapia, as&iacute; como mecanismos de resistencia a tratamiento.</p>
            <p>La riqueza de datos que emergen de los estudios del genoma de c&aacute;ncer se integrar&aacute;n cada vez m&aacute;s con los historiales m&eacute;dicos y datos cl&iacute;nicos de pacientes. Estos resultados integrados podr&iacute;an usarse para formular m&eacute;todos m&aacute;s afines para el diagn&oacute;stico y tratamiento del c&aacute;ncer, as&iacute; como para mejorar los m&eacute;todos de predicci&oacute;n de riesgo de c&aacute;ncer, pron&oacute;stico y reacci&oacute;n al tratamiento.</p>
            <p>Las herramientas gen&oacute;micas ser&aacute;n tambi&eacute;n esenciales para analizar resultados de estudios cl&iacute;nicos de medicina de precisi&oacute;n, como los que se llevan a cabo por la <a href="/espanol/investigacion/areas/estudios-clinicos/nctn" title="">Red Nacional de Estudios Cl&iacute;nicos&nbsp;del NCI</a>.</p>

            <p>Un an&aacute;lisis completo de los genomas del c&aacute;ncer ha revelado mucha diversidad en las anomal&iacute;as gen&eacute;ticas entre los c&aacute;nceres de un solo tipo. M&aacute;s a&uacute;n, las alteraciones gen&eacute;ticas recurrentes dentro de esos c&aacute;nceres est&aacute;n incluidas en solo un peque&ntilde;o porcentaje de casos. La identificaci&oacute;n de los&nbsp;cambios gen&eacute;ticos que&nbsp;inician la formaci&oacute;n de c&aacute;ncer y el descubrimiento de alteraciones gen&eacute;ticas&nbsp;raras que impulsan los c&aacute;nceres son, por lo tanto,&nbsp;un reto para el campo.&nbsp;</p>
            <p>Otro reto es la adquisici&oacute;n de muestras biol&oacute;gicas de alta calidad necesarias para estudios gen&oacute;micos, en particular para tipos de tumores que son poco comunes o raros, o los que no son tratados principalmente con cirug&iacute;a.</p>
            <p>La preparaci&oacute;n de estirpes celulares y de modelos animales que captan la diversidad del c&aacute;ncer humano es una necesidad insatisfecha. Los modelos de subtipos raros de c&aacute;ncer pueden no existir o tener muy poca representaci&oacute;n, y no&nbsp; hay modelos para muchas lesiones gen&eacute;ticas recurrentes en el c&aacute;ncer humano.</p>
            <p>El manejo y an&aacute;lisis de grandes cantidades de datos que comprenden los estudios gen&oacute;micos son desaf&iacute;os adicionales para el campo. Esta &aacute;rea de investigaci&oacute;n requiere una eficiente infraestructura de&nbsp;bioinform&aacute;tica e implica cada vez m&aacute;s contribuciones de datos y pericia de equipos interdisciplinarios.</p>

            <p>La búsqueda de los fundamentos genéticos del cáncer es una parte vital de los programas de investigación del NCI. En 2012, el NCI estableció un nuevo Centro para Genómica del Cáncer (CCG) para centrarse en el estudio de cómo los genes alterados promueven el cáncer. El CCG usa técnicas de alto rendimiento para identificar y estudiar mutaciones, grandes reordenaciones del genoma, aumentos y disminuciones en el número de copias del ADN, modificaciones químicas del ADN, así como cambios en la expresión de ARN y proteínas. El NCI apoya varios programas de investigación de genómica de cáncer y programas relacionados para traducir esos resultados en avances clínicos para pacientes.</p>

Los estudios del NCI usan com&uacute;nmente muchas t&eacute;cnicas gen&oacute;micas. La integraci&oacute;n de los resultados de varios an&aacute;lisis ayuda a los cient&iacute;ficos a obtener un mejor entendimiento del c&aacute;ncer, en forma parecida a la combinaci&oacute;n de las tintas de color magenta, azul y amarillo pueden generar impresos de colores vibrantes.</p>
