The identification of inherited susceptibility to ovarian/fallopian tube cancer may influence surgical treatment decisions.

Current treatment options for optimally resected stage III ovarian carcinoma include intravenous (IV) chemotherapy, dose-dense IV chemotherapy, and a combination of IV paclitaxel plus intraperitoneal (IP) cisplatin, followed by IP paclitaxel 1 week later.

These are two important but different concepts.  Relative risk (RR) refers to an estimate of risk relative to another group (e.g., risk of an outcome like breast cancer for women who are exposed to a risk factor <em>relative</em> to the risk of breast cancer for women who are unexposed to the same risk factor). RR measures that are greater than 1 mean that the risk for those captured in the numerator (i.e., the exposed) is higher than the risk for those captured in the denominator (i.e., the unexposed).  RR measures that are less than 1 mean that the risk for those captured in the numerator (i.e., the exposed) is lower than the risk for those captured in the denominator (i.e., the unexposed).  Measures with similar relative interpretations include the odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio, and risk ratio.</p><p id="_2760" tabindex="-1">Absolute risk measures take into account the number of people who have a particular outcome, the number of people in a population who could have the outcome, and person-time (the period of time during which an individual was at risk of having the outcome), and reflect the absolute burden of an outcome in a population.  Absolute measures include risks and rates and can be expressed over a specific time frame (e.g., 1 year, 5 years) or overall lifetime. Cumulative risk is a measure of risk that occurs over a defined time period.  For example, overall lifetime risk is a type of cumulative risk that is usually calculated on the basis of a given life expectancy (e.g., 80 or 90 years). Cumulative risk can also be presented over other time frames (e.g., up to age 50 years).</p><p id="_2761" tabindex="-1">Large relative risk measures do not mean that there will be large effects in the actual number of individuals at a population level because the disease outcome may be quite rare.  For example, the relative risk for smoking is much higher for lung cancer than for heart disease, but the absolute difference between smokers and nonsmokers is greater for heart disease, the more-common outcome, than for lung cancer, the more-rare outcome.</p><p id="_2762" tabindex="-1">Therefore, in evaluating the effect of exposures and biological markers on disease prevention across the continuum, it is important to recognize the differences between relative and absolute effects in weighing the overall impact of a given risk factor. For example, the magnitude is in the range of 30% (e.g., ORs or RRs of 1.3) for many breast cancer risk factors, which means that women with a risk factor (e.g., alcohol consumption, late age at first birth, oral contraceptive use, postmenopausal body size) have a 30% relative increase in breast cancer in comparison with what they would have if they did not have that risk factor.  But the absolute increase in risk is based on the underlying absolute risk of disease.  <a href="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq#link/_2922">Figure 5</a> and <a href="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq#link/_2822">Table 2</a>  show the impact of a relative risk factor in the range of 1.3 on absolute risk.

There is a special sense of urgency for carriers of <em>BRCA1</em> pathogenic variants, in whom cumulative lifetime risks of ovarian cancer may exceed 40%.</p><p id="_2204" tabindex="-1">Thus, it is expected that many new ovarian cancer biomarkers (either singly or in combination) will be proposed as ovarian cancer screening strategies during the next 5 to 10 years. While this is an active area of research with a number of promising new biomarkers in early development, <strong> at present, none of these biomarkers alone or in combination have been sufficiently well studied to justify their routine clinical use for screening purposes</strong>, either in the general population or in women at increased genetic risk.</p><p id="_2205" tabindex="-1">Before information related to emerging ovarian cancer biomarkers is addressed, it is important to consider the several steps that are required to develop and, more importantly, validate a new biomarker. One useful framework is that published by  the National Cancer Institute Early Detection Research Network investigators.<a href="#cit/section_7.152">152</a> They indicated that the goal of a cancer-screening program is to detect tumors at an early stage so that treatment is likely to be successful. The gold standard by which such programs are judged is whether the death rate from the cancer for which screening is performed is reduced among those being screened.  In addition, the screening test must be sufficiently noninvasive and inexpensive to allow widespread use in the population to be screened. Maintaining high test specificity (i.e., few false-positive results) is essential for a population screening test, because even a low false-positive rate results in many people having to undergo unnecessary and costly diagnostic procedures and psychological stress.  It is likely that the use of several such cancer biomarkers in combination will be required for a screening test to be both sensitive and specific.</p><p id="_2206" tabindex="-1">Furthermore, a clinically useful test must have a high PPV (a parameter derived from sensitivity, specificity, and disease prevalence in the screened population). Practically speaking, a biomarker with a PPV of  10% implies that ten surgical procedures would be required to identify one case of ovarian cancer; the remaining nine surgeries would represent false-positive test findings. In general, the ovarian cancer research community considers biomarkers with a PPV less than 10% to be clinically unacceptable, given the morbidity related to bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy.  Finally, it is important to keep in mind that while novel biomarkers may be present in the sera of women with advanced ovarian cancer (who represent most  cases analyzed in the early phases of biomarker development), they may or may not be detectable in women with early-stage disease, which is essential if the screening test is to be clinically useful.</p><p id="_2207" tabindex="-1">It has been suggested that there are five general phases in biomarker development and validation are currently suggested:</p><div class="pdq-content-list"><p class="pdq-list-title">Phase 1 &#x2014; Preclinical exploratory studies</p><ul id="_2208"><li>Identify potentially discriminating biomarkers.</li><li>Usually done by comparing gene over- or underexpression in the tumor compared with normal tissue.</li><li>Because many exploratory analyses in large numbers of genes are performed at this stage, one or more may seem to have good discriminating ability between cancers and normal tissue by random chance alone.</li></ul></div><div class="pdq-content-list"><p class="pdq-list-title">Phase 2 &#x2014; Clinical assay development for clinical disease</p><ul id="_2209"><li>Develop a clinical assay that can be obtained on noninvasively obtained samples (e.g., a blood specimen).</li><li>Often the test targets the protein product of one of the genes found to be of interest in phase 1.</li><li>The goal is to describe the performance characteristics of the assay for distinguishing between subjects with and without cancer.

In addition, the test must demonstrate clinical utility, that is, a positive net balance of benefits and risks associated with the application of the test. These may include improved health outcomes and net psychosocial and economic benefits.<a href="#cit/section_7.153">153</a></p><p id="_2214" tabindex="-1">Ovarian cancer poses a unique challenge relative to the potential impact of false-positive test results. There are no reliable noninvasive diagnostic tests for early-stage disease, and clinically significant early-stage cancer may not be grossly visible at the time of exploratory surgery.<a href="#cit/section_7.154">154</a>  Consequently, it is likely that some patients will be reassured that their abnormal test does not indicate the presence of cancer only by having their ovaries and fallopian tubes surgically removed and examined microscopically.
            High test specificity (i.e., a very low false-positive rate) is required to avoid unnecessary surgery and induction of premature menopause women with in false-positive results.

This has been implemented in the form of the risk of ovarian cancer algorithm (ROCA), an investigational statistical model that incorporates serial CA-125 test results and other covariates into a computation that produces an estimate of the likelihood that ovarian cancer is present in the screened subject. The first report of this strategy, based on reanalysis of 5,550 average-risk women from the Stockholm Ovarian Cancer screening trial,  suggested that ovarian cancer cases and controls could be distinguished with 99.7% sensitivity, 83% specificity, and a PPV of 16%. That PPV represents an eightfold increase over the 2% PPV reported with a single measure of CA-125.<a href="#cit/section_7.156">156</a> This report was followed by applying the ROCA to 33,621 serial CA-125 values obtained from the 9,233 average-risk postmenopausal women in a prospective British ovarian cancer screening trial.<a href="#cit/section_7.157">157</a> The area under the receiver operator curve increased from 84% to 93% (<em>P</em> = .01) for ROCA compared with a fixed CA-125 cutoff. These observations represented the first evidence that preclinical detection of ovarian cancer might be improved using this screening strategy. A prospective study of 13,000 normal volunteers aged 50 years and older in England used serial CA-125 values and the ROCA to stratify participants into low, intermediate, and elevated risk subgroups.<a href="#cit/section_7.158">158</a> Each had its own prescribed management strategy, including TVUS and repeat CA-125 either annually (low risk) or at 3 months (intermediate risk).

Optimal timing of RRSO must be individualized, but evaluating a woman's risk of ovarian cancer based on pathogenic variant status can be helpful in the decision-making process. In a large study of U.S. <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> families, age-specific cumulative risk of ovarian cancer at age 40 years was 4.7% for carriers of <em>BRCA1</em> pathogenic variants and 1.9% for carriers of <em>BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants.<a href="#cit/section_7.199">199</a> In a combined analysis of 22 studies of carriers of <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants, risk of ovarian cancer for carriers of <em>BRCA1</em> pathogenic variants increased most sharply from age 40 years  to age 50 years, while the risk for carriers of <em>BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants was low before age 50 years but increased sharply from age 50 years to age 60 years.<a href="#cit/section_7.200">200</a> In a population-based study of <em>BRCA</em> pathogenic variants in ovarian cancer patients, patients with <em>BRCA2</em> variants had a significantly later age of onset than patients with <em>BRCA1</em> variants (57.3 years [range, 40&#x2013;72] vs. 52.6 years [range, 31&#x2013;78]).<a href="#cit/section_7.201">201</a> In summary, women with <em>BRCA1</em> pathogenic variants may consider RRSO for ovarian cancer risk reduction at a somewhat earlier age than women with <em>BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants; however, women with <em>BRCA2</em> variants may still consider early RRSO for breast cancer risk reduction.</p><p id="_2688" tabindex="-1">The role of concomitant hysterectomy at the time of RRSO in carriers of <em>BRCA1/BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants is controversial. There is concern that a small portion of the proximal fallopian tube remains when hysterectomy is not performed, thereby resulting in a residual increased risk of fallopian tube cancer. However, several studies that have examined fallopian tube cancers indicate that the vast majority of these cancers occur in the distal or midportion of the fallopian tube, suggesting that the occurrence of proximal fallopian tube cancer would be a very unlikely event. Some reports have suggested an increased incidence of uterine carcinoma in carriers of pathogenic variants,<a href="#cit/section_7.202">202</a> whereas others have not confirmed an elevated risk of serous uterine cancer.<a href="#cit/section_7.203">203</a> A prospective study of 857 women suggested that any increased incidence of uterine cancer appeared to be among carriers of <em>BRCA1</em> pathogenic variants  who used tamoxifen;<a href="#cit/section_7.204">204</a> this was confirmed by the same group in a later study of 4,456 carriers of <em>BRCA1/BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants.<a href="#cit/section_7.205">205</a> Even with tamoxifen use, the excess risk of endometrial cancer was small, with a 10-year cumulative risk of 2%.<a href="#cit/section_7.205">205</a> In addition, the use of tamoxifen can now be minimized, given the options of raloxifene (which does not increase the risk of uterine cancer) and aromatase inhibitors for breast cancer prevention in postmenopausal women. Therefore, on the basis of the current understanding of the risk of uterine cancer in carriers of <em>BRCA</em> pathogenic variants, there is not a singularly compelling reason to consider hysterectomy at the time of RRSO to reduce the risk of uterine cancer.  Concomitant hysterectomy does offer the advantage of simplifying the hormone replacement regimen for carriers of <em>BRCA</em> pathogenic variants who choose to take hormones.  After hysterectomy, women can take estrogen alone (which does not increase the risk of breast cancer), without progestins, thereby eliminating the risk of postmenopausal bleeding.</p><p id="_2347" tabindex="-1">Studies indicate that removal of the uterus is not necessary as a risk-reducing procedure.

In counseling a carrier of a <em>BRCA</em> pathogenic variant about optimal risk-reducing surgical options, aggregate data suggest that the risk from residual tubal tissue after RRSO is the least compelling reason to suggest hysterectomy. Therefore, in the absence of tamoxifen use or other underlying uterine or cervical problems, hysterectomy is not a routine component of RRSO for <em>BRCA</em> carriers.</p><p id="_2243" tabindex="-1">For women who are premenopausal at the time of surgery, the symptoms of surgical menopause (e.g., hot flashes, mood swings, weight gain, and genitourinary complaints) can cause a significant impairment in their quality of life.

Use of the decision aid did not alter cancer risk management intentions and behaviors. Slightly detrimental effects on well-being and several decision-related outcomes, however, were noted among affected women.<a href="#cit/section_9.208">208</a>
            Another study compared responses to a tailored decision aid (including a values-clarification exercise) versus a general information pamphlet intended for women making decisions about ovarian cancer risk management.  In the short term, the women receiving the tailored decision aid showed a decrease in decisional conflict and increased knowledge compared with women receiving the pamphlet, but no differences in decisional outcomes were found between the two groups.  In addition, the decision aid did not appear to alter the participant&#x2019;s baseline cancer risk management decisions.<a href="#cit/section_9.207">207</a> A multisite randomized trial of 150 unaffected women with <em>BRCA1/BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants assessed the effect of a decision aid on breast cancer risk management decisions and psychosocial outcomes. At 6-month and 12-month follow-up, women randomly assigned to the decision aid had lower levels of cancer-related distress (<em>P</em> = .01 at 6 months and <em>P</em> = .05 at 12 months) than did the control group.<a href="#cit/section_9.210">210</a>  Decisional conflict scores were relatively low at baseline and declined over time in both groups; the scores between the two groups were not statistically different.</p></section><section id="_1519"><h4 id="_1519_toc">Uptake of cancer risk management options</h4><p id="_1506" tabindex="-1">An increasing number of studies have examined uptake and adherence to cancer risk management options among individuals who have undergone genetic counseling and testing for <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants.  Findings from these studies are reported in  <a href="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq#link/_2613">Table 16</a> and <a href="/types/breast/hp/breast-ovarian-genetics-pdq#link/_2614">Table 17</a>.  Outcomes vary across studies and include uptake or adherence to screening (mammography, magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], cancer antigen [CA] 125, transvaginal ultrasound [TVUS]) and  selection of RRM and RRSO. Studies generally report outcomes by pathogenic variant carrier or testing status (e.g., positive for pathogenic variants, negative for pathogenic variants, or declined genetic testing).  Follow-up time after notification of genetic risk status also varied across studies, ranging from 12 months up to several years.</p><p id="_1522" tabindex="-1">Findings from these studies suggest that breast screening often improves after notification of <em>BRCA1/BRCA2</em> pathogenic variant carrier status; nonetheless, screening remains suboptimal.  Fewer studies have examined adoption of MRI as a screening modality, probably due to the recent availability of efficacy data.  Screening for ovarian cancer varied widely across studies, and also varied based on type of screening test (i.e., CA-125 serum testing vs. TVUS screening).  However, ovarian cancer screening does not appear to be widely adopted by carriers of <em>BRCA1/BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants.  Uptake of RRM varied widely across studies, and may be influenced by personal factors (such as younger age or having a family history of breast cancer), psychosocial factors (such as a desire for reduction of cancer-related distress), recommendations of the health care provider, and cultural or health care system factors. An individual&#x2019;s choice to have a bilateral mastectomy also appears to be influenced by pretreatment genetic education and counseling regardless of the genetic test results.<a href="#cit/section_9.211">211</a> Similarly, uptake of RRSO also varied across studies, and may be influenced by similar factors, including older age, personal history of breast cancer, perceived risk of ovarian cancer, cultural factors (i.e., country), and the recommendations of the health care provider.</p><table id="_2613" class="table-default expandable-container"><caption>Table 16.

Twice as many women with bilateral mastectomy made negative and mixed comments than did women with contralateral mastectomy. The areas of most concern were body image, problems with breast implants, pain after surgery, and sexuality. The authors proposed that those who had undergone contralateral procedures had already been treated for cancer, while those who had undergone bilateral procedures had not been treated previously, and this may partially account for the differences in satisfaction between the two groups.

The 30% of subjects reporting vaginal dryness and dyspareunia were more likely to report dissatisfaction with the procedure. </p><p id="_2419" tabindex="-1">A Canadian prospective study examined the impact of RRSO on menopausal symptoms and sexual functioning before surgery and then 1 year later in a sample of 114 women with known <em>BRCA1/BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants.<a href="#cit/section_9.268">268</a>  Satisfaction with the decision to undergo RRSO was high regardless of symptoms reported.  Those who were premenopausal at the time of surgery (n = 75) experienced a worsening of symptoms and a decline in sexual functioning.  HRT addressed vaginal dryness and dyspareunia but not declines in sexual pleasure.  HRT also resulted in fewer moderate to severe hot flashes.   </p><p id="_1625" tabindex="-1">Additional work reported by this group found that the majority of the 127 women who had undergone RRSO 1 year previously (75 with <em>BRCA1</em> pathogenic variants; 52 with <em>BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants) felt that RRSO reduced their risk of both breast and ovarian cancer.<a href="#cit/section_9.269">269</a>  There was a wide range of risk perceptions for ovarian cancer noted in the group.  Twenty percent of carriers of <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants thought that their risk of ovarian cancer was completely eliminated; others had an inflated perception of their ovarian cancer risk both before and after surgery.  A small group of these women were further surveyed at about 3 years postsurgery, and their risk perceptions did not change significantly during this extended time period. These findings suggest that important misperceptions about ovarian cancer risk may persist after RRSO. Additional genetic education and counseling may be warranted.</p><p id="_1046" tabindex="-1">A larger study assessed quality of life in women at high risk of ovarian cancer who opted for periodic gynecologic screening (GS) versus those who underwent RRSO.  Eight hundred forty-six high-risk women, 44% of whom underwent RRSO and 56% of whom chose GS, completed questionnaires evaluating quality of life, cancer-specific distress, endocrine symptoms, and sexual functioning.<a href="#cit/section_9.270">270</a>  Women in the RRSO group were a mean of 2.8 &#xB1;1.9 years from surgery and women in the GS group were a mean of 4.3 years from their first visit to a gynecologist for high-risk management. No statistical difference in overall quality of life was detected between the RRSO and GS groups.  When compared with the GS group, women who underwent RRSO had poorer sexual functioning and more endocrine symptoms such as vaginal dryness, dyspareunia, and hot flashes.  Women who underwent RRSO experienced lower levels of breast and ovarian cancer distress and had a more favorable perception of cancer risk.</p><p id="_2420" tabindex="-1">Women (N = 182) at risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer  referred for genetic counseling were surveyed concerning their satisfaction with their choice of either RRSO or periodic screening (PS) (biannual pelvic examination with TVUS and CA-125 determination) to manage their ovarian cancer risk.<a href="#cit/section_9.271">271</a>  Overall satisfaction with both options was extremely high, but highest among those who chose RRSO over PS.  There were no other demographic or clinical factors that distinguished satisfaction level. There was higher decisional ambivalence among those who chose PS.</p><p id="_2386" tabindex="-1">A retrospective study assessed 98 carriers of <em>BRCA</em> pathogenic variants who underwent  RRSO about their preoperative counseling regarding symptoms to expect  after surgery.<a href="#cit/section_9.272">272</a> The mean age at RRSO was 45.5 years (range, ages 32&#x2013;63 years). Eighty-five percent pursued RRSO after learning that they harbored a <em>BRCA</em> pathogenic variant, and 48.0% were premenopausal at the time of surgery. Participants reported  &#x2018;&#x2018;frequent&#x2019;&#x2019; or &#x2018;&#x2018;very frequent&#x2019;&#x2019; postsurgical symptoms of vaginal dryness (52.1%), changes in interest in sex (50.0%), sleep disturbances (46.7%), changes in sex life (43.9%), and hot flashes (42.9%). Only vaginal dryness and hot flashes were commonly recalled to have been addressed preoperatively. While 96% would have the surgery again, participants reported that the discussion of the impact of surgery on their sex life (59.2%), risk of coronary heart disease (57.1%), and the availability of sex counseling (57.1%) would have been helpful. </p></section></section><section id="_332"><h3 id="_332_toc">Behavioral Outcomes</h3><p id="_333" tabindex="-1">A study <a href="#cit/section_9.273">273</a> of screening behaviors of 216 self-referred, high-risk (&gt;10% risk of carrying a <em>BRCA1/BRCA2</em> pathogenic variant) women who are members of hereditary breast cancer families found a range of screening practices.  Even the  presence of known pathogenic variants in their families was not associated with good adherence to recommended screening practices.  Sixty-nine percent of women aged 50 to 64 years and 83% of women aged 40 to 49 years had had a screening mammogram in the previous year.  Twenty percent of participants had ever had a CA-125 test and 31% had ever had a pelvic ultrasound or TVUS. Further analysis of this study population <a href="#cit/section_9.273">273</a> looking specifically at 107 women with informative <em>BRCA</em> test results found good use of breast cancer screening, though the uptake rate in younger carriers is lower. The reason for the lower uptake rate was not explored in this study.<a href="#cit/section_9.274">274</a> One survey of screening behaviors among women at increased risk of breast/ovarian cancer identified physician recommendations as a significant factor in adherence to screening.<a href="#cit/section_9.275">275</a> </p><p id="_1021" tabindex="-1">While motivations cited for pursuing genetic testing often include the expectation that carriers of pathogenic variants will be more compliant with breast and/or ovarian screening recommendations,<a href="#cit/section_9.273">273</a><a href="#cit/section_9.276">276</a><a href="#cit/section_9.277">277</a><a href="#cit/section_9.278">278</a> limited data exist about whether participants in genetic testing alter their screening behaviors over time and about other variables that may influence those behaviors, such as insurance coverage and physician recommendations or attitudes.
            The impact of cancer genetic counseling on screening behaviors was assessed in a U.K. study of 293 women followed for 12 months postcounseling at  four cancer genetics clinics.<a href="#cit/section_9.279">279</a> BSE, CBE, and mammography were significantly increased after counseling; however, gaps in adherence to recommendations were noted: 38% of women aged 35 to 49 years had not had a mammogram by 12 months postcounseling. BSE was not done by most women at the recommended time and frequency. </p><p id="_334" tabindex="-1">This is a critical issue not only for women testing positive, but also for
            adherence to screening for those testing negative and those who have
            received <a class="definition" type="GlossaryTermRefs" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=556497&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000556497&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic'); return(false);">indeterminate</a> results or choose not to receive their results.  It is
            possible that adherence actually diminishes with a decrease in the perceived
            risk that may result from a negative genetic test result.
            </p><p id="_335" tabindex="-1">In addition, while there is still some question regarding the link between
            cancer-related worry and breast cancer screening behavior, accumulating
            evidence appears to support a linear rather than a curvilinear relationship.
            That is, for some time, the data were not consistent; some data supported the
            hypothesis that mild-to-moderate worry may increase adherence, while excessive
            worry may actually decrease the utilization of recommended screening practices.
            Other reports support the notion that a linear relationship is more likely;
            that is, more worry increases adherence to screening recommendations.  Few
            studies, however,  have followed women to assess their health behaviors
            after genetic testing.  Thus, a negative test result leading to decreased
            worry could theoretically result in decreased screening adherence.  A large study found that patient compliance with screening practices was not related to general or screening-specific anxiety&#x2014;with the exception of BSE, for which compliance is negatively associated with procedure-specific anxiety.<a href="#cit/section_9.72">72</a> Further
            research designed to clarify this potential concern would highlight the need
            for comprehensive genetic counseling to discuss the need for follow-up
            screening.
            </p><p id="_336" tabindex="-1">Further complicating this area of research are issues such as the baseline rate
            of mammography adherence among women older than 40 or 50 years before genetic
            testing.  More specifically, the ability to note a significant difference in
            adherence on this measure may be affected by the high adherence rate to this
            screening behavior before genetic testing by women undergoing such testing.   It
            may be easier to find significant changes in mammography use among women with a
            family history of breast cancer who test positive.  Finally, adherence over
            time will likely be affected by how women undergoing genetic
            testing and their caregivers perceive the efficacy of many of the screening options
            in question, such as mammography for younger women, BSE,
            and ovarian cancer screening (periodic vaginal ultrasound and serum CA-125
            measurements), along with the value of preventive interventions.</p><p id="_337" tabindex="-1">The issue of screening decision-making and adherence among women undergoing
            genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer is the subject of several ongoing
            trials, and an area of much needed ongoing study. </p></section><h6 do-not-show="toc">References</h6><ol><li id="section_9.1">Ropka ME, Wenzel J, Phillips EK, et al.: Uptake rates for breast cancer genetic testing: a systematic review.

Clinical management based on knowledge of inherited pathogenic variants is emerging. <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_1324">Factors suggestive of a genetic contribution to prostate cancer</a> include the following: 1) multiple affected first-degree relatives (FDRs) with prostate cancer, including three successive generations with prostate cancer in the maternal or paternal lineage; 2) early-onset prostate cancer (age &#x2264;55 years); and 3) prostate cancer with a family history of other cancers (e.g., breast, ovarian, pancreatic).</p></li><li><strong>Associated Genes and Single-Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs)</strong><p id="_1395" tabindex="-1">Several genes and chromosomal regions have been found to be associated with prostate cancer in various <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_28">linkage analyses</a>, <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_917">case-control studies</a>, <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_513">genome-wide association studies (GWAS)</a>, and <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_684">admixture mapping studies</a>. Pathogenic variants in genes of high and moderate penetrance, such as <em><a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_1051">BRCA1</a></em>, <em><a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_1051">BRCA2</a></em>, the <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_947">mismatch repair genes</a>, and <em><a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_948">HOXB13</a></em>  confer modest to high lifetime risk of prostate cancer. Some, such as <em>BRCA2</em>, have emerging clinical relevance in the treatment and screening for  prostate cancer. In addition, GWAS have identified more than 100 SNPs associated with the development of prostate cancer, but the clinical utility of these findings remains uncertain. Studies are ongoing to assess whether combinations of these SNPs may have clinical relevance in identifying individuals at increased risk of the disease. Studies analyzing the <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_645">association between variants and aggressive disease</a> are also ongoing.</p></li><li><strong>Clinical Management</strong><p id="_1396" tabindex="-1">Information is limited about the efficacy of commonly available screening tests such as the digital rectal exam and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels in men genetically predisposed to developing prostate cancer. Initial reports of targeted PSA <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_1254">screening of carriers of BRCA pathogenic variants</a> has yielded a higher proportion of aggressive disease. On the basis of the available data, most professional societies and organizations recommend that high-risk men engage in shared decision-making with their health care providers and develop individualized plans for prostate cancer screening based on their risk factors. For example, some experts suggest initiating prostate cancer screening at age 45 years in carriers of <em>BRCA2</em> pathogenic variants and consideration of screening in <em>BRCA1</em> carriers. Inherited variants may influence treatment decisions, particularly for males with pathogenic variants in DNA repair genes. Studies have reported improved response rates to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibition among males with metastatic, castrate-resistant prostate cancer carrying germline pathogenic variants in <em>BRCA2</em> and other DNA repair genes.</p></li><li><strong>Psychosocial and Behavioral Issues</strong><p id="_1397" tabindex="-1"><a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_76">Psychosocial research</a> in men at increased hereditary risk of prostate cancer has focused on <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_251">risk perception</a>, <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_80">interest in genetic testing</a>, and <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_95">screening behaviors</a>.  Study conclusions vary regarding whether FDRs of prostate cancer patients accurately estimate their prostate cancer risk, with some studies reporting that men with a family history of prostate cancer consider their risk to be the same as or less than that of the average man. Factors such as being married and the confusion between benign prostatic hyperplasia and prostate cancer have been found to influence perceived risk of prostate cancer. Studies conducted before the availability of genetic testing for prostate cancer susceptibility showed that factors found to positively influence men&#x2019;s hypothetical interest in genetic testing included the advice of their primary care physician, a combination of the emotional distress and concern about prostate cancer treatment effects, and having children. Several small studies have examined the behavioral correlates of prostate cancer screening at average and increased prostate cancer risk based on family history; in general, results appear contradictory regarding whether men with a family history are more likely to be screened than those not at risk and whether the screening is appropriate for their risk status. Research is ongoing to better understand and address psychosocial and behavioral issues in high-risk families.</p></li></ul></div></div>

A total of 164,690 new cases of prostate cancer and 29,430 deaths from the disease are anticipated in the United States in 2018, making it the most frequent nondermatologic cancer among U.S. males.<a href="#cit/section_2.1">1</a>  A man&#x2019;s lifetime risk of prostate cancer is one in nine. Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men, exceeded only by lung cancer.<a href="#cit/section_2.1">1</a></p><p id="_3" tabindex="-1">Some men with prostate cancer remain asymptomatic and die from unrelated causes rather than as a result of the cancer itself. This may be due to the advanced age of many men at the time of diagnosis, slow tumor growth, or response to therapy.<a href="#cit/section_2.2">2</a>  The estimated number of men with latent prostate carcinoma (i.e., prostate cancer that is present in the prostate gland but never detected or diagnosed during a patient&#x2019;s life) is greater than the number of men with clinically detected disease.  A better understanding is needed of the genetic and biologic mechanisms that determine why some prostate carcinomas remain clinically silent, while others cause serious, even life-threatening illness.<a href="#cit/section_2.2">2</a> </p><p id="_350" tabindex="-1">Prostate cancer exhibits tremendous differences in incidence among populations worldwide; the ratio of countries with high and low rates of prostate cancer ranges from 60-fold to 100-fold.<a href="#cit/section_2.3">3</a> Asian men typically have a very low incidence of prostate cancer, with age-adjusted incidence rates ranging from 2 to 10 cases per 100,000 men.  Higher incidence rates are  generally observed in northern European countries.  African American men, however, have the highest incidence of prostate cancer in the world; within the United States, African American men have a 60% higher incidence rate than white  men.<a href="#cit/section_2.4">4</a>  African American men have been reported to have more than twice the rate of prostate cancer&#x2013;specific death compared with non-Hispanic white men.<a href="#cit/section_2.1">1</a> Differences in race-specific prostate cancer survival estimates may be narrowing over time.<a href="#cit/section_2.5">5</a></p><p id="_4" tabindex="-1">These differences may be due to the interplay of genetic, environmental, and social influences (such as access to health care), which may affect the development and progression of the disease.<a href="#cit/section_2.6">6</a> Differences in <a class="definition" type="GlossaryTermRefs" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=46171&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046171&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic'); return(false);">screening</a> practices have also had a substantial influence on prostate cancer incidence, by permitting prostate cancer to be diagnosed in some patients before symptoms develop or before abnormalities on physical examination are detectable.  An analysis of population-based data from Sweden suggested that a diagnosis of prostate cancer in one brother leads to an early diagnosis in a second brother using prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening.<a href="#cit/section_2.7">7</a> This may account for an increase in prostate cancer diagnosed in younger men that was evident in nationwide incidence data. A genetic contribution to prostate cancer risk has been documented, and there is increasing knowledge of the molecular genetics of the disease, although much of what is known is not yet clinically actionable.  Malignant transformation of prostate epithelial cells and progression of prostate carcinoma are likely to  result from a complex series of initiation and promotional events under both genetic and environmental influences.<a href="#cit/section_2.8">8</a> </p><section id="_5"><h3 id="_5_toc">Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer</h3><p id="_6" tabindex="-1">The three most important recognized risk factors for prostate cancer in the United States are:</p><div class="pdq-content-list"><ul id="_7"><li><a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_1176">Age</a>.</li><li><a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_1178">Ancestry</a>.</li><li><a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_13">Family history of prostate cancer</a>.</li></ul></div><section id="_1176"><h4 id="_1176_toc">Age</h4><p id="_1177" tabindex="-1">Age is an important risk factor for prostate cancer.

Thus, men who do not inherit the prostate cancer susceptibility gene that is segregating in their family may still develop prostate cancer, obscuring the genetic signal.  There are no clinical or pathological features of prostate cancer that will allow differentiation between inherited and sporadic forms of the disease, although current advances in the understanding of molecular phenotypes of prostate cancer may be informative in identifying inherited prostate cancer. Similarly, there are limited data regarding the clinical phenotype or natural history of prostate cancer associated with specific candidate loci. Measurement of the serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) has been used inconsistently in evaluating families used in linkage analysis studies of prostate cancer.  In linkage studies, the

Linkage analyses are designed to uncover rare, highly penetrant variants that segregate in predictable heritance patterns (e.g., <a class="definition" type="GlossaryTermRefs" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339338&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000339338&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic'); return(false);">autosomal dominant</a>, <a class="definition" type="GlossaryTermRefs" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339339&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000339339&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic'); return(false);">autosomal recessive</a>, X-linked, and mitochondrial).

Most genetic polymorphisms genotyped in GWAS are common, with minor allele frequencies greater than 1% to 5% within a given ancestral population (e.g., men of European ancestry).

Other approaches include evaluating SNPs implicated in a phenotype other than prostate cancer.<a href="#cit/section_3.137">137</a><a href="#cit/section_3.138">138</a></p></section><section id="_856"><h4 id="_856_toc">Conclusions</h4><p id="_857" tabindex="-1">Although the statistical evidence for an association between genetic variation at these loci and prostate cancer risk is overwhelming, the clinical relevance of the variants and the mechanism(s) by which they lead to increased risk are unclear and will require further characterization. Additionally, these loci are associated with very modest risk estimates and explain only a fraction of overall inherited risk. Further work will include genome-wide analysis of rarer alleles catalogued via sequencing efforts, such as the 1000 Genomes Project.<a href="#cit/section_3.139">139</a> Disease-associated alleles with frequencies of less than 1% in the population may prove to be more highly penetrant and clinically useful. In addition, further work is needed to describe the landscape of genetic risk in non-European populations. Finally, until the individual and collective influences of genetic risk alleles are evaluated prospectively, their clinical utility will remain difficult to fully assess.</p></section></section><section id="_645"><h3 id="_645_toc">Inherited Variants Associated With Prostate Cancer Aggressiveness</h3><p id="_1422" tabindex="-1">Prostate cancer is biologically and clinically heterogeneous. Many tumors are indolent and are successfully managed with observation alone. Other tumors are quite aggressive and prove deadly. Several variables are used to determine prostate cancer aggressiveness at the time of diagnosis, such as Gleason score and PSA, but these are imperfect. Additional markers are needed because sound treatment decisions depend on accurate prognostic information. Germline genetic variants are attractive markers because they are present, easily detectable, and static throughout life. </p><p id="_1423" tabindex="-1">Findings to date regarding inherited risk of aggressive disease are considered preliminary. As described below, germline SNPs associated with prostate cancer aggressiveness are derived primarily from three methods of analysis: 1) annotation of common variants within candidate risk genes; 2) assessment of known overall prostate cancer risk SNPs for aggressiveness; and 3) GWAS for prostate cancer aggressiveness. Further work is needed to validate findings and assess these associations prospectively.</p><p id="_1424" tabindex="-1">Like studies of the genetics of overall prostate cancer risk, initial studies of inherited risk of aggressive prostate cancer focused on polymorphisms in candidate genes.<a href="#cit/section_3.68">68</a><a href="#cit/section_3.140">140</a><a href="#cit/section_3.141">141</a><a href="#cit/section_3.142">142</a><a href="#cit/section_3.143">143</a><a href="#cit/section_3.144">144</a><a href="#cit/section_3.145">145</a> Next, as GWAS revealed prostate cancer risk SNPs, several research teams sought to determine whether certain overall risk SNPs were also associated with aggressiveness.<a href="#cit/section_3.146">146</a><a href="#cit/section_3.147">147</a><a href="#cit/section_3.148">148</a><a href="#cit/section_3.149">149</a><a href="#cit/section_3.150">150</a><a href="#cit/section_3.151">151</a><a href="#cit/section_3.152">152</a><a href="#cit/section_3.153">153</a>
            </p><p id="_1425" tabindex="-1">There has been great interest in launching more unbiased, genome-wide searches for inherited variants associated with indolent versus aggressive prostate cancer.</p><p id="_1439" tabindex="-1">Associations between inherited variants and prostate cancer aggressiveness have been reported. A multistage, case-only GWAS led by the National Cancer Institute examined 12,518 prostate cancer cases and discovered an association between genotype and Gleason score at two polymorphisms: rs35148638 at 5q14.3 (<em>RASA1</em>, <em>P</em> = 6.49 &#xD7; 10<span class="sup">-9</span>) and rs78943174 at 3q26.31 (<em>NAALADL2</em>, <em>P</em> = 4.18 &#xD7; 10<span class="sup">-8</span>).<a href="#cit/section_3.154">154</a> Although the associations discovered in this trial may provide valuable insight into the biology of high-grade disease, it is unclear whether they will prove clinically useful. This study raises the issue of the definition of &#x201C;prostate cancer aggressiveness.&#x201D; Gleason score is used as a prognostic marker but is not a perfect surrogate for prostate cancer&#x2013;specific survival or overall survival.</p><p id="_1426" tabindex="-1">A few GWAS designed specifically to focus on prostate cancer subjects with documented disease-related outcomes have been launched. In one study&#x2014;a genome-wide analysis in which two of the largest international prostate cancer genotyped cohorts were combined for analysis (24,023 prostate cancer cases, including 3,513 disease-specific deaths)&#x2014;no SNP was significantly associated with prostate cancer&#x2013;specific survival.<a href="#cit/section_3.155">155</a>
            Similarly, in a smaller study assessing prostate cancer&#x2013;specific mortality (196 lethal cases, 368 long-term survivors), no variants were significantly associated with outcome.<a href="#cit/section_3.156">156</a> More recently, a GWAS was conducted across 24,023 prostate cancer patients and similarly found no significant association between genetic variants and prostate cancer survival.<a href="#cit/section_3.154">154</a> The authors of these studies concluded that any SNP associated with prostate cancer outcome must be fairly rare in the general population (minor allele frequency below 1%). </p></section><h6 do-not-show="toc">References</h6><ol><li id="section_3.1">Easton DF, Schaid DJ, Whittemore AS, et al.: Where are the prostate cancer genes?--A summary of eight genome wide searches.

The cumulative risk to age 70 years was estimated to be 16% (95% CI, 4&#x2013;30) among carriers of the founder pathogenic variants and 3.8% among noncarriers (95% CI, 3.3&#x2013;4.4).<a href="#cit/section_4.15">15</a>  This fourfold increase in prostate cancer risk was equal (in absolute terms) to the cumulative risk of ovarian cancer among female carriers at the same age (16% by age 70 years; 95% CI, 6&#x2013;28).  The risk of prostate cancer in male carriers in the WAS cohort was elevated by age 50 years, was statistically significantly elevated by age 67 years, and increased thereafter with age, suggesting both an overall excess in prostate cancer risk and an earlier age at diagnosis among carriers of Ashkenazi  founder pathogenic variants. Prostate cancer risk differed depending on the gene, with <em>BRCA1</em> pathogenic variants associated with increasing risk after age 55 to 60 years, reaching 25% by age 70 years and 41% by age 80 years. In contrast, prostate cancer risk associated with the <em>BRCA2</em> pathogenic variant began to rise at later ages, reaching 5% by age 70 years and 36% by age 80 years (numeric values were provided by the author [written communication, April 2005]).</p><p id="_915" tabindex="-1">The studies summarized in <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_1121">Table 4</a> used similar case-control methods to examine the prevalence of Ashkenazi founder pathogenic variants among Jewish men with prostate cancer and found an overall positive association between carrier status of founder pathogenic variants and prostate cancer risk.</p><table id="_1121" class="table-default expandable-container"><caption>Table 4.

Because awareness of a positive family history can lead to more frequent work-ups for cancer and result in apparently earlier prostate cancer detection, assessments of disease progression rates and survival after diagnosis are subject to selection, lead time, and length biases. (Refer to the PDQ  <a href="/about-cancer/screening/hp-screening-overview-pdq">Cancer Screening Overview</a> summary for more information.)  This section focuses on screening and risk reduction of prostate cancer among men predisposed to the disease; data relevant to screening in high-risk men are primarily extracted from studies performed in the general population.</p></section><section id="_1251"><h3 id="_1251_toc">Screening</h3><p id="_1252" tabindex="-1">Information is limited about the efficacy of commonly available screening tests such as the digital rectal exam (DRE) and serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in men <a class="definition" type="GlossaryTermRefs" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460153&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000460153&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic'); return(false);">genetically predisposed</a> to developing prostate cancer.

In addition, there is little evidence to support specific screening approaches in prostate cancer families at high risk.

In addition to site-specific prostate cancer, other cancer susceptibility syndromes include prostate cancer as a component tumor (e.g.,  hereditary breast/ovarian cancer syndrome [associated with <a class="definition" type="GlossaryTermRefs" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=783960&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000783960&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic'); return(false);">pathogenic variants</a> in <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>]).</li><li>Assessment for genetic transmission.  The pedigree should be assessed for evidence of both autosomal dominant and <a class="definition" type="GlossaryTermRefs" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=339348&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000339348&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic'); return(false);">X-linked inheritance</a>, which may be associated with a higher likelihood of an inherited susceptibility to prostate cancer.  Autosomal dominant transmission is characterized by the presence of affected family members in sequential generations, with approximately 50% of males in each generation affected with prostate cancer.  X-linked inheritance is suggested by apparent transmission of susceptibility from affected males in the maternal lineage. (Refer to the <a href="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/risk-assessment-pdq#link/_174">Analysis of the Family History</a>  section in the PDQ summary on <a href="/about-cancer/causes-prevention/genetics/risk-assessment-pdq">Cancer Genetics Risk Assessment and Counseling</a> for more information.)</li><li>Age at diagnosis of prostate cancer in the family.  An inherited susceptibility to prostate cancer may be likely in families with early-onset (inconsistently defined) prostate cancer.<a href="#cit/section_6.12">12</a>  However, genetic research is also under way in families with an older age of prostate cancer onset.  In the aggregate, the data are inconsistent relative to whether hereditary prostate cancer is routinely characterized by a younger-than-usual age at diagnosis.</li><li><a class="definition" type="GlossaryTermRefs" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=460214&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000460214&amp;version=healthprofessional&amp;language=English&amp;dictionary=genetic'); return(false);">Risk assessment</a> based on family and epidemiological studies.  Multiple studies have reported that first-degree relatives of men affected with prostate cancer are two to three times more likely to develop prostate cancer than are men in the general population.  In some studies, the relative risk (RR) of prostate cancer is highest among families who develop prostate cancer at an earlier age, consistent with other cancer susceptibility syndromes  in which early age at onset is a common feature.  It has been estimated that male relatives of men diagnosed with prostate cancer younger than  53 years have a 40% lifetime cumulative risk of developing prostate cancer.<a href="#cit/section_6.13">13</a>  A population-based case-control study of more than 1,500 cases and 1,600 controls, in which whites, African Americans, and Asian Americans were studied, reported an odds ratio of 2.5 for men with an affected first-degree relative after adjusting for age and ethnicity.<a href="#cit/section_6.14">14</a>  For men with a brother and father or son affected with prostate cancer, the RR was estimated to be 6.4.</li></ol></div><p id="_296" tabindex="-1">A number of studies have examined the accuracy of the family history of prostate cancer provided by men with prostate cancer. This has clinical importance when risk assessments are based on unverified family history information. In an Australian study of 154 unaffected men with a family history of prostate cancer, self-reported family history was verified from cancer registry data in 89.6% of cases.<a href="#cit/section_6.15">15</a> Accuracy of age at diagnosis within a 3-year range was correct in 83% of the cases, and accuracy of age at diagnosis within a 5-year range was correct in 93% of the cases. Self-reported family history from men younger than 55 years and reports about first-degree relatives had the highest degree of accuracy.<a href="#cit/section_6.15">15</a> Self-reported family history of prostate cancer, however, may not be reliably reported over time,<a href="#cit/section_6.16">16</a> which underscores the need to verify objectively reported prostate cancer diagnoses when trying to determine whether a patient has a significant family history.</p><p id="_297" tabindex="-1">The personal health and risk-factor history includes,  but is not limited to, the following:</p><div class="pdq-content-list"><ul id="_381"><li>Family history.</li><li><a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_5">Age</a>.</li><li><a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_5">Race</a>.</li><li>Current and past diet history, including fat intake.</li><li>Current and past use of drugs that can affect prostatic growth, such as steroids (e.g., finasteride [Proscar]).

Despite this limitation, cancer risk counseling is an educational  process that provides details regarding the state of the knowledge of prostate cancer risk factors.  The discussion regarding these other risk factors should be individualized to incorporate the patient's personal health and risk factor history.  (Refer to the <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_5">Risk Factors for Prostate Cancer</a> section of this summary for  a more detailed description of prostate cancer risk factors.)</p><p id="_299" tabindex="-1">The psychosocial assessment in this context might include evaluation of the following:</p><div class="pdq-content-list"><ul id="_306"><li>Level of psychological distress.</li><li>Perceived risk of prostate cancer.</li><li>Past history of depression, anxiety, or other mental illness.</li></ul></div><p id="_300" tabindex="-1">One study found that psychological distress was greater among men attending prostate cancer screening who had a family history of the disease, particularly if they also reported an overestimation of prostate cancer risk.

These findings must be interpreted cautiously in predicting actual prostate cancer genetic test uptake once testing is available. In both Huntington disease and hereditary breast and ovarian cancers, hypothetical interest before testing was possible was much higher than actual uptake following availability of the test.<a href="#cit/section_7.24">24</a><a href="#cit/section_7.25">25</a></p><p id="_1285" tabindex="-1">In a sample comprised of undiagnosed men  with and without a prostate cancer&#x2013;affected FDR, older age and lower education levels were associated with lower levels of prostate cancer&#x2013;specific distress (as measured by the 11-item Prostate Cancer Anxiety Subscale of the Memorial Anxiety Scale for Prostate Cancer); higher distress was associated with having more urinary symptoms.<a href="#cit/section_7.26">26</a> In the same study, men with a prostate cancer&#x2013;affected FDR who perceived their relative&#x2019;s cancer as more threatening and who had a relative deceased from the disease reported higher distress. In general, prostate cancer&#x2013;specific distress levels were low for both groups of men. </p></section><section id="_95"><h3 id="_95_toc">Screening for Prostate Cancer in Individuals at Increased Familial Risk</h3><p id="_176" tabindex="-1">The proportion of prostate cancers attributed to hereditary causes is estimated to be 5% to 10%,<a href="#cit/section_7.27">27</a> and the risk of prostate cancer  increases with the number of blood relatives with prostate cancer and young age at onset of prostate cancer within families.<a href="#cit/section_7.28">28</a> There is considerable controversy in prostate cancer about the use of serum prostate-specific antigen (PSA) measurement and digital rectal exam for prostate cancer early detection in the general population, with different organizations suggesting significantly different screening algorithms and age recommendations. (Refer to the PDQ summary on <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-treatment-pdq">Prostate Cancer Treatment</a>  for more information about prostate cancer in the general population and the <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_62">Interventions</a> section of this summary for more information about inherited prostate cancer susceptibility.) This variation is likely to add to patient and provider confusion about recommendations for screening by members of hereditary cancer families or FDRs of prostate cancer patients. Psychosocial questions of interest include what individuals at increased risk understand about hereditary risk, whether informational interventions are associated with increased uptake of prostate cancer screening behaviors, and what the associated quality-of-life implications of screening are for individuals at increased risk. Also of interest is the role of the primary care provider in helping those at increased risk identify their risk and undergo age- and family-history&#x2013;appropriate screening. </p><section id="_181"><h4 id="_181_toc">Screening behaviors</h4><p id="_182" tabindex="-1">In most cancers, the goal of improved knowledge of hereditary risk can be translated rather easily into a desired increase in adherence to approved and recommended (if not proven) screening behaviors. This is complicated for prostate cancer screening by the lack of clear recommendations for men in both high-risk and general populations. (Refer to the <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_1251">Screening</a> section of this summary for more information.) In addition, controversy exists with regard to the value of early diagnosis of prostate cancer. This creates uncertainty for patients and providers and challenges the psychosocial factors related to screening behavior.</p><p id="_456" tabindex="-1">Several small studies have examined the behavioral correlates of prostate cancer screening at average and increased prostate cancer risk based on family history; these are summarized in <a href="/types/prostate/hp/prostate-genetics-pdq#link/_458">Table 13</a>. In general, results appear contradictory regarding whether men with a family history are more likely to be screened than those not at risk and whether the screening is appropriate for their risk status.  Furthermore, most of the studies had relatively small numbers of subjects, and the criteria for screening were not uniform, making generalization difficult.</p><table id="_458" class="table-default expandable-container"><caption>Table 13.

and 28% said it affected their daily life "slightly."<a href="#cit/section_7.3">3</a></p><p id="_186" tabindex="-1"><strong>Baseline distress levels:</strong>  Among men who self-referred for free prostate cancer screening, general and prostate cancer&#x2013;related distress did not differ significantly between men who were  FDRs of prostate cancer patients and men who were not.<a href="#cit/section_7.37">37</a> Men with a family history of prostate cancer in the study had higher levels of perceived risk. In a Swedish study, male  FDRs of prostate cancer patients who reported more worry about developing prostate cancer had higher Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS) depression and anxiety scores than men with lower levels of worry. In that study, the average HADS depression and anxiety scores among  FDRs was at the 75<span class="sup">th</span> percentile. Depression was associated with higher levels of personal risk overestimation.<a href="#cit/section_7.3">3</a></p><p id="_187" tabindex="-1"><strong>Distress experienced during prostate cancer screening:</strong> A study measured the anxiety and general quality of life experienced by 220 men with a family history of prostate cancer while undergoing prostate cancer screening with PSA tests.<a href="#cit/section_7.32">32</a> In this group, 20% of the men experienced a moderate deterioration in their anxiety scores, and 20% experienced a minimal deterioration in health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The average period between assessments was 35 days, which encompassed PSA testing and a wait for results that averaged 15.6 days. Only men with normal PSA values (4 ng/mL or less) were assessed.  Factors associated with deterioration in HRQOL included being  age 50 to  60 years, having more than two relatives with prostate cancer, having an anxious personality, being well-educated, and having no children presently living at home. These authors stress that analysis of the impact of screening on  FDRs should not rely solely on mean changes in scores, which may &#x201C;mask diversity among responses, as illustrated by the proportion of subjects worsening during the screening process.&#x201D; Given that these were men receiving what was considered a normal result and that a subset of men experienced screening-associated distress, this study suggests that interventions to reduce screening-related distress may be needed to encourage men at increased hereditary risk to comply with repeated requests for screening.</p><p id="_409" tabindex="-1">A study in the United Kingdom assessed predictors of psychological morbidity and screening adherence in  FDRs of men with prostate cancer participating in a PSA screening study.  One hundred twenty-eight  FDRs completed measures assessing psychological morbidity, barriers, benefits, knowledge of PSA screening, and perceived susceptibility to prostate cancer.  Overall, 18 men (14%) scored above the threshold for psychiatric morbidity, consistent with normal population ranges.  Cancer worry was positively associated with health anxiety, perceived risk, and subjective stress. However, psychological morbidity did not predict PSA screening adherence. Only past screening behavior was found to be associated with PSA screening adherence.<a href="#cit/section_7.38">38</a></p></section></section><h6 do-not-show="toc">References</h6><ol><li id="section_7.1">Weinrich SP, Weinrich MC, Boyd MD, et al.: The impact of prostate cancer knowledge on cancer screening.
