        <p>It is both an honor and a privilege to be given the opportunity to once again serve as acting director of the National Cancer Institute, following the departure of Dr. Ned Sharpless, who has been asked by the administration to serve as acting commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.</p>
        <p>As his deputy, it was a pleasure to work closely with Ned, and I wish him the very best in his new role. I also feel the cancer research community owes him an enormous debt of gratitude for his exemplary leadership of NCI over the past year and a half, and for the course he&rsquo;s set during this time of extraordinary interest and progress in cancer research.</p>
        <p>I agree with Ned that NCI&rsquo;s greatest strength is the passionate, talented people who work here. The challenges and opportunities before us are many, and I know I can count on NCI&rsquo;s exceptionally talented leaders and staff to continue their commitment and passion for our shared mission. In the months ahead, rest assured that I&mdash;and everyone at NCI&mdash;will remain focused on supporting the very best science in pursuit of better understanding the causes of cancer and its pathogenesis, and improving our ability to prevent, diagnose, and treat it.</p>
        <p>Bipartisan support for biomedical research and substantial budget increases in each of the past 5 years have contributed to greater progress against cancer. However, there is still much to be done.</p>
        <p>Last week, I had the opportunity to join with NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins and other NIH leaders in <span><a href="https://appropriations.house.gov/legislation/hearings/national-institutes-of-health-budget-request-for-fy-2020">representing NCI before the House subcommittee that oversees appropriations for NIH</a></span>. It was gratifying to speak with the committee about some of the research NCI is supporting, to hear from the committee members about their keen interest in the research that NIH funds in their communities and elsewhere, and to learn about their commitment to NIH.</p>
        <p>I look forward to sharing with you, via this blog and other forums, more about how NCI is helping to shape and nurture a vibrant cancer research community to better prevent and treat cancer in service to patients everywhere.</p>

      <p>A global resource that includes data on thousands of inherited variants in the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genes is available to the public. The BRCA Exchange was created through the BRCA Challenge, a long-term&nbsp;demonstration project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to enhance sharing of <em>BRCA1 </em>and<em> BRCA2</em> data. The resource, available through a website and a new <a href="https://brcaexchange.org/about/app">smartphone app</a>, allows clinicians to review expert classifications of variants in these major cancer predisposition genes as part of their individual assessment of complex questions related to cancer prevention, screening, and intervention for high-risk patients.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>The five-year BRCA Challenge project was funded in part by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and through the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative">Cancer Moonshot</a><span>℠</span>. A paper detailing the development of the BRCA Exchange was published January 8, 2019, in&nbsp;<em>PLOS Genetics</em>.</p>
      <p>“This project has yielded a meta-analysis of <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2 </em>variants collected from multiple sources to understand how experts annotate specific mutations in the two genes,” said Stephen J. Chanock, M.D., director of NCI’s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and lead author of the paper. “There’s an urgent need for sharing data in cancer predisposition research. The BRCA Exchange is proof of principle that large-scale collaboration and data sharing can be achieved and can provide the latest and best quality information to enable clinicians and individuals to improve care.”</p>

      <p>Certain inherited variants in these genes can increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers by varying degrees, whereas others are not associated with disease. Clinicians and patients need to know whether a given variant is likely to be disease-associated (pathogenic) and how likely a pathogenic variant is to cause cancer (penetrance). Until now, the available data on the inherited variants in these genes were not aggregated in a comprehensive way.</p>
      <p>The BRCA Exchange dataset is composed of information from existing clinical databases—the Breast Cancer Information Core, ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database—as well as population databases and data from clinicians, clinical laboratories, and researchers worldwide. It currently includes more than 20,000 unique <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> variants. More than 6,100 variants in the database have been classified by an expert panel, the Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles, and approximately 3,700 of these variants are known to cause disease. The BRCA Exchange pools variants from data resources worldwide, which should lead to inclusion of rare variants that are very occasionally observed.</p>
      <p>With a single-point-of-access website (<a href="http://www.brcaexchange.org">www.brcaexchange.org</a>), the BRCA Exchange provides information on these gene variants to clinicians, researchers, data scientists, patients, and patient advocates. It also serves as a demonstration project showing that this kind of comprehensive data sharing—requiring collaboration across hundreds of organizations, the establishment of an infrastructure to house the information, and the development of data-sharing protocols—is possible for other cancer predisposition genes and, indeed, for genes associated with other diseases.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Next steps for the project include collaboration with additional global data generators and data holders, continued technical development, and increased engagement with patients and patient advocates around the world.</p>

            <p>Many women who have a mastectomy—surgery to remove an entire breast to treat or prevent breast cancer—have the option of having the shape of the removed breast rebuilt.</p>
            <p>Women who choose to have their breasts rebuilt have several options for how it can be done. Breasts can be rebuilt using implants (saline or silicone). They can also be rebuilt using autologous tissue (that is, tissue from elsewhere in the body). Sometimes both implants and autologous tissue are used to rebuild the breast.</p>
            <p><a href="https://public.govdelivery.com/accounts/USNIHNCI/subscriber/new"> <span>GovDelivery Test Link</span></a></p>
            <p>Surgery to reconstruct the breasts can be done (or started) at the time of the mastectomy (which is called immediate reconstruction) or it can be done after the mastectomy incisions have healed and breast cancer therapy has been completed (which is called delayed reconstruction). Delayed reconstruction can happen months or even years after the mastectomy.</p>
            <p>In a final stage of breast reconstruction, a nipple and areola may be re-created on the reconstructed breast, if these were not preserved during the mastectomy.</p>
            <p>Sometimes breast reconstruction surgery includes surgery on the other, or contralateral, breast so that the two breasts will match in size and shape.</p>

            <p>Implants are inserted underneath the skin or chest muscle following the mastectomy. (Most mastectomies are performed using a technique called skin-sparing mastectomy, in which much of the breast skin is saved for use in reconstructing the breast.)</p>
            <p>Implants are usually placed as part of a two-stage procedure.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the first stage, the surgeon places a device, called a tissue expander, under the skin that is left after the mastectomy or under the chest muscle (1,2). The expander is slowly filled with saline during periodic visits to the doctor after surgery.</li>
              <li>In the second stage, after the chest tissue has relaxed and healed enough, the expander is removed and replaced with an implant. The chest tissue is usually ready for the implant 2 to 6 months after mastectomy.</li>
              <li>In some cases, the implant can be placed in the breast during the same surgery as the mastectomy—that is, a tissue expander is not used to prepare for the implant (3).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Surgeons are increasingly using material called acellular dermal matrix as a kind of scaffold or “sling” to support tissue expanders and implants. Acellular dermal matrix is a kind of mesh that is made from donated human or pig skin that has been sterilized and processed to remove all cells to eliminate the risks of rejection and infection.</p>

            <p>In autologous tissue reconstruction, a piece of tissue containing skin, fat, blood vessels, and sometimes muscle is taken from elsewhere in a woman’s body and used to rebuild the breast. This piece of tissue is called a flap.</p>
            <p>Different sites in the body can provide flaps for breast reconstruction. Flaps used for breast reconstruction most often come from the abdomen or back. However, they can also be taken from the thigh or buttocks.</p>
            <p>Depending on their source, flaps can be pedicled or free.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>With a pedicled flap, the tissue and attached blood vessels are moved together through the body to the breast area. Because the blood supply to the tissue used for reconstruction is left intact, blood vessels do not need to be reconnected once the tissue is moved.</li>
              <li>With free flaps, the tissue is cut free from its blood supply. It must be attached to new blood vessels in the breast area, using a technique called microsurgery. This gives the reconstructed breast a blood supply.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Abdominal and back flaps include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>DIEP flap: Tissue comes from the abdomen and contains only skin, blood vessels, and fat, without the underlying muscle. This type of flap is a free flap.</li>
              <li>Latissimus dorsi (LD) flap: Tissue comes from the middle and side of the back. This type of flap is pedicled when used for breast reconstruction. (LD flaps can be used for other types of reconstruction as well.)</li>
              <li>SIEA flap (also called SIEP flap): Tissue comes from the abdomen as in a DIEP flap but includes a different set of blood vessels. It also does not involve cutting of the abdominal muscle and is a free flap. This type of flap is not an option for many women because the necessary blood vessels are not adequate or do not exist.</li>
              <li>TRAM flap: Tissue comes from the lower abdomen as in a DIEP flap but includes muscle. It can be either pedicled or free.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Flaps taken from the thigh or buttocks are used for women who have had previous major abdominal surgery or who don’t have enough abdominal tissue to reconstruct a breast. These types of flaps are free flaps. With these flaps an implant is often used as well to provide sufficient breast volume.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>IGAP flap: Tissue comes from the buttocks and contains only skin, blood vessels, and fat.</li>
              <li>PAP flap: Tissue, without muscle, that comes from the upper inner thigh.</li>
              <li>SGAP flap: Tissue comes from the buttocks as in an IGAP flap, but includes a different set of blood vessels and contains only skin, blood vessels, and fat.</li>
              <li>TUG flap: Tissue, including muscle, that comes from the upper inner thigh.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In some cases, an implant and autologous tissue are used together. For example, autologous tissue may be used to cover an implant when there isn’t enough skin and muscle left after mastectomy to allow for expansion and use of an implant (1,2).</p>

            <p>Many women who have a mastectomy—surgery to remove an entire breast to treat or prevent breast cancer—have the option of having the shape of the removed breast rebuilt.</p>
            <p>Women who choose to have their breasts rebuilt have several options for how it can be done. Breasts can be rebuilt using implants (saline or silicone). They can also be rebuilt using autologous tissue (that is, tissue from elsewhere in the body). Sometimes both implants and autologous tissue are used to rebuild the breast.</p>
            <p>Surgery to reconstruct the breasts can be done (or started) at the time of the mastectomy (which is called immediate reconstruction) or it can be done after the mastectomy incisions have healed and breast cancer therapy has been completed (which is called delayed reconstruction). Delayed reconstruction can happen months or even years after the mastectomy.</p>
            <p>In a final stage of breast reconstruction, a nipple and areola may be re-created on the reconstructed breast, if these were not preserved during the mastectomy.</p>
            <p>Sometimes breast reconstruction surgery includes surgery on the other, or contralateral, breast so that the two breasts will match in size and shape.</p>

            <p>Implants are inserted underneath the skin or chest muscle following the mastectomy. (Most mastectomies are performed using a technique called skin-sparing mastectomy, in which much of the breast skin is saved for use in reconstructing the breast.)</p>
            <p>Implants are usually placed as part of a two-stage procedure.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>In the first stage, the surgeon places a device, called a tissue expander, under the skin that is left after the mastectomy or under the chest muscle (1,2). The expander is slowly filled with saline during periodic visits to the doctor after surgery.</li>
              <li>In the second stage, after the chest tissue has relaxed and healed enough, the expander is removed and replaced with an implant. The chest tissue is usually ready for the implant 2 to 6 months after mastectomy.</li>
              <li>In some cases, the implant can be placed in the breast during the same surgery as the mastectomy—that is, a tissue expander is not used to prepare for the implant (3).</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Surgeons are increasingly using material called acellular dermal matrix as a kind of scaffold or “sling” to support tissue expanders and implants. Acellular dermal matrix is a kind of mesh that is made from donated human or pig skin that has been sterilized and processed to remove all cells to eliminate the risks of rejection and infection.</p>

            <p>In autologous tissue reconstruction, a piece of tissue containing skin, fat, blood vessels, and sometimes muscle is taken from elsewhere in a woman’s body and used to rebuild the breast. This piece of tissue is called a flap.</p>
            <p>Different sites in the body can provide flaps for breast reconstruction. Flaps used for breast reconstruction most often come from the abdomen or back. However, they can also be taken from the thigh or buttocks.</p>
            <p>Depending on their source, flaps can be pedicled or free.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>With a pedicled flap, the tissue and attached blood vessels are moved together through the body to the breast area. Because the blood supply to the tissue used for reconstruction is left intact, blood vessels do not need to be reconnected once the tissue is moved.</li>
              <li>With free flaps, the tissue is cut free from its blood supply. It must be attached to new blood vessels in the breast area, using a technique called microsurgery. This gives the reconstructed breast a blood supply.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Abdominal and back flaps include:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>DIEP flap: Tissue comes from the abdomen and contains only skin, blood vessels, and fat, without the underlying muscle. This type of flap is a free flap.</li>
              <li>Latissimus dorsi (LD) flap: Tissue comes from the middle and side of the back. This type of flap is pedicled when used for breast reconstruction. (LD flaps can be used for other types of reconstruction as well.)</li>
              <li>SIEA flap (also called SIEP flap): Tissue comes from the abdomen as in a DIEP flap but includes a different set of blood vessels. It also does not involve cutting of the abdominal muscle and is a free flap. This type of flap is not an option for many women because the necessary blood vessels are not adequate or do not exist.</li>
              <li>TRAM flap: Tissue comes from the lower abdomen as in a DIEP flap but includes muscle. It can be either pedicled or free.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Flaps taken from the thigh or buttocks are used for women who have had previous major abdominal surgery or who don’t have enough abdominal tissue to reconstruct a breast. These types of flaps are free flaps. With these flaps an implant is often used as well to provide sufficient breast volume.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>IGAP flap: Tissue comes from the buttocks and contains only skin, blood vessels, and fat.</li>
              <li>PAP flap: Tissue, without muscle, that comes from the upper inner thigh.</li>
              <li>SGAP flap: Tissue comes from the buttocks as in an IGAP flap, but includes a different set of blood vessels and contains only skin, blood vessels, and fat.</li>
              <li>TUG flap: Tissue, including muscle, that comes from the upper inner thigh.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In some cases, an implant and autologous tissue are used together. For example, autologous tissue may be used to cover an implant when there isn’t enough skin and muscle left after mastectomy to allow for expansion and use of an implant (1,2).</p>

            <p>There are several main <a href="/types" data-custom-link="CustomLinksTest|Cancer Types">types of cancer</a>. Carcinoma is a cancer that begins in the skin or in tissues that line or cover internal organs. Sarcoma is a cancer that begins in bone, cartilage, fat, muscle, blood vessels, or other connective or supportive tissue. Leukemia is a cancer that starts in blood-forming tissue, such as the bone marrow, and causes large numbers of abnormal blood cells to be produced and enter the blood. Lymphoma and multiple myeloma are cancers that begin in the cells of the immune system. Central nervous system cancers are cancers that begin in the tissues of the brain and spinal cord. Also called malignancy.</p>

            <p>Cancer <a href="/about-cancer" data-custom-link="PreventionLink_Test|Prevention">prevention</a> is a critical component of our effort to reduce the burden of cancer in the United States and globally. As a measure of its importance, cancer prevention has the potential, in the long run, to save even more lives than treatment.
            <p>“It is <a href="#" data-custom-link>important</a> to recognize that cancer mortality rates are declining in the 20-to-49-year-old age group, and that the rates of decline among women in this age group are faster than those in older women,” said Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., acting director of NCI.
            The authors also reported in the special section that the incidence rates of in situ breast cancer and nonmalignant central nervous system tumors among women and men ages 20 to 49 are substantial. They wrote that some of the most frequent malignant and nonmalignant tumors that occur in this age group may be associated with considerable long-term and late effects related to the disease or its treatment. The authors conclude that access to timely and high-quality treatment and survivorship care is important to improve health outcomes and quality of life for younger adults diagnosed with cancer.</p>
            <p>Effective <a href="https://prevention.cancer.gov" data-custom-link="CustomLinksTest">prevention</a> will also reduce cancer incidence and morbidity, meaning fewer people will have to face the physical, financial, social, and psychological harms of a cancer diagnosis and treatment.</p>

            <p>One approach to cancer prevention is reducing or eliminating exposures to cancer-causing substances in the environment, such as asbestos, tobacco smoke, and radon gas. Another approach is to protect the body against such exposures or reduce their effect. For example, using sun screen to protect the skin against ultraviolet radiation and getting vaccinated against cancer-causing viruses, including certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) that cause cervical and several other types of cancer, can protect against processes that can eventually lead to cancer. In addition, some cancer screening tests, such as the Pap smear for cervical cancer and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer, can aid in cancer prevention. These tests detect premalignant lesions that can be removed or destroyed before they progress to cancer.</p>

            <p>SEER has developed  <i>Did You Know?</i> video series, in collaboration with NCI's Office of Communications & Public Liaison, to highlight key topics and trends in cancer statistics. Many of the statistics presented in the videos are available in the annual SEER Cancer Statistics Review (CSR). This video series explores three cancer patients&rsquo; and their doctor&rsquo;s thoughts and feelings about prognosis.&nbsp;</span>The videos explain key points about prognosis and how doctors and patients can talk about it in a clear and supportive way. Two viewer guides are also available: for <a href="/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/prognosis/patient-viewer-guide.pdf" title="">patients</a> (PDF-210KB) and for <a href="/about-cancer/diagnosis-staging/prognosis/provider-viewer-guide.pdf" title="">provider</a> care teams (PDF-210KB).</p>

            <p>Cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, as well as cancers that affect the bone marrow, can cause anemia. When you are anemic, your body does not have enough red blood cells. Red blood cells are the cells that that carry oxygen from the lungs throughout your body to help it work properly.</p>
            <p>You will have blood tests to check for anemia. Treatment for anemia is also based on your symptoms and on what is causing the anemia.</p>

            <p>As the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971, hard-fought and hard-won funding for cancer research began to effect true change. Ground broke, laboratories filled, and our nation's scientific workforce dedicated themselves to a new challenge of transforming how we understand and manage cancer. What we didn't know then is that these investments in the name of cancer would be crucial for our nation to fight future epidemics. The act inadvertently prepared our nation for another deadly illness that was yet to make its ominous appearance.</p>
            <p>In 1981, 10 years after the signing of the act, the NIH Clinical Center admit­ted one of the very first patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). He was admitted through an NCI branch that studied immunodeficiency diseases and the cancers afflicting patients with these diseases. Almost immediately after the recognition of AIDS as a new disease, it became apparent that patients with this puzzling syndrome often developed a previously rare cancer called Kaposi sarcoma as well as other tumors such as high-grade B-cell lymphomas. As a result, some of the earliest AIDS patient care and research was performed by NCI scientists and external researchers funded by NCI.</p>
            <p>AIDS researcher and early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug developer Robert Yarchoan, M.D., recalled the gravity of the moment: “AIDS showed us that something that no one ever worried about before suddenly could become a major problem for the country and for mankind. And when HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS, it became apparent that in addition to persons known to have AIDS, thousands of people in the United States were already infected with this new virus without knowing it. Moreover, at this time, infection with HIV was in most cases fatal.”</p>
            <p>As a result of the investment in cancer research stemming from the National Cancer Act, by the early 1980s NCI was in a strong position to make key early advances in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In particular, NCI and NCI-funded scientists had distinct expertise in retrovirology, in part because of the NCI Special Virus Cancer Program. NCI also had strong programs in immunology and drug development. With these areas of expertise, NCI scientists co-discovered HIV, showed that it was the cause of AIDS, developed the first blood test to prevent the spread of HIV by blood transfusion, and developed the first effective drugs to treat HIV including azidothymidine (also called AZT or zidovudine).</p>
            <p>Over the years, NCI developed an extensive portfolio of research in the cancers associated with HIV/AIDS as well as HIV/AIDS itself, and it was recognized that there was a need for a central office to coordinate and prioritize this research. In 2007, NCI, under the leadership of Dr. John Niederhuber, established the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM) under the Direction of Dr. Yarchoan. The creation of this office was pivotal to NCI. NCI currently funds both intramural (within NCI buildings) and extramural (through grants and contracts) research in HIV/AIDS and HIV-associated malignancies. In addition to coordinating HIV/AIDS and HIV- malignancy research throughout NCI, OHAM directly manages and facilitates major programs and initiatives through research, training, international studies, and clinical trials. As the needs and opportunities for research change, NCI’s OHAM plays a crucial role in prioritizing the most important research to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV-associated malignancies and other cancers in people living with HIV, as well as basic research on these cancers and HIV/AIDS itself.</p>
            <p>“Coordinating HIV/AIDS research throughout NCI, with the NIH Office of AIDS Research, and with other institutes and centers is a challenging task. However, doing it well enables us to make sure that funds are directed into the areas where they are most needed,” said RaeJean Hermansen, Ph.D., special assistant to the director of OHAM.</p>
            <p>Two of the main efforts overseen by OHAM are the AIDS Malignancy Consortium, which conducts clinical research in HIV-associated malignancies both in the United States and in resource-poor areas, including sub-Saharan Africa, and the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource, which helps researchers by coordinating tissue donations from patients with HIV/AIDS. “It is very gratifying to have contributed to managing vital programs that focus on improving the standard of care of people living with HIV and cancer and ease their sufferings,” said Mostafa Nokta, M.D., Ph.D., director, AIDS Cancer Clinical Program, OHAM, NCI.</p>
            <p>One of the challenges of OHAM is to adjust research priorities as needs and opportunities change. “With the development of antiretroviral therapy, we initially saw a dramatic decrease in AIDS-defining cancers. However, as people living with HIV are surviving and aging, we are seeing an increase in other cancers, and cancer continues to be a significant morbidity and one of the most frequent causes of death,” said Geraldina Dominguez, Ph.D., director, AIDS Malignancy Program, OHAM.</p>
            <p>The National Cancer Act paved the way for the resources, skills, and expertise to be in place for those at the forefront of HIV/AIDS research. It enabled major advances in a time of need and NCI looks forward to robust cross-fertilization between cancer research and HIV/AIDS research until we have addressed every challenge that comes our way.</p>

            <p>Although many doubted whether any drug could be developed to fight AIDS, Dr. Robert Yarchoan worked with Drs. Samuel Broder and Hiroaki Mitsuya on the first AIDS drugs, including azidothymidine (AZT), transforming a fatal disease into a chronic one.</p>

            <p>As the National Cancer Act was passed in 1971, hard-fought and hard-won funding for cancer research began to effect true change. Ground broke, laboratories filled, and our nation's scientific workforce dedicated themselves to a new challenge of transforming how we understand and manage cancer. What we didn't know then is that these investments in the name of cancer would be crucial for our nation to fight future epidemics. The act inadvertently prepared our nation for another deadly illness that was yet to make its ominous appearance.</p>
            <p>In 1981, 10 years after the signing of the act, the NIH Clinical Center admit­ted one of the very first patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). He was admitted through an NCI branch that studied immunodeficiency diseases and the cancers afflicting patients with these diseases. Almost immediately after the recognition of AIDS as a new disease, it became apparent that patients with this puzzling syndrome often developed a previously rare cancer called Kaposi sarcoma as well as other tumors such as high-grade B-cell lymphomas. As a result, some of the earliest AIDS patient care and research was performed by NCI scientists and external researchers funded by NCI.</p>
            <p>AIDS researcher and early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) drug developer Robert Yarchoan, M.D., recalled the gravity of the moment: “AIDS showed us that something that no one ever worried about before suddenly could become a major problem for the country and for mankind. And when HIV was identified as the cause of AIDS, it became apparent that in addition to persons known to have AIDS, thousands of people in the United States were already infected with this new virus without knowing it. Moreover, at this time, infection with HIV was in most cases fatal.”</p>
            <p>As a result of the investment in cancer research stemming from the National Cancer Act, by the early 1980s NCI was in a strong position to make key early advances in the fight against HIV/AIDS. In particular, NCI and NCI-funded scientists had distinct expertise in retrovirology, in part because of the NCI Special Virus Cancer Program. NCI also had strong programs in immunology and drug development. With these areas of expertise, NCI scientists co-discovered HIV, showed that it was the cause of AIDS, developed the first blood test to prevent the spread of HIV by blood transfusion, and developed the first effective drugs to treat HIV including azidothymidine (also called AZT or zidovudine).</p>
            <p>Over the years, NCI developed an extensive portfolio of research in the cancers associated with HIV/AIDS as well as HIV/AIDS itself, and it was recognized that there was a need for a central office to coordinate and prioritize this research. In 2007, NCI, under the leadership of Dr. John Niederhuber, established the Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy (OHAM) under the Direction of Dr. Yarchoan. The creation of this office was pivotal to NCI. NCI currently funds both intramural (within NCI buildings) and extramural (through grants and contracts) research in HIV/AIDS and HIV-associated malignancies. In addition to coordinating HIV/AIDS and HIV- malignancy research throughout NCI, OHAM directly manages and facilitates major programs and initiatives through research, training, international studies, and clinical trials. As the needs and opportunities for research change, NCI’s OHAM plays a crucial role in prioritizing the most important research to prevent, diagnose, and treat HIV-associated malignancies and other cancers in people living with HIV, as well as basic research on these cancers and HIV/AIDS itself.</p>
            <p>“Coordinating HIV/AIDS research throughout NCI, with the NIH Office of AIDS Research, and with other institutes and centers is a challenging task. However, doing it well enables us to make sure that funds are directed into the areas where they are most needed,” said RaeJean Hermansen, Ph.D., special assistant to the director of OHAM.</p>
            <p>Two of the main efforts overseen by OHAM are the AIDS Malignancy Consortium, which conducts clinical research in HIV-associated malignancies both in the United States and in resource-poor areas, including sub-Saharan Africa, and the AIDS and Cancer Specimen Resource, which helps researchers by coordinating tissue donations from patients with HIV/AIDS. “It is very gratifying to have contributed to managing vital programs that focus on improving the standard of care of people living with HIV and cancer and ease their sufferings,” said Mostafa Nokta, M.D., Ph.D., director, AIDS Cancer Clinical Program, OHAM, NCI.</p>
            <p>One of the challenges of OHAM is to adjust research priorities as needs and opportunities change. “With the development of antiretroviral therapy, we initially saw a dramatic decrease in AIDS-defining cancers. However, as people living with HIV are surviving and aging, we are seeing an increase in other cancers, and cancer continues to be a significant morbidity and one of the most frequent causes of death,” said Geraldina Dominguez, Ph.D., director, AIDS Malignancy Program, OHAM.</p>
            <p>The National Cancer Act paved the way for the resources, skills, and expertise to be in place for those at the forefront of HIV/AIDS research. It enabled major advances in a time of need and NCI looks forward to robust cross-fertilization between cancer research and HIV/AIDS research until we have addressed every challenge that comes our way.</p>
            <p>Although many doubted whether any drug could be developed to fight AIDS, Dr. Robert Yarchoan worked with Drs. Samuel Broder and Hiroaki Mitsuya on the first AIDS drugs, including azidothymidine (AZT), transforming a fatal disease into a chronic one.</p>

        <p>Getting a diagnosis and undergoing treatment for a serious illness like cancer rank as some of life’s most stressful experiences. Over the last decade, it’s been increasingly recognized that distress can have an impact on a patient's health. Asking people with cancer about their emotional health—and treating distress—has become an integral part of cancer care.</p>
        <p>But another population can experience substantial distress stemming from the fallout of a cancer diagnosis: family members and loved ones who act as caregivers. </p>
        <p>And progress in identifying caregivers in distress and pointing them toward help lags far behind the advances in helping patients, according to results from a new study published September 21 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.</p>
        <p>In a survey of more than 100 community cancer clinics across the United States, only 16% reported that they routinely screened caregivers for distress, and less than 13% had a strategy in place to refer those in need to mental health and other services, the study showed. In contrast, more than 90% regularly screened patients for distress and provided referrals to supportive care services.</p>
        <p>Distress can harm a caregiver’s mental and physical health and may also affect the loved one with cancer they’re caring for, explained Chandylen Nightingale, Ph.D., of Wake Forest University, who led the study.</p>
        <p>“There’s definitely evidence to suggest that caregiver well-being impacts the ability of people to provide care for their loved ones,” Dr. Nightingale said. “It can impact how well the person with cancer will do emotionally. It can even lead to them having more emergency room visits or longer hospital stays.”</p>
        <p>The good news is that systems already exist to capture information on distress for patients. It may just be a question of leveraging them to help caregivers, explained Ann Geiger, Ph.D., from NCI’s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), who was not involved with the study.</p>
        <p>“It is a major accomplishment that almost all patients are screened for distress. But it took a long time to get there—it’s not something that happened overnight,” Dr. Geiger explained.</p>
        <p>“Getting to widespread screening of caregivers will take time, but this research shows that process has begun.”</p>
        <h2>Many sources of distress for cancer caregivers</h2>

        <p>Caregiver distress, which may include symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, can arise from many stressors, explained Dr. Nightingale. </p>
        <p>“Cancer is often a very abrupt diagnosis and so, oftentimes, caregivers come into the role with little or no preparation or training. That can absolutely be distressing for them,” she said. “Then watching your loved one struggle with cancer treatment and any symptoms they might have, whether they’re physical or emotional, that’s going to be distressing.” </p>
        <p>Many caregivers also have to juggle their own challenges, such as a job and childcare, in addition to caretaking, explained Michelle Mollica, Ph.D., of DCCPS, who was also not involved in the study. </p>
        <p>“There’s so much uncertainty in cancer, and that often transfers to the caregiver,” Dr. Mollica said. “What will your partner or loved one need at any given moment? And how does that impact you and your ability to do things like work or take care of yourself, your finances?”</p>
        <p>Services exist to help caregivers deal with or lessen their distress, including referring people to mental health care or a formal support group, or providing help accessing financial resources. But caregiver programs are not universally availableExit Disclaimer, and how often caregivers in need get linked to such services isn’t well documented.</p>

        <p>Getting a diagnosis and undergoing treatment for a serious illness like cancer rank as some of life’s most stressful experiences. Over the last decade, it’s been increasingly recognized that distress can have an impact on a patient's health. Asking people with cancer about their emotional health—and treating distress—has become an integral part of cancer care.</p>
        <p>But another population can experience substantial distress stemming from the fallout of a cancer diagnosis: family members and loved ones who act as caregivers. </p>
        <p>And progress in identifying caregivers in distress and pointing them toward help lags far behind the advances in helping patients, according to results from a new study published September 21 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.</p>
        <p>In a survey of more than 100 community cancer clinics across the United States, only 16% reported that they routinely screened caregivers for distress, and less than 13% had a strategy in place to refer those in need to mental health and other services, the study showed. In contrast, more than 90% regularly screened patients for distress and provided referrals to supportive care services.</p>
        <p>Distress can harm a caregiver’s mental and physical health and may also affect the loved one with cancer they’re caring for, explained Chandylen Nightingale, Ph.D., of Wake Forest University, who led the study.</p>
        <p>“There’s definitely evidence to suggest that caregiver well-being impacts the ability of people to provide care for their loved ones,” Dr. Nightingale said. “It can impact how well the person with cancer will do emotionally. It can even lead to them having more emergency room visits or longer hospital stays.”</p>
        <p>The good news is that systems already exist to capture information on distress for patients. It may just be a question of leveraging them to help caregivers, explained Ann Geiger, Ph.D., from NCI’s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), who was not involved with the study.</p>
        <p>“It is a major accomplishment that almost all patients are screened for distress. But it took a long time to get there—it’s not something that happened overnight,” Dr. Geiger explained.</p>
        <p>“Getting to widespread screening of caregivers will take time, but this research shows that process has begun.”</p>
        <h2>Many sources of distress for cancer caregivers</h2>
        <p>Caregiver distress, which may include symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress, can arise from many stressors, explained Dr. Nightingale. </p>
        <p>“Cancer is often a very abrupt diagnosis and so, oftentimes, caregivers come into the role with little or no preparation or training. That can absolutely be distressing for them,” she said. “Then watching your loved one struggle with cancer treatment and any symptoms they might have, whether they’re physical or emotional, that’s going to be distressing.” </p>
        <p>Many caregivers also have to juggle their own challenges, such as a job and childcare, in addition to caretaking, explained Michelle Mollica, Ph.D., of DCCPS, who was also not involved in the study. </p>
        <p>“There’s so much uncertainty in cancer, and that often transfers to the caregiver,” Dr. Mollica said. “What will your partner or loved one need at any given moment? And how does that impact you and your ability to do things like work or take care of yourself, your finances?”</p>
        <p>Services exist to help caregivers deal with or lessen their distress, including referring people to mental health care or a formal support group, or providing help accessing financial resources. But caregiver programs are not universally availableExit Disclaimer, and how often caregivers in need get linked to such services isn’t well documented.</p>

      <p>Improvements in cancer prevention and screening have averted more deaths from five cancer types combined over the past 45 years than treatment advances, according to a modeling study led by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study, published Dec. 5, 2024, in JAMA Oncology, looked at deaths from breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer that were averted by the combination of prevention, screening, and treatment advancesExit Disclaimer. The researchers from NIH’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) focused on these five cancers because they are among the most common causes of cancer deaths and strategies exist for their prevention, early detection, and/or treatment. In recent years, these five cancers have made up nearly half of all new cancer diagnoses and deaths.</p>
      <p>"Although many people may believe that treatment advances are the major driver of reductions in mortality from these five cancers combined, the surprise here is how much prevention and screening contribute to reductions in mortality," said co-lead investigator Katrina A. B. Goddard, Ph.D., director of NCI’s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences. “Eight out of 10 deaths from these five cancers that were averted over the past 45 years were due to advances in prevention and screening.”</p>
      <p>A single prevention intervention, smoking cessation, contributed the lion’s share of the deaths averted: 3.45 million from lung cancer alone. When considering each cancer site individually, prevention and screening accounted for most deaths averted for cervical, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer, whereas treatment advances accounted for most deaths averted from breast cancer.</p>
      <p>“To reduce cancer death rates, it's critical that we combine effective strategies in prevention and screening with advances in treatment,” said W. Kimryn Rathmell, M.D., Ph.D., director of NCI. “This study will help us understand which strategies have been most effective in reducing cancer deaths so that we can continue building on this momentum and hopefully increase the use of these strategies across the United States.”</p>

      <p>“The Biden Cancer Moonshot is making real progress towards its bold goal to reduce the cancer death rate by at least 50% by 2047,” said Danielle Carnival, Ph.D., deputy assistant to the President for the Cancer Moonshot and deputy director, Health Outcomes, White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. “This study makes clear that the increased prevention and screening efforts championed and delivered on by the President and First Lady are crucial to reaching this ambitious goal.”</p>
      <p>The researchers used statistical models from the Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network (CISNET) and cancer mortality data to estimate the relative contributions of prevention, screening, and treatment advances to deaths averted from breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancers between 1975 and 2020.</p>

      <p>Improvements in cancer prevention and screening have averted more deaths from five cancer types combined over the past 45 years than treatment advances, according to a modeling study led by researchers at the National Institutes of Health (NIH). The study, published Dec. 5, 2024, in JAMA Oncology, looked at deaths from breast, cervical, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer that were averted by the combination of prevention, screening, and treatment advancesExit Disclaimer. The researchers from NIH’s National Cancer Institute (NCI) focused on these five cancers because they are among the most common causes of cancer deaths and strategies exist for their prevention, early detection, and/or treatment. In recent years, these five cancers have made up nearly half of all new cancer diagnoses and deaths.</p>
      <p>"Although many people may believe that treatment advances are the major driver of reductions in mortality from these five cancers combined, the surprise here is how much prevention and screening contribute to reductions in mortality," said co-lead investigator Katrina A. B. Goddard, Ph.D., director of NCI’s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences. “Eight out of 10 deaths from these five cancers that were averted over the past 45 years were due to advances in prevention and screening.”</p>
      <p>A single prevention intervention, smoking cessation, contributed the lion’s share of the deaths averted: 3.45 million from lung cancer alone. When considering each cancer site individually, prevention and screening accounted for most deaths averted for cervical, colorectal, lung, and prostate cancer, whereas treatment advances accounted for most deaths averted from breast cancer.</p>
      <p>“To reduce cancer death rates, it's critical that we combine effective strategies in prevention and screening with advances in treatment,” said W. Kimryn Rathmell, M.D., Ph.D., director of NCI. “This study will help us understand which strategies have been most effective in reducing cancer deaths so that we can continue building on this momentum and hopefully increase the use of these strategies across the United States.”</p>
