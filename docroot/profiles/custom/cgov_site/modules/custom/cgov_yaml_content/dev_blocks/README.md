Yeah, so we need to tweak some blocks to match the yaml content after loading. This is not just loading up some block as we have to manipulate any loaded blocks, plus add new ones. So this is not strictly YAML content, but IS related to the YAML content that we load onto local dev instances and ODEs.

These files should be named the same name of the block config.
