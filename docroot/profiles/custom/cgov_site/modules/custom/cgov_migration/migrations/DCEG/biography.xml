<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Amundadottir received a Ph.D. in cell biology in 1995 from Georgetown University in Washington, D.C. She conducted her postdoctoral training with Dr. Phil Leder in the Department of Genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts, then joined deCODE Genetics in Iceland in 1998 as the head of the Division of Cancer Genetics, where she led genome-wide linkage and association efforts in various cancers. Dr. Amundadottir joined the NCI in 2007 as a senior scientist and became a tenure-track investigator in the Laboratory of Translational Genomics in 2008. She was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH and promoted to senior investigator in 2017. Her work focuses on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and other gene mapping approaches to identify germline variants associated with risk of pancreatic cancer and the functional approaches required to understand the biological mechanisms by which they influence risk of pancreatic cancer.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Major advances have occurred in the last few years in our understanding of the genetics of common diseases. Genome-wide association studies, which assess hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in large cohort and case-control studies, have provided new insights into the inherited factors that contribute to risk of developing cancer. These efforts have led to the discovery of thousands of chromosomal loci that significantly associate with one or more complex diseases or traits, including cancer. However, for most of the identified loci, the elucidation of the functional basis underlying disease risk is in the very early stages. This interface between gene mapping approaches and the function of risk variants is of special interest to my laboratory.</p>
<h4>Gene Mapping in Pancreatic Cancer</h4>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Amundadottir co-leads PanScan, a GWAS of pancreatic cancer conducted within the framework of the NCI-sponsored Cohort Consortium. Collaborative efforts are conducted&nbsp;with the Pancreatic Cancer Case Control Consortium (PanC4), the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium, the European Study on Pancreatic Cancer Genetics and Epidemology (PanGen-EU), and Chinese and Japanese pancreatic cancer GWAS efforts. The aim of these large international studies is to identify genetic factors that contribute to the risk of pancreatic cancer. Four GWAS phases have already been performed in close to 12,000 case and 17,000 control subjects from over 30 cohort and case-control studies from the U.S., Europe and Asia. This work has resulted in the discovery of fourteen common susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer on chromosomes 1q32.1 (<i>NR5A2, </i>two independent loci), 2p14 (<i>ETAA1</i>), 3q28 (<i>TP63</i>), 5p15.33 (three independent risk loci in the <i>TERT-CLPTM1L</i> region), 7p14.1 (<i>SUGCT</i>), 7q23.2 (<i>LINC-PINT</i>), 8q24.1 (<em>MYC/PVT1</em> region, two independent loci), 9q34.2 (<i>ABO</i>), 13q12.2 (<i>PDX1</i>), 13q22.1 (nongenic), 16q23.1 (<i>BCAR1/CTRB1/CTRB2</i>), 17q24.3 (<i>LINC00673</i>) and 22q12.1 (<i>ZNRF3</i>). Further GWAS phases, as well as studies that aim at uncovering less common and rare pancreatic cancer risk variants, are underway.</p>
<h4>Functional Characterization of Pancreatic Cancer Risk Loci</h4>
<p>My laboratory conducts fine-mapping of risk loci identified in PanScan and collaborative gene mapping efforts, as well as wet-lab studies to uncover functional variants at each locus and understand the mechanism by which they influence risk of pancreatic cancer. This work involves genomic and epigenomic approaches, with a focus on genome-wide expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses to investigate the genetics of gene expression in normal and tumor derived pancreatic tissue samples and correlate to pancreatic cancer risk alleles as well as Transcriptome Wide Association Studies (TWAS) for gene mapping. These transcriptome and epigenome datasets are&nbsp;generated in our laboratory and supplemented with&nbsp;publicly available datasets. Furthermore, my laboratory focuses on targeted functional analyses in specific pancreatic cancer susceptibility loci. This work includes analysis of gene expression in the vicinity of risk variants, investigation of transcriptional regulation and gene/protein function with the aim of connecting pancreatic cancer risk variants to target genes and molecular phenotypes to explain the underlying biology of the risk at each locus.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Silverman is chief of the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch within the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI. She received an Sc.D. in epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health and an Sc.M. in biostatistics from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health. She joined the NCI as a biostatistician in 1972, and has served as a cancer epidemiologist since 1983.</p>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Silverman has received numerous awards, including the Harvard School of Public Health Alumni Award of Merit for the scientific importance and public health impact of her research; the PHS Special Recognition Award for research on environmental determinants of bladder and other cancers; the American Occupational Medical Association Merit in Authorship Award for her contributions to a paper on a job/exposure linkage system; the NIH Director&rsquo;s Award, the NCI Special Act Award, the NIOSH Alice Hamilton Science Award for Occupational Safety and Health, and the British Occupational Hygiene Society Award in recognition of her work on the Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study; the NIH Merit Award for her contributions to pancreatic cancer research; and the DCEG Exemplary Service and Investigator Award. She was a finalist for the NIOSH Alice Hamilton Science Award for Occupational Safety and Health for her research on diesel exhaust exposure and lung cancer in truck drivers. Dr. Silverman is an elected member of the American Epidemiological Society and a Fellow of the American College of Epidemiology.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<h3>Occupational, Environmental and Host Determinants of Cancer</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Silverman&rsquo;s research involves the design and conduct of epidemiologic investigations to evaluate occupational, environmental, and host determinants of cancer. She and her colleagues closely monitor new findings from clinical observations, experimental studies, and descriptive and analytic epidemiology for leads as to causes of cancer. Her research focuses particularly on the etiology of cancers of the bladder and pancreas and on the carcinogenic effects of diesel exhaust.</p>
<h3>Carcinogenicity of Diesel Exhaust and Outdoor Air Pollutants</h3>
<p class="first-graf">The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified diesel exhaust as a human carcinogen in 2012, based in large part on the findings from the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=40&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303672" sys_contentid="303672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303672" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7252487" sys_variantid="1418">Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS)</a>, which was designed and directed by Dr. Silverman and her colleagues at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</p>
<p class="first-graf">Diesel exhaust is a general airborne contaminant. Exposure is ubiquitous in cities and among commuters who regularly use highways. Occupational exposures are higher than those of the general population, especially among miners, transportation workers and other operators of diesel powered equipment.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="first-graf">Outdoor air pollution also causes lung cancer but the specific pollutant driving the risk is unknown.&nbsp; Dr. Silverman, in collaboration with Dr. Rena Jones, is conducting a study in the LA Basin (Los Angeles Ultrafines Study) to determine the role of ultrafine particles in lung cancer etiology.&nbsp; This study employs state-of-the-art exposure assessment to determine historical ultrafine exposure in members of the AARP cohort in LA.</p>
<h3>Bladder Cancer</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Bladder cancer is recognized as an occupationally-related tumor. During the past three decades, scores of bladder cancer studies have suggested more than 40 high-risk occupations, yet the specific exposures responsible for most of the excess risks remain largely unknown. Known and suspect occupational bladder carcinogens include aromatic amines, diesel exhaust, cutting oil mist, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, aryl hydrocarbons, and their derivatives.</p>
<p>Dr. Silverman heads the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=438648" sys_contentid="438648" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="438648" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7252488" sys_variantid="1418">New England Bladder Cancer Study</a>, which was designed to determine the reasons for excess bladder cancer risk in northern New England. This complex multidisciplinary investigation includes both an environmental component, with detailed exposure assessment for arsenic and disinfection by-products in drinking water, and a biologic component.</p>
<p>She is also the NCI principal investigator of a hospital-based case-control study of bladder cancer in Spain to clarify the etiologic role of suspected occupational carcinogens and to evaluate a variety of non-occupational exposures, including genetic susceptibility markers, and gene-environment interactions. Biologic specimens have been collected to examine genetic susceptibility in relation to risk of bladder cancer.</p>
<h3>Pancreatic Cancer</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Silverman has carried out numerous studies of pancreatic cancer to identify risk factors that play a role in the etiology of this malignancy. Her research has helped to establish the causal relationships for smoking, heavy alcohol consumption, obesity, diabetes, and family history of the array of tumors associated with hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. In particular, her work has also focused on factors contributing to the high rates experienced by African Americans. She continues her research in this area by following up earlier case-control findings on obesity, diabetes, heavy alcohol consumption, smoking habits, and pesticide use.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<h3><strong>Immunosuppression and&nbsp;Infection in Cancer</strong></h3>
<p>A major focus of investigation concerns the epidemiology of cancer in immunosuppressed individuals. My research on HIV-related cancers utilizes data from our <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=12&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303678" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7280132" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303678" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_folderid="" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303678">HIV/AIDS Cancer Match (HACM) Study</a>. This study links HIV and cancer registry data from 11 U.S. regions to identify cancers arising in over 880,000 people registered with HIV infection. The HACM Study allows my colleagues and me to address important research questions and examine patterns of cancer incidence that have direct public health relevance. We have used this resource to characterize trends in cancer risk among people with HIV over the entire course of the HIV epidemic. Our studies have documented substantial declines over time in cancers caused by viral infections, such as Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as HIV treatment has improved. In contrast, there has been an increase in the burden of cancers not associated with immunosuppression, especially as the number of people living with HIV increases and as the HIV population ages.</p>
<p>My coworkers and I also conduct research on cancer in solid organ transplant recipients, another immunosuppressed population. We have conducted a computerized match of the U.S. transplant registry with 18 cancer registries. This <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303740" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7280133" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303740" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_folderid="" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303740">Transplant Cancer Match Study</a> includes population-based cancer data on approximately half of the U.S. transplant population. Our research on cancer in transplant recipients is conducted in close collaboration with colleagues at the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees the U.S. transplant network. Using these data, we have described the overall spectrum of cancer risk in transplant recipients, and we are doing further research projects focused on specific cancers and transplant-related risk factors.</p>
<p>I am also interested in cancers associated with other immune-related conditions, including autoimmune diseases, allergic conditions, and immunosenescence. The incidence of some cancers is elevated in relation to immune activation or inflammation, and some immune-modulating medications used to treat these conditions may also increase cancer risk. Finally, we are studying how immunosuppressive medical conditions such as HIV infection and solid organ transplantation affect patient outcomes after a cancer diagnosis.</p>

</div>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Kreimer is a senior investigator in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB). She focuses her research on the etiology and prevention of <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=419301&amp;sys_revision=13&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="419301" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7280052">human papillomavirus (HPV) and cancers </a>at multiple sites, including the head and neck and anogenital region.&nbsp;Dr. Kreimer&nbsp;has particular interests in translational research, cancer etiology related to the natural history of HPV infection at multiple anatomic sites, and cancer prevention. She received a Ph.D. in infectious disease epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2003.&nbsp;Dr. Kreimer&nbsp;conducted postdoctoral research at the International Agency for Research on Cancer in Lyon, France and the National Cancer Institute, NIH.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p id="research">Dr. Kreimer&rsquo;s scientific interests lay in the evaluation of:</p>
<ul>
<li>The performance of prophylactic HPV vaccines, with a particular focus on single-dose efficacy;</li>
<li>Understanding the natural history of HPV infections at multiple anatomic sites; and,</li>
<li>HPV 16 E6 seropositivity as a possible biomarker for HPV-driven cancers.</li>
</ul>
<p>HPV type 16 (HPV 16) infection is one of the most important human carcinogens, causing ~300,000 cancer deaths per year worldwide, the majority of which are due to cervical cancer in low-income countries. It is well established that persistent infection with HPV 16, 18, or other carcinogenic HPV genotypes is the necessary, but not sufficient, cause of cervical cancer. Infection with HPV 16 is an established risk factor for some cancers at additional anatomic sites, including cancers of the anus, oropharynx, vagina, vulva, and penis. Of note, whereas HPV type 16 causes about 50 percent of cervical cancers, at other anatomic sites, it causes upwards of 90 percent of the non-cervical HPV-driven cancers.</p>
<p>The advent of the HPV prophylactic vaccine has the potential to dramatically reduce the burden of HPV-associated cancers. Despite this success, many important research questions remain. For example, how long will the vaccine protect at the cervix? How many doses are truly needed to provide durable protection? Since the vaccine should confer immunity on all mucosal surfaces where HPV causes cancer, does the HPV vaccine provide durable protection against infections at non-cervical anatomic sites where HPV causes cancer?</p>
<p>Dr. Kreimer is co-principal investigator of the Costa Rica HPV Vaccine Trial long-term follow-up study (CVT LTFU), a study that started as a randomized controlled trial of the bivalent HPV vaccine, in collaboration with Agencia Costarricense de Investigaciones Biom&eacute;dicas (ACIB), and transitioned to an epidemiologic cohort study for the long-term follow-up phase. Using data from this study, Dr. Kreimer and colleagues were the first to demonstrate that that vaccine efficacy against incident persistent HPV 16/18 infection was comparably high among women who received three, two, or even a single dose of vaccine four years after HPV vaccination.&nbsp;They recently updated their findings and showed that a single dose continues to provide robust protection up to seven years after HPV vaccination. Her team has also documented that the bivalent vaccine strongly protects against HPV infections at essentially all non-cervical anatomic sites where HPV causes cancer in a woman (i.e., the anus, vulva, and oral region), and that the level of protection was comparably high to that observed at the cervix among the same women. The CVT LTFU field effort recently completed; women were followed for a median of 11 years following the initial vaccination. While our data on single-dose protection of the bivalent HPV are compelling, their post-hoc nature make the data inadequate to justify a formal change in current multi-dose HPV vaccine recommendations. A new trial was needed to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness and potential public health impact of a single-dose strategy.</p>
<p>Dr. Kreimer and her NCI team, again in collaboration with ACIB, implemented the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1102867" sys_contentid="1102867" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1102867" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7280048" sys_variantid="1418">ESCUDDO study (Estudio de Comparacion de Una y Dos Dosis de Vacunas Contra el Virus de Papiloma Humano)</a>, a large, randomized, controlled, noninferiority efficacy trial designed to formally investigate the protection afforded by a single dose of the bivalent Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup> and nonavalent GARDASIL<sup>&reg;</sup>9 HPV vaccines in Costa Rica. The main goals of the trial are to evaluate whether, in adolescent girls, one dose or two doses of these vaccines confers strong, durable protection against persistent HPV16/18 infections. Virologic endpoints are necessary in the evaluation of a one-dose schedule, as one-dose antibody levels are inferior to those of two doses, and presently, the minimum antibody level required for protection is unknown. Separately for each vaccine, one dose will be tested for noninferiority against the two-dose regimen. Analyses will also be conducted to estimate the vaccine efficacy versus no vaccination using a concurrent population survey of comparable, unvaccinated age-matched females in the same region, who will be tested for HPV DNA and then immediately vaccinated. Immunogenicity induced by these different vaccine dose schedules and vaccine products will be compared. Study results are expected in 2025 and are intended to provide definitive results for recommending bodies, if warranted.</p>
<p>Despite the great potential of HPV vaccination, the current birth cohorts (individuals in their 30s, 40s, 50s, etc.) will not experience the protection afforded by prophylactic HPV vaccines. Therefore, screening will remain an important tool in our fight against cancer for decades as these individuals age into cancer-susceptible phases of life. Thus, continued research into possible biomarkers of HPV-driven cancers is necessary. Dr. Kreimer and colleagues from the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) and the German Cancer Research Center (DKFZ) discovered that the HPV 16 E6 antibody marker predicts risk of oropharyngeal cancer years before cancer development. They validated their discovery in an independent U.S.-based NCI cohort, the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovary (PLCO) Screening Trial. Based on these findings, Dr. Kreimer and team formed the HPV Cancer Cohort Consortium (HPVC3) involving nine prospective cohort studies from Europe, North America and Australia. The main aim of HPVC3 is to evaluate HPV antibodies and risk of HPV-driven cancers, with a focus on oropharyngeal and anal cancer, but also including penile, cervical, vaginal and vulvar cancer. Blood was collected up to 40 years prior to cancer diagnosis in this pooled effort. Dr. Kreimer also investigates HPV 16-E6 seroprevalence and kinetics in people without cancer.</p>

<h2 id="biography"><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Blair received a Ph.D. in genetics from North Carolina State University and an M.P.H. in epidemiology from the University of North Carolina. He joined the NCI as a staff fellow in 1976, and was appointed to head the Occupational Studies Section in 1978. He was appointed Chief of the group when it became a branch in 1996. At NIH, he received the NIH Director's Award, PHS Special Recognition Award, NIH Merit Award, the DHHS Quality of Work Life Award, and the NIH Director's Award for the Deepwater Horizon Gulf Oil Spill Study. Other awards include the University of North Carolina H.A. Tyroler Distinguished Alumni Award, John Goldsmith Award for Outstanding Contributions to Environmental Epidemiology from the International Society for Environmental Epidemiology, the Harriet Barr Distinguished Alumnus Award from the Public Health Alumnus Association of the University of North Carolina, NIOSH Alice Hamilton Award for Excellence in Occupational Safety and Health, Kansas Wesleyan University Alumni Achievement Award, EPICOH Award for Outstanding Contributions to Occupational Epidemiology, and APHA Epidemiology Section Wade Hampton Frost Annual Lectureship Award. He has served on numerous review groups for IARC, EPA, and other agencies, organizations, and institutions.</p>
<p>Dr. Blair currently serves as an advisor on the Chlordecone Scientific Committee (Institute National du Cancer, France), Pesticide Advisory Committee (Carex Canada), and Independent Advisory Board for Exposure Assessment (Institute of Occupational Medicine, Scotland). He has authored/coauthored more than 500 papers on occupational and environmental causes of cancer, other diseases, and epidemiologic methodology.</p>
<h2><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Blair&rsquo;s research focuses on evaluating cancer and other disease risks associated with agricultural exposures, chemicals in the workplace and the general environment, and methodologic issues in occupational epidemiology.</p>
<h3>Pesticides</h3>
<p>Studies of pesticides have been a major focus throughout&nbsp;Dr. Blair's&nbsp;career. Pesticides are widely used chemicals, specifically designed to have toxic effects to some species. A number are carcinogenic in laboratory animals. The toxic nature of these agents raises questions about their possible impact on human health, although not specifically designed for this purpose. Dr. Blair&rsquo;s early studies focused on farmers because they have heavier and more frequent exposures to pesticides than the general population and because they are able to describe their pesticide usage. Despite an overall lower mortality than the general population, farmers have excess cancers of the lip, stomach, brain, prostate, skin, and the lymphatic and hematopoietic system, as well as some nonmalignant chronic diseases. Ongoing studies in agriculture are designed to identify risk factors that account for these excesses.</p>
<p>Dr. Blair&rsquo;s early mortality studies of agricultural populations, death certificate case-control studies, and cancer incidence case-control studies of lymphatic and hematopoietic indicated that pesticide exposures were likely to contribute to the development of cancer. Previous biomarker studies found urinary levels of 2,4 D resulted in increased lymphocyte replication levels were greater after exposure than before. This body of work provided much of the background for the launch of the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a major prospective investigation of farmers and their families in 1992. Since its initiation, the AHS has provided, and continues to provide, critical new information on the role of pesticides and other agricultural exposures in the development of cancer and diseases of the respiratory, neurologic, and reproductive systems, as well as other outcomes and conditions. Dr. Blair continues to participate in the AHS as a member of the Executive Committee, Scientist Emeritus,&nbsp;and as a coauthor on selected papers. He is also a collaborator in the North American Pesticide Project that pools case-control studies of lymphatic and hematopoietic cancers from the United States and Canada to evaluate the etiologic role of pesticides.</p>

<div class="dceg-bio-content">
<h3>Tobacco products in cancer and disease</h3>
<p>It has long been known that tobacco causes many different types of cancer. Yet, the tobacco epidemic has changed substantially over the past 50 years. Thankfully, with concerted tobacco cessation and prevention efforts, the prevalence of smoking has decreased in the United States. Still, more than 15 percent of Americans continue to smoke cigarettes. In the past, many more men smoked than women, and they started smoking earlier. Currently, however, similar proportions of men and women smoke, and they typically start smoking at similar ages. There have also been many changes in the design and construction of cigarettes. New and emerging tobacco products are also gaining popularity, including electronic cigarettes and water pipes; yet whether these products cause cancer is unclear. We are working to determine the impact of such changes on cancer risks.</p>

<h3>Coffee and other aspects of diet and energy balance in liver cancer</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Liver cancer is the second most common cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Strong risk factors have been identified including aflatoxin, alcohol, and chronic hepatitis B and C infection, but a substantial proportion of liver cancer cases in the United States lack these exposures. The liver is a major metabolic organ, important for the regulation of fatty acid, insulin, and glucose signaling. Diabetes and adiposity are consistent risk factors for liver cancer, suggesting an important role for energy balance. Diet may also be important, with proposed associations for coffee, red and white meat, fats, sugars, fruits and vegetables, and micronutrients. My work has investigated associations of dietary and environmental exposures with liver cancer, with a recent focus on coffee drinking. In epidemiologic studies, coffee has been consistently and inversely associated with liver cancer and diabetes. Emerging data also suggest that coffee drinking is inversely related to overall mortality. We are conducting epidemiologic and molecular studies to better understand these observed inverse associations.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Morton received a B.A. from Dartmouth College and a Ph.D. in epidemiology from Yale University with a focus on cancer epidemiology. She joined DCEG in 2004 as a postdoctoral fellow with a concentration in molecular epidemiology. During her doctoral and postdoctoral training, she focused her research on understanding the causes of lymphoid neoplasms.</p>
<p>In 2008, Dr. Morton joined the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) as a tenure-track investigator. She expanded her research to the study of multiple primary cancers, evaluating the carcinogenic effects of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as other environmental and genetic risk factors for second cancers. In 2015, Dr. Morton was awarded scientific tenure by NIH and became a senior investigator.</p>
<p>Dr. Morton has been recognized for her research contributions with an NCI Career Development Innovation Award, an NIH Merit Award, and an NCI Director&rsquo;s Award. In addition, she received the DCEG Mentoring Award in recognition of her strong commitment to training junior scientists.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>In recent decades, new treatments and early detection have dramatically improved survival following a cancer diagnosis. However, new malignancies, or &ldquo;second cancers,&rdquo; are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among survivors. The overarching goal of Dr. Morton&rsquo;s research program is to quantify the risk of second cancers in different groups of cancer survivors, and to elucidate the causes of second cancers. The results from her studies can be used to better understand the biology of cancer and to inform clinical practice (e.g., treatment risks and benefits and long-term follow-up of cancer survivors).</p>
<h3>Genetic Susceptibility to Second Cancers</h3>
<p>With rapid advances in technology in the last decade, scientists have dramatically increased their understanding of cancer predisposition, finding inherited genetic markers that are associated with risk for a particular disease. Dr. Morton is leading DCEG efforts to identify genetic variants associated with the development of second cancers, either independent of treatment exposures or that act jointly with specific treatments. Key studies in this collaboration are the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=16&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302605" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302605" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276850" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302605">Childhood Cancer Survivor Study</a> and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303648" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303648" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276851" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303648">NCI&rsquo;s Long-Term Follow-Up Study of Retinoblastoma Survivors</a>, both of which have the rare combination of detailed medical record data, long-term follow-up of childhood cancer survivors with information on occurrence of second cancers, and available DNA.</p>
<h3>Treatment-Related Second Cancers</h3>
Primary cancer treatments are an important focus of second cancers research. Dr. Morton has an interest in the role of both radiotherapy and chemotherapy in second primary gastrointestinal malignancies, having recently completed a <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302397" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302397" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276852" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302397">multi-center international study of second primary gastrointestinal (GI) cancers</a> occurring among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the breast, cervix, and testis. Dr. Morton also expanded on her long-standing interest in hematopoietic malignancies by investigating treatment-related myelodysplasia and leukemia following radiotherapy and chemotherapy. This research focuses on quantifying the risk of myelodysplasia and leukemia in patients treated in the modern era, in which known cytotoxic chemotherapies have been increasingly used. Finally, Dr. Morton is leading several studies aimed at identifying second cancer risks in high-risk populations, such as recipients of solid organ and hematopoietic stem cell transplants.</div>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Hormuzd A. Katki received a B.S. in math from the University of Chicago and an M.S. in statistics from Carnegie-Mellon University. He received a Ph.D in biostatistics from Johns Hopkins University in 2006, where he received the Margaret Merrell Award for research by a biostatistics doctoral student. Dr. Katki joined NCI in 1999, became a principal investigator in 2009, and was appointed senior investigator upon receiving NIH scientific tenure in 2015.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Katki&rsquo;s research focuses on understanding how epidemiologic findings could be used for cancer screening and prevention. &nbsp;&nbsp;He is particularly interested in developing individualized risk-based approaches to cancer screening. His methodologic research focuses on estimating individual absolute risk, strategies for risk-based screening and management, and metrics for evaluating risk models and biomarkers.&nbsp; Dr. Katki is interested in mentoring both statisticians interested in cancer research, and also epidemiologists who want to use state-of-the-art quantitative and computational methods. If you are interested in a fellowship with Dr. Katki, please see our <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=24&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302382" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302382" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7276772" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302382">research training opportunities</a>.</p>
<h4>Lung Cancer Screening</h4>
<p>In spite of the definitive <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/lung/research/nlst">National Lung Screening Trial (NLST)</a> and USPSTF guidelines recommending screening, CT lung-cancer screening is still not widespread.&nbsp; This is partly due to the inefficiency of screening.&nbsp; To make screening more efficient, Dr. Katki conducts research on using risk calculations to better identify those who benefit the most from lung screening and to propose risk-based management options during the course of screening.</p>
<p>Dr. Katki developed validated individualized risk models for lung cancer incidence (<a href="https://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/lungCancerRiskAssessment/">LCRAT: Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool</a>) and mortality (<a href="https://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/lungCancerRiskAssessment/">LCDRAT: Lung Cancer Death Risk Assessment Tool</a>).&nbsp; Using these models to select ever-smokers at highest risk should improve screening effectiveness and efficiency versus current USPSTF guidelines.&nbsp; To empower doctors and patients with risk information needed to decide about undergoing screening, Dr. Katki collaborates with Dr. William Klein to improve the NCI lung cancer screening risk tool, the <a href="https://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/lungCancerScreening/">Risk-based NLST Outcomes Tool (RNOT)</a>.</p>
<p>The R package <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/tools/risk-assessment/lcmodels">lcmodels</a> estimates risk from 9 published lung cancer models: LCRAT, LCDRAT, Bach, PLCO<sub>M2012</sub>, Spitz, Hoggart, LLP, LLPi, and Pittsburgh.&nbsp; The R package <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/tools/risk-assessment/lcrisks">lcrisks</a> provides the risk calculators that are used by RNOT.</p>
<p>Dr. Katki is conducting research on a Markov model for updating individual lung cancer risk with CT image findings during the course of screening.&nbsp; This model may be useful to extend screening intervals for those at sufficiently low risk of developing lung cancer.</p>
<h4>Risk Models for Epidemiology</h4>
<p>Dr. Katki is interested in developing models for individualized risk estimation.</p>
<p>Dr. Katki has developed risk models for screening data, where some disease is already present at baseline (left-censored), some disease occurs between consecutive visits (interval censored), and some disease is unknown if it was prevalent or incident.&nbsp; These models, the logistic-Weibull and logistic-Cox models, can be accessed as part of R package <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/tools/analysis/pimixture/PIMixture">PImixture</a>.&nbsp; The models allow sampling weights.</p>
<p>He has helped develop methods and software for calculating absolute risk for case-cohort studies, or case-control studies nested within cohorts (also known as &ldquo;two-phase sampling&rdquo;) which is in the R package <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/tools/analysis/nested-cohort">NestedCohort</a>.</p>
<p>He has proposed <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22865328">a hybrid risk regression model called &ldquo;LEXPIT&rdquo;</a> that allows for both additive and multiplicative effects in logistic regression, and allows sampling weights.&nbsp; LEXPIT is in the R package <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/blm/index.html">blm</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Katki is conducting research on improving the external validity of epidemiologic cohort analyses by including data from nationally representative surveys.</p>
<p>Dr. Katki is also helping with research to develop individualized models of years of life gained by screening to select people for screening.&nbsp; Years of life gained is a measure of the benefit of screening, and as such is more relevant than simply using risk to select people for screening.</p>
<h4>Metrics for evaluating diagnostic tests and risk prediction models</h4>
<p>Dr. Katki is interested all aspects of evaluating the potential of new biomarkers for clinical use.</p>
<p>In particular, he has done research quantify <em>risk stratification</em>, the ability of a test or model to separate those at high-risk from those at low-risk.&nbsp; His metric Mean Risk Stratification (MRS) is the average change in a person&rsquo;s risk that is revealed by using a risk model or test. &nbsp;MRS better compares tests across populations with different disease prevalence by interpreting AUC in the context of prevalence.&nbsp; He has used MRS to compare the risk stratification from cervical screening tests and risk models to identify who in a family carries a mutation in <em>BRCA1/2</em>.&nbsp; The MRS webtool is part of the <a href="https://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/biomarkerTools/">Biomarker Tools Suite</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Katki has developed methods for calculating diagnostic accuracy and agreement statistics under verification bias, when one test is conducted on only a subsample of specimens, in R package <a href="http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/CompareTests/index.html">CompareTests</a>.</p>
<h4>Cervical Cancer Screening and HPV-related cancers</h4>
<p>Dr. Katki he led a team that calculated cervical cancer risks, using the logistic-Weibull model, for women using data on 1.4 million women at Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC). These risks enabled guidelines to ensure &ldquo;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27323876">equal management of women at equal risk of cancer</a>&rdquo;. The resulting 2012 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Guidelines and the eight reports with the supporting data were published in a 2013 supplement of the <a href="http://journals.lww.com/jlgtd/toc/2013/04001"><em>Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease</em></a> .&nbsp;</p>
<p>He developed the &ldquo;Risk Bar&rdquo; for the <a href="http://www.asccp.org/store-detail2/asccp-mobile-app">risk-based App for the Consensus Guidelines for the Management of Abnormal Cervical Cancer Screening Tests and Cancer Precursors</a>, based on woman&rsquo;s history of HPV, Pap smear, and biopsy results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Katki collaborates with <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/chaturvedi-anil">Dr. Anil Chaturvedi</a> on oral HPV and oropharyngeal cancer, conducting research on natural history with an eye towards future prevention.</p>
<h4>Population-based mutation screening</h4>
<p>Dr. Katki is developing risk-based approaches to help propose risk-based screening programs for genetic mutations, such as for <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em>.</p>

<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Albanes received a B.S. in biology from the State University of New York at Stony Brook and his M.D. degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin. Dr. Albanes entered the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) through which he began working in the cancer prevention program of the NCI in 1982. Thereafter, Dr. Albanes completed a Preventive Medicine residency with the CDC and continued his research in the Cancer Prevention Studies Branch of NCI from 1984 to 1990, when he received scientific tenure. He joined the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics in 2000 as a senior investigator in the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch, and served as Chief of the DCEG Office of Education until 2008. Dr. Albanes is principal investigator of the landmark <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303743" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303743" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7252363" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303743">Alpha-Tocopherol Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study</a> and serves as chair of the NIH Committee on Scientific Conduct and Ethics.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h2><a id="Research"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Albanes conducts a molecular epidemiologic program that is focused on prostate and other cancers in relation to micronutrients (particularly vitamins D, E, and A), vitamin supplementation, and metabolite profiles through biochemical, genetic, and mechanistic investigations. His recent prospective metabolomics studies have discovered novel serologic profiles for prostate cancer, glioma, and vitamin supplementation and serum status. Dr. Albanes has also highlighted the importance of hyperinsulinemia, a hyperthyroid state, higher vitamin D and A status, and lower vitamin E status in elevated prostate cancer risk. This high-incidence malignancy is of essentially unknown etiology other than being more frequent in men with a first-degree family history of the disease, in African-Americans, and being associated with over 100 common genetic variants.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3>Micronutrients and Cancer</h3>
<p>Our ATBC Study found 18% higher lung cancer incidence in men supplemented with 20 mg beta-carotene daily for 5-8 years, and 32% lower prostate cancer incidence in those receiving 50 IU vitamin E. We did not confirm the latter finding in the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT), but rather showed 17% higher prostate cancer incidence in men receiving 400 IU vitamin E daily. The latter findings indicated that supplementation with supra-physiological vitamin dosages could have deleterious health outcomes and highlighted the importance of large controlled trials in cancer epidemiological research. By contrast, that a low, physiological dose of vitamin E may prevent prostate cancer remains an active hypothesis that we have pursued through cohort, nested case-control, genetic, and experimental investigations.</p>
<p>We are comprehensively investigating the role of vitamin D in cancer because the epidemiological data have been inconsistent and there has been a widespread presumption of the beneficial effects of supplementation. Our studies include prospective nested case-control studies measuring the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D (25(OH)D), and its major carrier protein, vitamin D binding protein (DBP); genetic analyses; and ChIP-Seq cell culture experiments testing biological mechanisms. Based in part on our research, there is a growing consensus in the field that, 1) men with higher vitamin D status are at increased risk of prostate cancer, 2) a beneficial, preventive association exists for colorectal cancer, and, 3) null associations exist for most other organ sites, including breast cancer. Many of these biochemical associations are supported by our analyses of vitamin D genetic variants/polygenic scores based on our genome-wide association study (GWAS) findings for the 25(OH)D phenotype. We have also shown that serum DBP both modifies vitamin D risk associations (e.g., for prostate and pancreatic cancer) and directly affects risk (e.g., inverse association in prostate cancer in black men). Cell culture ChIP-Seq experiments we are conducting in collaboration with our DCEG Laboratory of Translational Genomics are examining the effects of vitamins D (and E) on prostate cancer growth, VDR-AR-RXR nuclear receptor interactions, and gene transcription sites. We are also studying the role of vitamin D in cancer survival, finding that higher serum 25(OH)D years prior to diagnosis predicts improved survival of prostate, and possibly renal, gastric, pancreatic and liver cancers.</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a id="Metabolomic-Profiling"></a>Metabolomic Profiling of Cancer Risk</h3>
<p>Identifying effective serologic biomarkers of cancer risk and early detection are critical to its prevention and reduction of mortality. Metabolomic profiling of blood represents a relatively new agnostic, "broad-spectrum" approach for examining potential metabolic biomarkers of risk. We initiated a program to investigate prospectively serum metabolites associated with cancer risk, and found strong inverse associations between energy and lipid metabolites and aggressive prostate cancer, including for inositol-1-phosphate, glycerophospholipids and fatty acids, as well as TCA cycle compounds alpha-ketoglutarate and citrate. Prostate cancer survival appears related to androgen and endocannabinoid metabolism. We showed a very different profile for risk of glioma, with 2-oxoarginine, cysteine, chenodeoxycholate and argininate being the strongest metabolite signals (inversely related), along with several xanthine metabolites related to caffeine metabolism being elevated in cases. The observed patterns provide new potential leads regarding the molecular basis relevant to etiologic or sub-clinical biomarkers for prostate cancer and glioma that we are pursuing in the <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/comets/">Consortium of Metabolomics Studies</a> (COMETS).</p>
<p><a href="#top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a id="Metabolomic-and-Genetic"></a>Metabolomic and Genetic Studies of Vitamin Status</h3>
<p>Within the ATBC Study, we conducted a serum metabolomic profile of response to beta-carotene supplementation that revealed dysregulation of xenobiotic metabolism. We have observed a number of lipid metabolites associated with serum vitamin D, including for example, 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-propyl-2-furanpropanoic acid (CMPF), and the omega-3 essential fatty acids eicosapentaenoate (EPA) and docosahexaenoate (DHA), and found several metabolites associated with serum vitamin A (retinol), including N-acetyltryptophan), myo-inositol and inositol metabolism, which is of great interest given that we had found inositol 1-phosphate strongly associated with aggressive prostate cancer in the study described above. Such findings provide new biological clues relevant to the role of vitamins in human carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>We participate in large international cancer consortia that have identified hundreds of low-penetrance genetic variants associated with risk, and applied these GWAS data to serum vitamin status (including supplementation). For example, we identified four genes associated with vitamin D status&mdash;<em>GC</em>, <em>CYP2R1</em>, <em>DHCR7</em>, and <em>CYP24B1&mdash;</em>which collectively explained ~5 percent of vitamin D variance, and found their genetic vitamin D score was associated with prostate cancer risk in the same causal direction as our serum studies have shown. These Mendelian randomization studies provide an unbiased confirmation of our biochemical data.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Ward received an M.S. in ecology from the University of Tennessee and a Ph.D. in epidemiology from The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. She completed post-doctoral work in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch within the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, was appointed as a tenure-track investigator in 1999, and received tenure in 2008.&nbsp;Dr. Ward&nbsp;received a DCEG Intramural Research Award in 1999 and an NIH Merit Award in 2000 for her work using geographical information systems for exposure assessment of environmental contaminants. She received the DCEG Mentoring Award in 2011 and the NCI Women Scientist Advisors' Mentoring and Leadership Award in 2016. Dr. Ward is a Fellow of the American College of Epidemiology.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Ward&rsquo;s research focuses on environmental and occupational causes of cancer, with special emphasis on <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303673" sys_contentid="303673" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7390591" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303673" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418">drinking water contaminants,</a> pesticides, and other chemicals in relation to the etiology of childhood leukemia, gastrointestinal cancers, and thyroid cancer. She is examining nitrate in drinking water and the diet with respect to cancers of the bladder, colon, stomach, esophagus, ovary, and thyroid. Dr. Ward is responsible for developmental work using geographic information systems for exposure assessment of environmental contaminants.</p>
<h4>Nitrates, Pesticides and Cancer and Environmental Exposure Assessment</h4>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Ward&nbsp;uses <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=5&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1072335" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1072335" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7390593" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1072335">innovative methods such as geographic information systems (GIS)</a> to display and analyze environmental exposure data. Using GIS and remote sensing data, she is&nbsp;participating in interdisciplinary collaborations to develop new methods of exposure assessment for epidemiologic studies of cancer risk in relation to drinking water contaminants, agricultural pesticides, and other environmental contaminants.</p>
<h4>Nitrates, Nitrite, and N-nitroso Compounds</h4>
<p>The endogenous formation of carcinogenic N-nitroso compounds (NOC) can occur following ingestion of nitrate from drinking water. Certain foods are also sources of nitrate and nitrite. Nitrate can also inhibit iodide uptake by the thyroid. Only a limited number of analytic epidemiologic studies have evaluated these exposures with respect to diet and drinking water. Dr. Ward&nbsp;conducted case-control studies that found an increased risk of colon and kidney cancer associated with prior exposure to elevated nitrate in drinking water among those who also had lower intakes of vitamin C and higher intakes of red meat, inhibitors and precursors in the endogenous formation of NOC. Increasing intake of dietary nitrite, a major source of which is processed meats, was associated with increased risk of colorectal adenomas, colon, rectum, pancreas, thyroid, and ovarian cancers in case-control and/or cohort studies. Drinking water nitrate increased the risk of thyroid, bladder, kidney, and ovarian cancers in a cohort of older women in Iowa.</p>
<p>To follow up upon these findings, Dr. Ward led interdisciplinary collaborations to develop GIS-based random forest models to estimate nitrate levels in the drinking water wells of participants of the Agricultural Health Study, a cohort of pesticide applicators and their spouses with high exposure to nitrate through their private wells.&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Pesticides and Other Chemicals</h4>
<p>A feasibility study using remote sensing data and a GIS to estimate indirect exposure to pesticides demonstrated that using available data, accurate historical crop maps could be produced and that these could be linked to pesticide use data to estimate probabilities of indirect exposure to agricultural pesticides. This was the first study to estimate the prevalence of potential indirect exposure to agricultural pesticides in the general population. A validation study in Iowa found that increasing acreage of corn and soybean fields within 750 m of homes was associated with significantly elevated concentrations of agricultural herbicides compared with homes with no crops within 750 m even after accounting for the presence of an occupational exposed worker. Dr. Ward and colleagues are applying this exposure assessment approach to estimate residential exposures to agricultural pesticides in studies of childhood cancers in California and Denmark.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303596" sys_contentid="303596" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7390592" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303596" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418">case-control study of childhood leukemia in California</a>, Dr. Ward and colleagues&nbsp;analyzed carpet dust samples for pesticides and other chemicals. Analyses of persistent organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE) in carpet dust samples revealed an increased risk of acute lymphocytic leukemia among children living in homes with higher levels of PCB and specific PBDE congeners. In a nested-case control study of in the Norwegian Janus Serum Bank cohort, early life exposures to specific organochlorine chemicals were associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Brown received a Ph.D. in genetics from the George Washington University in Washington, D.C., in 2003. He conducted his postdoctoral training in the Laboratory of Dr. Jeffrey Trent at the Translational Genomic Research Institute (TGen) in Phoenix, Arizona.&nbsp;He subsequently went on to direct his own research program at TGen as an investigator from 2005 to 2010, and served as an adjunct professor in basic medical sciences at the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, the University of Arizona College of Medicine, and Arizona State University from 2008 to 2010.&nbsp;His work at TGen involved the application of whole-genome familial linkage, candidate gene, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) approaches to identify genetic variants associated with melanoma susceptibility. In 2010, Dr. Brown joined the Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) as a tenure-track investigator. He was awarded NIH scientific tenure in 2018. His research largely focuses on the genetic underpinnings of melanoma susceptibility.</p>
<h2><a id="Research"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<h3>Discovery of Germline Cancer Susceptibility Genes</h3>
<p>My research is focused on identifying the genetic contributions and functional pathways associated with cancer risk with a primary focus on melanoma. While early-stage melanoma is largely curable via surgical resection, late-stage melanoma remains nearly incurable despite decades of research. Much of the effort in my laboratory is directed towards better understanding the genetic factors contributing to melanoma risk, with a goal of ultimately facilitating prevention and early-detection efforts in at-risk individuals.&nbsp;We are actively involved in ongoing melanoma GWAS efforts within DCEG, and as members of the <a href="http://www.genomel.org/">International Melanoma Genetics Consortium (GenoMEL)</a>, we collaborate on melanoma GWAS meta-analyses as well as family studies. We also work with GenoMEL member groups to better understand the genetics of melanoma susceptibility in melanoma-prone families using whole-genome and -exome sequencing approaches. Lastly, we are actively involved in ongoing renal cell cancer GWAS at the NCI, as well as meta-analyses with international teams working in the same area.</p>
<h3>Functional Characterization of Cancer Susceptibility Loci</h3>
<p>Beyond susceptibility gene/locus discovery, a major focus of our laboratory is in the functional characterization of such loci. While significant strides have been made towards cataloging loci involved in cancer risk, elucidation of how risk variants influence susceptibility remains a significant challenge, with progress in this area lagging far behind. Our approach focuses both on better understanding the molecular consequences of specific risk variants on gene regulation and function, and on the phenotypic effects of allele-specific gene functions. Work in the laboratory involves fine-mapping of risk-associated regions, targeted and genome-wide expression analysis, gene regulation and epigenetic work, and bioinformatic analysis of large genomic datasets.</p>
<p>Current projects in the laboratory include a large-scale study of the&nbsp;influences of germline genetic variation on both gene regulation and cellular phenotypes in melanocytes and melanoma cells, functional genomic screens to identify genes that mediate phenotypes associated with early stage tumor progression, large-scale reporter screens to identify risk-associated genetic variants conferring allele-specific gene regulatory potential, and directed analyses applied to specific susceptibility regions and genes, presently including chromosome bands 1q21.3 (multi-gene), 1q42.12 (<em>PARP1</em>), 2q33.1 (<em>CASP8</em>), 5p15.33 (<em>TERT-CLPTM1L</em>), 7p21.1 (<em>AGR3/AHR</em>), 22q13.1 (<em>PLA2G6</em>), and 22q22.3 (<em>MX2</em>).</p>

<h3>Gastric cancer</h3>
<p class="first-graf">My work in gastric cancer encompasses&nbsp;four sub-projects on the pathogenic microbes, modifying host factors, molecular pathologic features, and intermediate markers with potential for screening of gastric cancer and pre-neoplastic lesions. I have a particular focus on the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) as a co-factor with <i>Helicobacter pylori,</i> the established cause of most cancers of the noncardia stomach. Viral coinfection is present in 8-10 percent&nbsp;of gastric cancers worldwide, and I lead an<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=5&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=827356" sys_contentid="827356" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7280126" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="827356" rxinlineslot="103">&nbsp;international consortium studying EBV's etiologic and clinicopathologic significance</a>.&nbsp;</p>

In other studies, I have implicated <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=1141199&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1141199" rxinlineslot="103" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7280129">autoimmune gastritis</a> as an emerging etiology underlying changing trends in cancer incidence.&nbsp;I am currently pursuing this novel hypothesis using multiple approaches, including examinations of administrative databases and testing for autoantibodies in prospective cohort studies.</p>
<h3>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a neoplasm of the effector cells that mediate adaptive immunity. I study the acquired and inherited abnormalities of immune cells that may contribute to their malignant transformation.&nbsp;AIDS-related lymphoma represents a particularly informative model, given its high incidence in defined populations under close medical supervision. To advance research efforts in this area, we have launched AIDSLymph, a consortium investigating associations and risk factors for lymphoma in patients with advanced HIV infection, in collaboration with the North American AIDS Cohorts Collaboration on Research &amp; Design (NA-ACCORD).</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Stolzenberg-Solomon received a B.S. in nutrition and dietetics at the University of California, Davis in 1984, followed by a dietetic internship and M.Ed. in health science (nutrition) education at Vanderbilt University Medical Center and George Peabody School of Education, respectively. After this training she worked as a registered dietitian for 10 years. In 1994, she completed an M.P.H. with concentrations in epidemiology and nutrition at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. Dr. Stolzenberg-Solomon joined the NCI in 1996 as a predoctoral fellow in the Cancer Prevention Studies Branch of the former Division of Cancer Prevention and Control and later the Center for Cancer Research, and subsequently earned a Ph.D. in epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1999. As a Cancer Prevention Fellow, she continued postdoctoral research in the Division of Cancer Prevention and DCEG. She became an investigator in the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch in December 2002, and was awarded NIH scientific tenure and promoted to senior investigator in 2011.</p>
<p>Dr. Stolzenberg-Solomon has won several awards in recognition of her contributions to cancer research, including the 2008 NIH Merit Award for sustained and innovative work in elucidating nutritional, genetic, infectious, and other determinants of pancreatic cancer. She is an active mentor, working with graduate students, as well as postdoctoral fellows. She serves on the editorial board of the <em>American Journal of Epidemiology</em> and <em>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention</em>. Dr. Stolzenberg-Solomon also holds a position as an adjunct Associate Professor at the Yale University School of Public Health and is a fellow of the American College of Epidemiology.</p>

</ul>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Stolzenberg-Solomon has focused much of her research on elucidating the etiology of pancreatic cancer. She has examined dietary, other lifestyle, genetic, and infectious factors, including biomarkers that may help reveal underlying mechanisms of carcinogenesis. In addition to her major work on pancreatic cancer, she has pursued, on a limited basis, other nutrition-related hypotheses including biomarkers in nutritional intervention studies.</p>
<p>Although relatively rare, pancreatic cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths and one whose incidence is increasing. In the United States, pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of cancer mortality. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the most common histologic type. There is no effective screening test for the malignancy; therefore, it is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, which contributes to its poor five-year survival rate of approximately 8.2%. Cigarette smoking, diabetes mellitus, and adiposity (overweight and obesity) are among the few consistent and modifiable risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Additional environmental and nutritional factors likely play a role; however, the evidence for specific exposures is often only suggestive due to the cancer&rsquo;s low incidence and inherent methodological issues related to collecting data for this rapidly fatal gastrointestinal cancer. PDAC cases often have gastrointestinal problems, weight loss, or diabetes prior to being diagnosed due to sub-clinical cancer which can influence dietary intake and biomarkers. Cohort studies with prediagnostic measures of exposures are less prone to these problems. Most of Dr. Stolzenberg-Solomon&rsquo;s research is conducted using prospective data and through pooled consortia efforts including the international <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=12&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=459581" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="459581" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276646" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="459581">Genome-wide Association Study of Pancreatic Cancer (PanScan)</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/publications/mpmono/">New Malignancies Among Cancer Survivors: SEER Cancer Registries, 1973-2000</a></h3>
<p class="first-graf">Ms. Curtis lead the development of a new NCI monograph published in 2006, which was the first to provide a comprehensive analysis of the risk of developing a new malignancy in the U.S. population. Many other studies have evaluated risk of subsequent cancers for individual cancer types or groups of cancers, usually related to the late effects of treatment, but this is the first report to provide a complete evaluation of subsequent cancer risk for most first primary cancer sites. The report utilized data from nine cancer registries participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from 1973 to 2000. The monograph is by far the largest study to date to assess risk of subsequent cancers and includes over 2 million cancer survivors over a nearly 30-year period, and over 185,000 subsequent primary cancers. More than 50 adult and 18 childhood cancers are included in the new report, including new data on less common cancer sites. Over 350 data tables present the risk of subsequent cancer by time since initial diagnosis, sex, age at initial diagnosis, and when appropriate, by treatment, and cancer cell type. Each chapter compares the findings with other studies, and discusses the results in terms of potential risk factors and mechanisms. Overall, cancer survivors were found to have a 14% increased risk of developing a subsequent primary cancer compared with that expected in the general population. Striking differences were seen by age, with a 6-fold increased risk observed for survivors of childhood cancer. In many cases, the patterns of excess risks that emerged suggested the effect of risk factors that are shared by the primary and subsequent cancers, or a carcinogenic effect of cancer therapies. The monograph provides a unique resource for clinicians, health professionals, and policy makers from which to evaluate the patterns of multiple cancers, and will be useful in advising cancer survivors on their long-term outcomes and the importance of medical supervision for prevention and early detection of new malignancies.</p>
<h3>Cancer Risk Following Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (HCT)</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Long-term survivors of allogeneic HCT are subject to the possible late effects of total-body irradiation combined with high-dose chemotherapy, and to the late complications of severe immune dysfunction. To quantify the risk of developing a new malignancy, a cohort of nearly 30,000 HCT recipients has been evaluated from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR) and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. Results to date have shown that transplant recipients have an increased risk of solid tumors that increases steeply over time; especially high risks were seen for the very young, underscoring the need for lifelong surveillance in this cohort. Recent results from this study show that the risk of non-squamous cell carcinoma cancers was strongly linked to radiation conditioning regimens received at a young age (and especially under 10 years of age), and that this risk increased with time since HCT (Blood 2009). In contrast, the risk of squamous cell cancers was related to chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) and male gender (Blood 2005, 2009). In the first study to fully assess the joint effects and interactions of multiple factors on risk of post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLD), Ms. Curtis and collaborators confirmed previous studies showing that the strongest risk factors were T-cell depletion through methods that selectively targeted T-cells and ATG given as prophylaxis of or treatment for GVHD (Blood 2009). In new findings, older age at transplantation (&gt;50 years) and the occurrence of a second transplant were strongly linked to increased risk of PTLD. A separate study conducted among recipients of autologous transplantation for lymphoma found that type and intensity of pre-transplant chemotherapy were important risk factors for the development of leukemic conditions (Blood 2003).</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Philip Rosenberg received a Ph.D. in biostatistics from Yale University. He joined the NCI as a Staff Fellow in 1988, and became a Senior Investigator within the Biostatistics Branch in 1997. Dr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s research focuses on advancing medical science by testing clinical, epidemiological, and biological hypotheses using state-of-the-art statistical methods. Dr. Rosenberg has received numerous awards for his work in biostatistics, including the Howard W. Temin Award for his contribution to the development of statistical methods to monitor trends in the HIV. He has received NIH Merit Awards for his collaborative work on inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, as well as for pioneering methods and software tools to identify candidate genes and pathways.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<h4>Risk Models for Inherited Bone Marrow Failure Syndromes</h4>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg has a special interest in rare cancers arising in the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, including Fanconi anemia (a disorder of DNA repair), severe congenital neutropenia (a disorder characterized by very low numbers of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that ingests harmful foreign particles, especially bacteria), and dyskeratosis congenita (a disorder of telomere maintenance).</p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg has developed and validated &lsquo;competing risks&rsquo; models for Fanconi anemia and severe congenital neutropenia. He and his colleagues continue to assess risks of solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia for these syndromes in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=26&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303691" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276650" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303691" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303691"></a>. Dr. Rosenberg has also expanded his work and is developing statistical models for other cancer predisposition syndromes, such as Dyskeratosis Congenita.</p>
<h4>Descriptive Epidemiology Studies</h4>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg is a co-principal investigator on a series of descriptive studies of breast cancer. Among these studies, he focuses on identifying secular trends in prognosis, underlying causes of racial disparity, and etiological heterogeneity of breast tumors. Dr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s novel statistical methods were also used to establish etiological heterogeneity within an array of different cancers, including hairy cell leukemia, Burkitt Lymphoma, and non-cardia gastric cancers.</p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg also works on developing new methods for cancer surveillance research, including novel methods based on the age-period-cohort model, proportional hazards models for comparative age-period-cohort analysis, and methods to forecast the future burden of cancer.</p>

<h4>Genetic and Environmental Epidemiology</h4>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg develops statistical approaches to analyze candidate genes and pathways. He is a collaborator on the population-based Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study, the Central and Eastern European Renal Cancer Study, and the Second Multicenter Hemophilia Cohort Study. For these studies, Dr. Rosenberg helps develop cutting-edge analytical methods and software tools to analyze SNPs in candidate genes and pathways and their associations to cancer. Some of the pathways that he and his colleagues are exploring include vitamin D metabolism, cell differentiation, apoptosis, and lipid peroxidation.</p>

<h2 id="biography"><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Beane Freeman received her doctorate in epidemiology from the University of Iowa in 2003 and completed postdoctoral training in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB). In 2009 she was appointed to the tenure track, and was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH in 2017. She is the NCI Principal Investigator of the Agricultural Health Study, the Early Life Exposures in Agriculture Study and the NCI Formaldehyde Industries cohort. Dr. Beane Freeman has received numerous awards recognizing her work, including two NCI Director&rsquo;s Innovation Awards, and the DCEG Mentoring Award. In 2016, Dr. Beane Freeman was elected to the Management Group of the International Epidemiology in Occupational Health (EPICOH) society.</p>
<h2 id="research"><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>The focus of Dr. Beane Freeman&rsquo;s work includes investigating cancer risk associated with a number of occupational and environmental exposures. Specifically, she conducts research related to the agricultural environment, including pesticides; industrial chemical exposures such as formaldehyde; and drinking water contaminants, such as disinfection by-products.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Exposures</h3>
<p>Studies around the world have observed that farmers and other agricultural workers are at elevated risk of several specific cancers, despite lower overall mortality and, in particular, cancer mortality. In this occupational group, excess risks are observed for Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, leukemia, multiple myeloma, and cancers of the brain, skin, lip, stomach, and prostate. Exposures suspected of contributing to the excesses include pesticides, viruses, mycotoxins, well-water contaminants, and a variety of other agents encountered in the agricultural environment.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303742" sys_contentid="303742" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7276811" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303742" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475">Agricultural Health Study</a> is a collaboration of the NCI, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the Environmental Protection Agency to evaluate agricultural exposures that may be related to cancer and other health outcomes. This prospective cohort study of approximately 90,000 participants includes licensed private pesticide applicators and their spouses in Iowa and North Carolina, and commercial applicators in Iowa.</p>
<p>In addition to pesticides, Dr. Beane Freeman is investigating other exposures within the agricultural environment such as exposure to livestock and poultry, diesel exhaust and endotoxins and other bioaerosols. There is increasing evidence that early life exposures may influence disease risk in adulthood. Therefore, she has initiated a study of offspring of the AHS participants to investigate how their childhood farm exposures may affect their health in later life. Finally, she is actively collaborating within the AGRICOH consortium, a collection of agricultural cohorts around the world, to replicate and extend a number of findings in the AHS.</p>
<h3>Formaldehyde</h3>
<p>Dr. Beane Freeman&rsquo;s research on formaldehyde exposure and cancer risk has focused on (1) whether occupational exposure to formaldehyde increases the risk of cancer at a number of sites, specifically the respiratory tract and lymphohematopoietic malignancies, and (2) the biologic plausibility of formaldehyde carcinogenicity, particularly at sites distant from the respiratory tract. She conducts this work within the NCI Cohort of Workers in Formaldehyde Industries, the largest study of occupationally exposed workers, including over 25,000 participants. The most recent follow-up on this study added another 10 years of mortality data, allowing sufficient person years to explore effects at different time periods and offered further insight into temporality of potential associations between formaldehyde and leukemia and other lymphohematopoietic malignancies.</p>
<h3>Drinking Water Contaminants</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Water disinfection&mdash;a public health triumph&mdash;reduces morbidity and mortality due to infectious disease. However, by-products resulting from the chemical reactions of disinfectants and organic matter in the water have been linked to increased risk of bladder cancer. This important public health concern raises many interesting and unresolved scientific questions related to the specific etiologic agents in the chemical mixture, as well as risks associated with route of exposure and overall exposure. To address these gaps, Dr. Beane Freeman leads ongoing&nbsp;investigations of bladder cancer risk using the most comprehensive exposure assessment of disinfection by-products to date.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Robert N. Hoover graduated from the University of Notre Dame (B.A.), Loyola University of Chicago (M.D.), and the Harvard School of Public Health (S.M.Hyg., Sc.D.). As Director of the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), he has established ongoing programs of research in various areas of cancer epidemiology, including descriptive studies, field studies in high-risk areas identified on the NCI cancer maps, occupational exposures, radiation, studies of medicinal agents, diet and nutrition, viral studies, general environmental exposures, tobacco use and lifestyle factors, immunoepidemiology, genetic susceptibility, and gene-environment interactions. A special focus of his work has been in the area of hormonal carcinogenesis. Dr. Hoover is widely recognized as one of the nation's leading cancer epidemiologists. In recognition of his outstanding scientific achievements, he has received several honors, including the Abraham Lilienfeld Award from the American College of Epidemiology, the John Snow Award from the American Public Health Association, the American Association of Cancer Research-American Cancer Society Award for Research Excellence in Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention, the Distinguished Service Medal from the U.S. Public Health Service, the Gorgas Medal from the Association of Military Surgeons of the United States, the&nbsp;Cutter Lecture on Preventive Medicine at the Harvard School of Public Health, and the Robert S. Gordon Award Lecture at the National Institutes of Health for distinguished achievements in epidemiology.</p>
<h2>DES Follow-up Study</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Since 1992, Dr. Hoover, other NCI investigators, and collaborators from five field study centers have been actively following diethylstilbestrol (DES) -exposed and -unexposed mothers, daughters and sons, and granddaughters for adverse health effects resulting from this exposure. As DES-exposed offspring are currently reaching the age when cancer rates begin to rise, it is important to continue to monitor long-term risk of cancer and other adverse health outcomes in this unique population. The study also provides a model for assessing a number of hypotheses that address concerns about prenatal hormonal influences on disease risk, both an intriguing area of science and an increasingly controversial environmental issue that affects a substantial proportion of the population.<br /><br />To date the study has identified excess female breast cancer after age 40 that shows a dose-response effect, as well as increased risk for high-grade lesions of the cervix and vagina. Concern over other hormone-related cancers remains; though to date analyses have been limited due to small numbers of cases. In the sons, investigators observed an excess risk for urogenital anomalies and infertility, and a likely excess of testicular cancer. To examine the effects in the third generation (the daughters of the prenatally exposed daughters), investigators assembled a small cohort in 2000. Given their average age, there have been few relevant disease outcomes. However, investigators noted an elevated risk for infertility&mdash;though not statistically significant, this outcome was also seen in DES-daughters. In addition, there were three cases of ovarian cancer in the granddaughters, even though substantially less than one had been expected. While both of these observations remain difficult to interpret, they have added some urgency to expand the cohort and continue to follow-up. <a href="http://www.desfollowupstudy.org/index.asp">More on the DES Follow-up Study</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Joseph Fraumeni received an A.B. degree from Harvard College, an M.D. from Duke University, and an M.Sc. in epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health. After completing a medical residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, he joined the Epidemiology Branch of the National Cancer Institute as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service in 1962.&nbsp; He became head of the Ecology Studies Section in 1966, Chief of the Environmental Epidemiology Branch in 1975, Director of the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program in 1979, and founding Director of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics in 1995. He retired in 2017 and was named Scientist Emeritus. Dr. Fraumeni has authored or co-authored more than 900 scientific publications, and was an editor with David Schottenfeld of the first three editions of <em>Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention,</em> Oxford University Press.</p>
<p>In recognition of his research accomplishments, Dr. Fraumeni has received numerous honors, including the Abraham Lilienfeld Award from the American College of Epidemiology, John Snow Award from the American Public Health Association, James D. Bruce Award from the American College of Physicians, Nathan Davis Award from the American Medical Association, Charles S. Mott Prize from the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation, Medal of Honor from the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the American Cancer Society, as well as a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Association for Cancer Research. Recently, the American Society of Preventive Oncology renamed its Distinguished Career Achievement Award as the Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., Award for Distinguished Achievement. Dr. Fraumeni is also an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Medicine, the Association of American Physicians, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<h2><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Over a career spanning more than 50 years at NIH, Dr. Fraumeni shaped and directed a national and international research program designed to identify the environmental and genetic determinants of cancer and the means of prevention. His personal research focused on genetic susceptibility to cancer, particularly by investigating familial aggregations of various malignancies. Most notable was his discovery in 1969, with fellow NCI researcher Frederick P. Li, of a rare, inherited syndrome featuring an array of multiple cancers in young people that came to be known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. This observation eventually led to collaborative molecular studies that uncovered inherited mutations in the <em>TP53</em> tumor suppressor gene.</p>
<p>Another theme of Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s research has been the search for lifestyle and other environmental causes of cancer. In 1975, he led the development of the first in a series of computer-generated maps depicting the geographic variation of U.S. cancer mortality at the county level. This work allowed Dr. Fraumeni and his colleagues to identify previously undetected exposures driving the distinctive patterns of certain malignancies, such as lung, oral, and bladder cancers, followed by preventive interventions in high-risk populations. This strategy was later applied in China, where a series of collaborative studies were conducted in areas with exceptionally high mortality from esophageal, stomach, lung, and other cancers.</p>
<p>Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s more recent work has centered on the integration of genomic, metabolomic and other high-throughput technologies in large-scale consortial studies with replication strategies designed to identify with some precision the carcinogenic risks and biological underpinnings that may inform new clinical and public health interventions.</p>

<p id="research">A major focus of Dr. Mbulaiteye&rsquo;s research is to characterize the epidemiology of Burkitt lymphoma (BL). In western countries, where BL occurs sporadically, Dr. Mbulaiteye has used registry-based datasets to investigate age-specific incidence rates for BL and adduce evidence for disease heterogeneity. The results from these studies suggest that that the etiology of sporadic BL may vary with age. In sub-Saharan Africa, where BL is the most common childhood tumor, Dr. Mbulaiteye seeks to quantify the association between markers of current or past malarial&nbsp;infection (parasite prevalence, load, and genotype, antibodies to malaria virulent antigens, and history of clinical malaria), and markers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection (antibodies or EBV variants) with BL. In addition, Dr. Mbulaiteye is investigating the role of systemic magnesium as a geographical co-factor associated with poor control of EBV and BL risk.</p>
<p id="research">To achieve these goals, Dr. Mbulaiteye implemented a case-control study of BL called the <a href="https://emblem.cancer.gov/">Epidemiology of Burkitt Lymphoma in East-African Children and Minors</a> (EMBLEM) in six rural regions in Uganda, Tanzania, and Kenya. This study addresses a major constraint that was hampering Dr. Mulaiteye&rsquo;s BL research: lack of access to high-quality data and annotated samples from BL patients, due either to depletion or unsuitability of historic samples for use with current proteomic and molecular technologies. The primary scientific goals of EMBLEM are to investigate the molecular characterization of BL and associations of BL with: a) malaria resistance genes, assuming the Mendelian randomization (MR) principle; b) EBV genetic variants; and c) germline variants in a genome-wide association study (GWAS).</p>
<h3 id="research">HIV/AIDS and Cancer</h3>
<p>Dr. Mbulaiteye was the first to use record-linkage methods to investigate the association between HIV and cancer in a low- and middle-income country (LMIC) with his study conducted in Uganda in 2005. He has since extended these methods to Nigeria and India. Dr. Mbulaiteye continues to support and advise other investigators who wish to use these methods to generate new data about the impact of HIV and cancer in LMICs.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Greene received a B.A. (English) from Yale College, an M.D. from Tufts University, and completed his training in Internal Medicine at the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. He spent three years with the Epidemic Intelligence Service of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and then came to the National Cancer Institute in 1975 as a Staff Fellow in the Environmental Epidemiology Branch. Dr. Greene completed his medical oncology fellowship at the Medicine Branch, NCI, and is board-certified in both Internal Medicine and Medical Oncology. In 1977, he became a Senior Investigator and, subsequently, Coordinator of Family Studies within the Environmental Epidemiology Branch (EEB). In 1984, Dr. Greene was appointed Deputy Branch Chief of EEB. In 1985, he left government service to enter the private practice of medical oncology and hematology in Sun City, Arizona. In 1991, he joined the faculty of Mayo Clinic Scottsdale as a Professor of Oncology in the Mayo Medical School. While at Mayo, he was a participating investigator with a variety of cooperative oncology groups, including NCCTG, ECOG and NSABP. Dr. Greene became the Principal Investigator for the Mayo Cancer Center&rsquo;s Familial Cancer Program in 1994. In the fall of 1999, he returned to NCI as the Branch Chief of the newly-created Clinical Genetics Branch. Dr. Greene served as Branch Chief until 2013, and continues to direct studies as a senior investigator within the branch. His major research interests are familial/hereditary cancers, genetic determinants of outcomes following cancer treatment, as well as intervention studies (cancer screening, surgical risk reduction and chemoprevention) in genetically at-risk populations, genetic modifiers of cancer risk, and leveraging alert clinical observations into novel etiologic insights.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p class="first-graf">With the discovery of many of the genes underlying the hereditary components of the common adult malignancies (<cite>i.e.</cite>, <cite>BRCA1/2</cite> in hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, the mismatch repair genes in HNPCC, the <cite>CDKN2A</cite> gene in hereditary melanoma, <cite>etc.</cite>), the molecular biology of familial cancer has challenged our ability to manage germline mutation carriers in an effective, evidence-based fashion. Clinicians and patients alike are have worked together to take advantage of these molecular breakthroughs, and the past decade has witnessed major improvements in evidence-based approaches to the management of high-risk individuals, but important questions remain. The Clinical Genetics Branch focuses its resources on acquiring the data needed to address these issues, both for rare, highly-penetrant genes and common, lower penetrance genes, which contribute to the development of cancer in humans.</p>
<h3>The National Ovarian Cancer Prevention and Early Detection Study (GOG-0199)</h3>
<p>This is Dr. Greene&rsquo;s major research initiative. GOG-0199 is a two-arm, prospective, nonrandomized natural history study of women at increased genetic risk of ovarian cancer. It is a unique collaborative undertaking between NCI&rsquo;s Intramural Research Program (DCEG Clinical Genetics Branch), Extramural Research Program (DCP CCOP Program; DCTD CTEP Program), the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG), and the NCI-sponsored Cancer Genetics Network (CGN). He is comparing women who elect risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) to those who choose to participate in a pilot study of a novel ovarian cancer screening strategy (the &ldquo;Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm,&rdquo; aka &lsquo;ROCA&rsquo;). The study closed to accrual in November 2007, after 5 years&rsquo; prospective follow-up, having enrolled 1000 women in the RRSO arm and 1600 women in the screening arm. Final data form retrieval, data QC and analytic database construction are underway, to permit analysis of Primary Study Endpoints, which include comparisons of the cancer incidence, medical decision-making, quality of life, and performance characteristics of the ROCA algorithm between the two study arms. The <i>BRCA</i> mutation status of all subjects has been defined (mutation-negative/family history-positive women were eligible for this study), and central review of the surgical specimens from all baseline risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomies has been completed. We have also assembled a meticulously-annotated biospecimen repository to support diverse translational research endpoints.</p>
<p>The current translational research focus for GOG-0199 relates to our active membership in CIMBA (Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of <i>BRCA1/2</i>), an international consortium of 30 research groups which has assembled a collection of 30,000 <i>BRCA</i> mutation carriers to conduct adequately-powered analyses of candidate genetic modifiers and related genomic research. He has co-authored 31 publications through this collaboration. Ongoing analyses include (1) performance characteristics of the ROCA screening algorithm (GOG + CGN); (2) histopathology of 1,000 RRSO surgical specimens (both ovaries and fallopian tubes); (3) factors influencing the choice between RRSO and screening among high-risk women; and (4) baseline quality-of-life profiles of women electing RRSO and screening.</p>
<h3>Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer (HBOC)</h3>
<p class="first-graf">This syndrome has been under active investigation within the Division for the past 40 years. The long-term clinical follow-up of a cohort of 60 HBOC families, 33 of which have deleterious <cite>BRCA1/2</cite> mutations, has provided a basis for ongoing CGB research targeting HBOC. Currently, enrollment of new subjects into active clinical research protocols has ended, with the exceptions of our behavioral studies targeting the needs of young (less than 30 years old) <cite>BRCA 1/2</cite> mutation carriers (NCI Protocol 09-C-N074). Analysis of data collected under prior HBOC-related projects (Protocols 01-C-0009; 02-C-0212; 02-C-0268) continues. Combining DNA samples and clinical data from the various HBOC studies (Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer protocol, HBOC Breast Imaging protocol, and GOG-0199), we have contributed &gt; 1,100 subjects to the collaborative analyses being conducted by the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of <cite>BRCA1/2</cite> (CIMBA). Nearly 35 publications have resulted from this effort to date. <b>This protocol has closed to new patient accrual</b>, but translational analyses continue, utilizing the carefully-annotated biospecimens which have been collected from these study populations.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Familial Testicular Cancer (FTC)</h3>
<p class="first-graf">The mapping of a familial testicular cancer susceptibility gene to chromosome Xq27, and the initiation of a major new DCEG testicular cancer case-control study resulted in CGB re-activating DCEG's Familial Testicular Cancer Study. We joined the International Testicular Cancer Linkage Consortium (ITCLC), and contributed DNA and clinical data from our multiple-case families to the FTC cancer susceptibility gene mapping and positional cloning effort. Standard linkage analysis failed to corroborate the Xq27 locus finding, and further suggested that the genetic basis for FTC may represent the combined effects of multiple low-penetrance genes, rather than a classical, single highly-penetrant gene. We are bringing selected testicular cancer families to the NIH Clinical Center for more detailed etiologic studies [NCI Protocol 02-C-0178]. CGB is taking the lead in performing an expert, central pathology review comparing familial with sporadic testicular cancers, and quantitatively analyzing the occurrence of malignancies other than testicular cancer in the ITCLC family set [NCI Protocol 04-C-N076]. The relationship between testicular microlithiasis and FTC risk is the current clinical focus of this project. We are also leveraging the biospecimens collected from multiple-case family members and their relatives to pursue in greater depth the recent genomewide association study results, which have identified a number of genes involved in testicular embryogenesis and fertility as strong candidate risk factors. We have demonstrated that the same genes implicated as genetic modifiers of sporadic testicular cancer risk also contribute to the risk of familial testicular cancer, and have contributed our DNA samples to an international GWAS meta-analysis which has identified 5 new genomic regions as important modifiers of testicular cancer risk.</p>
<h3>Myotonic Dystrophy (DM)</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Based on the clinical impression developed by neurologists responsible for the management of DM that their patients were developing more cancer than expected, we have become involved in trying to answer the question &ldquo;Is myotonic dystrophy a cancer susceptibility disorder?&rdquo; Initial results of our first quantitative analysis &ndash; based upon data obtained from population-based diagnosis and cancer registries, in collaboration with investigators in Sweden and Denmark &ndash; the answer appears to be &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; We have identified a highly-significant, two-fold increase in the risk of all cancers combined &ndash; an excess accounted for by cancers of the colon, endometrium, ovary and brain &ndash; among DM patients. Subsequent reports have suggested that persons with Type 1 DM are twice as likely as those with Type 2 to report a personal history of cancer, that there is no clear correlation between trinucleotide repeat length in DM1, and that the cumulative burden of cancer among DM patients is substantial. Additional work is ongoing to refine and clarify this novel observation.</p>
<h3>Genetic Polymorphisms as Determinants of Outcomes of Cancer Therapy</h3>
<p class="first-graf">DCEG has a long and distinguished history of investigating the relationship between treatments administered to patients to control an initial cancer, and the risk of subsequently developing a second cancer. This represents a unique situation in which one can study the consequences of human exposure to well defined chemical carcinogens and ionizing radiation. The opportunity exists to move these studies into the genetic arena, by investigating the relationship between common polymorphisms in genes affecting the bioavailability of chemical carcinogens and various outcomes of clinical interest. Such studies could identify population sub-groups which are at particular risk of second cancers, thrombotic events, acute myelosuppression, response to treatment or even survival. Information of this kind could have a significant impact on clinical decision-making. CGB's first foray into this arena - a study of <b>genetic polymorphisms in the genes related to tamoxifen and estrogen bioavailability and the risk of breast cancer as a result of tamoxifen exposure</b> &ndash; and it provided interesting leads related to <cite>CYP2D6</cite>, a gene involved in the metabolism of tamoxifen, and breast cancer risk.</p>
<p class="first-graf">Our ongoing study of <b>genetic polymorphisms in genes from the IGF signaling pathway</b> represents another variation on the theme of common variants within less penetrant genes as modifiers of cancer risk is Elevated levels of IGF1, a cytokine with both mitogenic and anti-apoptotic effects, have been associated with increased risks of a variety of different cancers. In collaboration with NCI&rsquo;s Core Genotyping Facility and investigators from DCEG&rsquo;s Biostatistics and Occupational/Environmental Epidemiology Branches, genetic variations in 8 genes within this signaling pathway have been identified, and are now being analyzed as determinants of advanced colorectal adenoma risk among participants of the Prostate, Lung, Colon and Ovarian Cancer screening trial. Circulating levels of IGF1, IGF2 and IGF-BP3 are also being evaluated in this nested case-control study. The first report from this project documents an increased risk of advanced colorectal adenoma in persons with the highest circulating levels of IGF1.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Behavioral, Counseling and Psychosocial Implications Related to Being at Increased Genetic Risk of Developing Cancer</h3>
<p>Dr. Greene has implemented a strategy of actively seeking opportunities to investigate the genetic counseling, behavioral and psychosocial implications of being at increased genetic risk of cancer, since the Branch&rsquo;s inception. This is accomplished through selective incorporation of such research into our new and ongoing clinical research projects. Many of our staff (medical and pediatric oncologists, clinical geneticist, oncology genetic counselor, cancer genetics research nurse, and a marriage and family therapist) have unique training, interests and perspectives relative to this research domain, which is further supplemented by collaborations with senior behavioral research colleagues from other NIH divisions, and post-doctoral fellows (including NCI Cancer Prevention Fellows), Division of Cancer Control and Population Studies (DCCPS) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). Since CGB began operations 12 years ago, this activity has yielded nearly 50 publications. Projects that currently fall within this domain include (1) the ongoing development of the CEGRM (Colored Ecogenetics Relationship Map), a novel counseling tool aimed at identifying sources of social support; (2) a series of analyses focused on the lives of young <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutation carriers; (3) analyses of surgical decision-making and the influence of test ambiguity on screening behavior among <i>BRCA</i> mutation carriers; (4) a comprehensive set of psychosocial/behavioral analyses, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, among GOG-0199 study participants; and (5) initiation of data collection in our newest clinical research protocol, which targets the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Ethel S. Gilbert received a B.A. in mathematics from Oberlin College and an M.P.H. and Ph. D. in biostatistics from the University of Michigan. She spent several years as a senior staff scientist at Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, where her research focused on epidemiologic studies of nuclear workers and on analyzing data from experimental animal studies, and also spent a year at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Hiroshima, Japan. Dr. Gilbert joined the NCI in 1996 as an Expert and received the NIH Merit Award in 2003. Dr. Gilbert is a fellow of the American Statistical Association and an honorary member of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements. She was a member of the National Academy of Sciences BEIR VII Committee on Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, and was also a member of the study group for the 15-country nuclear worker study. Dr. Gilbert became a special volunteer in 2018.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<ul class="grey-bullets">
<li>Evaluating carcinogenic risk from protracted radiation exposure in nuclear workers including those at the Mayak nuclear facility in the Russian Federation</li>
<li>Developing risk models for estimating the carcinogenic risk from exposure to radiation</li>
<li>Analyzing data from both case-control and cohort studies of second cancers after radiotherapy and chemotherapy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Nuclear Worker Studies</h3>
<p class="first-graf">In most countries, exposure to nuclear workers has been deliberately limited as a protection to the worker. Thus, studies of these workers offer a direct assessment of risks from exposure to radiation at low doses and dose rates, and provide a check on A-bomb survivor-based estimates that form the basis of radiation protection standards. I have served on the main study group and also on the epidemiology and dosimetry subgroups for the planning and implementing of the 15-country nuclear worker study, which combined data on about 400,000 nuclear workers in 15 countries. Risk estimates for leukemia (excluding chronic lymphatic leukemia) and all cancers excluding leukemias were compatible with those that provide the basis for radiation protection standards, but confidence intervals were wide.</p>
<p>In collaboration with Russian scientists, NCI is conducting epidemiologic studies of workers at the Mayak weapons production plant in the South Ural Mountains in the Russian Federation. These studies provide information on protracted radiation exposure at much larger doses than in worker studies in other countries, and also provide the only reliable direct information on risks from plutonium exposure. Dose-response relationships for exposure to plutonium were demonstrated for mortality from cancers of the lung, liver, and bone, the three major sites of plutonium deposition. Dose-response relationships for external radiation exposure were demonstrated for mortality from leukemia; lung cancer, and all cancers other than lung, liver, and bone cancer. Further analyses of other site-specific cancers are underway.</p>
<h3>Radiation Risk Assessment</h3>
<p class="first-graf">I have been involved in several efforts to estimate radiation risks and their dependence on dose, gender, age, and other factors. These include serving as a member of the National Research Council&rsquo;s BEIR VI Committee (concerned with risks from exposure to radon), of the National Research Council&rsquo;s BEIR VII Committee (concerned with low dose exposure to low-LET radiation), and of the NCI-CDC Working Group to revise the 1985 NIH Radioepidemiological Tables.</p>
<h3>Second Cancer Studies</h3>
<p class="first-graf">I have analyzed data from both cohort and case-control studies to evaluate risk of second cancers in cancer survivors. In an international case-control study of lung cancer following Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), lung cancer risk increased with both increasing radiation dose, and with increasing number of cycles of chemotherapy involving alkylating agents. In addition, the combined effects of radiation dose and therapy with alkylating agents were estimated to be almost exactly additive whereas the combined effect of radiation and smoking was better described by a multiplicative relationship. In a similarly designed international case-control study of breast cancer following HL that was diagnosed under age 30, risk increased with increasing radiation dose, but treatment with either alkylating agent chemotherapy or receiving a dose to the ovaries that exceeded 5 Gy reduced both the overall risk of breast cancer and the slope of the radiation dose-response. I have also analyzed data from cohort studies of both testicular cancer and HL survivors. Although these cohorts lack detailed treatment information, they provide information on which site-specific cancers show elevated rates, and also on the temporal patterns of risk and the dependence of risk on sex, age at exposure, and attained age. I am currently involved in planning and analysis for an international study of second primary gastrointestinal cancers among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the testis, breast, and cervix.</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Friesen received a Ph.D. (2006) and M.Sc. (2001) in occupational hygiene from the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada. She completed postdoctoral studies at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, and at the University of California at Berkeley. She joined the NCI as a tenure-track investigator in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch in June 2009, and was awarded NIH scientific tenure and promoted to senior investigator in 2017.</p>
<h2 id="research"><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Friesen's research has focused on quantitative assessment strategies to minimize exposure misclassification in occupational epidemiologic studies. She has focused on improving exposure estimates, evaluating the robustness of exposure-response relationships to exposure assessment strategies, and using statistical models for both developing exposure metrics and evaluating their exposure-response relationships. By using more refined and more proximal exposure measures, her research has resulted in quantitative exposure-response relationships for several exposure-disease associations that have not previously been published.</p>
<h4>Decision Rule and Measurement-based Approaches</h4>
<p>In OEEB, Dr. Friesen focuses her research on&nbsp;developing transparent measurement- and decision rule-based methods to assess occupational exposure in case-control studies and population-based cohorts. Exposure assessment in these studies relies heavily on subject-reported information and the professional judgment of exposure assessors. She has demonstrated that decision-rule based approaches that link questionnaire response patterns to exposure decisions are comparable to the estimates from a traditional job-by-job expert review and can replicate the average rating from a team of experts. She has also developed a method to use data mining methods (e.g. classification trees, CT) to extract underlying (but not explicitly stated) decision rules from the relationship between exposure estimates derived from professional judgment and questionnaire responses. The resulting CT decision trees extract the valuable information from previous assessments and thus allow the decision rules to be used to estimate exposure in other studies with similar exposure information. As a result, exposure assessors can focus their attention on the exposure scenarios identified by the CT model as being difficult to assess and on scenarios that were not covered by the decision rules. To continue efficiently using teams of experts, she led the development of source-specific decision rules for estimating historical lead and benzene for US case-control studies. Developing decision rules removes the assessment from its much criticized &lsquo;black box&rsquo; and facilitates future exposure assessment efforts that can apply the rules. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p>A crucial component the decision rule exposure estimation process is to anchor the intensity estimates to a concentration scale. Dr. Friesen has extended the use of statistical models that are commonly used in industry-based studies to predict historical exposure to population-based studies using publicly available data from the literature and measurements collected during health and safety inspections. For example, she has developed a framework to combine subjective ratings of exposure from job exposure matrices (JEMs) and exposure measurements to better discriminate between time and job differences in exposure levels in population-based studies. In addition, she was the first to apply meta-regression models in summary statistics extracted from the published literature for both occupational and environmental exposures to identify determinants of exposure. She has now used this modeling approach to identify determinants of multiple exposures, including lead, benzene, and pesticides.<o:p></o:p></p>
<h4>Automated Methods to Process Free-text Responses</h4>
<p>Dr. Friesen also develops exposure assessment tools to facilitate the use of occupational risk factor data in epidemiologic studies by efficiently transforming the verbatim participants&rsquo; responses from occupational questionnaires into usable data. She led the development of an algorithm, <a href="http://soccer.nci.nih.gov">SOCcer (Standardized Occupation Coding for Computer-assisted Epidemiological Research</a>), to automatically code job descriptions into standardized occupation classification (SOC) codes. She also developed a keyword-based approach to use the verbatim responses to systematically extract variables representing exposure scenarios that can be used in decision rules.</p>
<h4>Gender Differences in Exposure</h4>
<p>During the Environmental Exposures and Women's Health seminar series held on October 5, 2010, Dr. Friesen discussed the importance of examining cancer risk separately in men and women. Specifically, she focused on sex differences in the accuracy of exposure assessment tools for epidemiologic studies. <a href="http://videocast.nih.gov/Summary.asp?File=16180&amp;start=4503">View Dr. Friesen's presentation, &ldquo;Women are not just small men&rdquo;</a>. In analyses pooling occupational responses from three OEEB studies, she found gender differences in the prevalence and frequency of work tasks. These differences would result in exposure misclassification if these work task differences are not considered and demonstrate the need for incorporating job modules to capture individual-level occupational information.&nbsp;More recently, she led the development of an algorithm to assess non-occupational pesticide exposure for the spouses of farmers in the Agricultural Health Study. The resulting algorithm estimates will be crucial for future evaluations of whether the health risks observed in the male farmers are also seen in women and evaluating risks for female-specific cancer sites.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Graubard received a Ph.D. in mathematics from the University of Maryland in 1991. He began his career as a mathematical statistician at the National Center for Health Statistics in 1977, and held research positions at the Alcohol Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration and the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. Dr. Graubard joined the NCI in 1990. He received the American Statistical Association and Biometric Society Snedecor Award for Applied Statistical Research in 1990, and he is a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and of the Statistics Section of the American Association for the Advancement of Science.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Dr. Graubard&rsquo;s research interests are primarily in the development and application of statistical methods to efficiently design and analyze studies that make valid inferences to well-defined target populations. These types of studies often collect data using complex sample designs that randomly sample individuals using stratified and multistage cluster sampling. National cross-sectional health surveys and population-based study designs such as case-control studies that sample population controls from the population at risk becoming diseased and case-cohort or nested cohort studies that subsample from a cohort can use complex sample designs. In addition, national health surveys link the participants to vital statistics or electronic medical records to form population representative cohorts to study disease etiology.&nbsp; When analyzing data from these types of studies attention needs to be given to the complex sample design because the sample weights that reflect the differential rates of selection of study participants and the stratification and clustering of the sampling that are used efficient data collection can affect the estimation of prevalence, incidence and risk factor associations of diseases and the variances in analyses. A large part of Dr. Graubard&rsquo;s research involves the integration of survey methods to develop statistical methods for efficiently using complex sample designs in cancer surveillance and epidemiology.</p>
<h3>Areas of Statistical Methods Research</h3>
<ul>
<li>Augmenting existing samples to address new hypotheses.</li>
<li>Combining surveys with cohorts, vital statistics, cancer registries and electronic medical records to improve population representativeness of inferences. &nbsp;</li>
<li>Developing and evaluating disease and mortality absolute risk models with probability and nonprobability samples.</li>
<li>Inferring health and risk factor disparities between advantaged and disadvantaged groups using national surveys.</li>
<li>Conducting efficient inferences for genetic data from complex samples.</li>
<li>Protecting anonymity of participant&rsquo;s measurements in complex samples.</li>
<li>Estimation and inference of family aggregation of phenotypes from network sampling in national surveys.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Collaborative Epidemiological and Surveillance Studies</h3>
<p>Dr. Graubard collaborates with epidemiologists and other public health researchers on the designs and analyses of a wide range of epidemiologic studies. &nbsp;A large number of these collaborations use the National Health and Nutrition and Examination Survey (NHANES), National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the Behavior Risk Factor Survey (BRFS).&nbsp; For instance, Dr. Graubard with his collaborators have used NHANES to study prevalence of human papillomavirus (HPV) and its oncologic subtypes and factors related to increased risk of prevalent HPV, prevalence of monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), an associated precursor to multiple myeloma (MM), &nbsp;dietary consumption of food and beverages and nutrition-related biomarkers in relation to development of obesity and chronic disease incidence and all-cause and cause-specific mortality for cancer cardiovascular and other diseases. In addition, they have used the NHIS to study trends in alcohol consumption among the elderly population, trends in race/ethnic disparity in cancer screening, and with NHANES and BRFFS to study trends in physical activity among the elderly.</p>

<h2 id="biography"><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Berndt received a Pharm.D. from the University of Michigan, and a Ph.D. in epidemiology from Johns Hopkins University. She joined DCEG in 2003 as a pre-doctoral fellow, becoming a post-doctoral fellow in 2006 within the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch. In 2009, Dr. Berndt was appointed to the position of tenure-track investigator. She was awarded scientific tenure and promoted to senior investigator in March 2017. She has received several awards for her work, including an NCI Intramural Research Award, NCI Director&rsquo;s Career Development Award, and several DCEG and NIH Fellowship Achievement awards for excellence in research.</p>
<h2 id="research"><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Berndt&rsquo;s research utilizes new analytic methods in genetic and molecular epidemiology to elucidate &nbsp;the etiology of cancer and anthropometric traits and explores the impact of modifiable risk factors on cancer risk and mortality. She co-leads several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and the PLCO Prostate Cancer Progression (PCP) Study. She is a member of the InterLymph Consortium Coordinating Committee and serves as the principal investigator representing the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial for the Genetic Investigation of Anthropometric Traits (GIANT), Prostate Cancer Association Group to Investigate Cancer Associated Alterations in the Genome (PRACTICAL), African American Prostate Cancer (AAPC), Genetics and Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer Consortium (GECCO), and <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> Colorectal Cancer (HpCRC) consortia.</p>
<h3><strong>Lymphoid Malignancies</strong></h3>
<p>Genetic, environmental, and immune-related factors have been implicated in the etiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), but the complex etiology of this disease is not well understood. To elucidate the genetic underpinnings of common NHL subtypes, Dr. Berndt co-led a large multicenter genome-wide association study (GWAS) for NHL and identified over 30 new independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with specific subtypes of NHL, more than doubling the number of identified loci for NHL and discovering a key role for apoptosis in CLL susceptibility. She is currently expanding the GWAS to include additional rare and common lymphoid malignancies. The expanded GWAS will double the sample size for discovery and lead to further exploration of the genetic architecture of lymphoid malignancies. Her research also uses next generation sequencing and bioinformatic tools to fine-map discovered risk loci and molecular technologies to further understand potential biological mechanisms.</p>
<h3><strong>Prostate Cancer</strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>Both environmental and genetic factors are thought to contribute to the risk of prostate cancer. Over the past decade, through the work of Dr. Berndt and others, substantial progress has been made in identifying genetic loci associated with the risk of prostate cancer with over 150 loci discovered to date. Dr. Berndt&rsquo;s research seeks to understand the genetic architecture of prostate cancer susceptibility, explore potential effect modification by environmental and occupational risk factors, and examine how these factors may be used in risk prediction and screening for prostate cancer. Although prostate cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world, only a small proportion of men die from the disease. Understanding and predicting which men are likely to die from the disease is of clinical importance to prevent overtreatment. Dr. Berndt co-leads a study of prostate cancer progression within the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial, which seeks to identify environmental, lifestyle and molecular risk factors for disease progression.</p>
</div>
<h3 class="dceg-bio-content">Anthropometric Traits</h3>
<div class="dceg-bio-content">
<p class="first-graf">Although the biological mechanisms are not well understood, obesity and height are risk factors for several cancers. Both anthropometric traits have strong genetic components. Through the GIANT Consortium, Dr. Berndt and colleagues have identified hundreds of loci for height and adiposity-related traits (e.g., body mass index). This work has a had profound impact on our understanding of the genetic architecture of these traits as well as other diseases, but many questions remain. Dr. Berndt&rsquo;s research seeks to further understand the genetic underpinnings of anthropometric traits and to examine the impact of adiposity on cancer risk and mortality.</p>

</ul>
<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Hildesheim received his Ph.D. in epidemiology from The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1991 and has been at the NCI since 1987. He was Chief of the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch from 2008&ndash;2017. Dr. Hildesheim's research focuses on understanding host and viral factors involved in the pathogenesis of DNA virus-related tumors and in translating etiological findings to practical public health measures aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality associated with virus-related tumors.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Hildesheim conducts large-scale population studies to investigate exogenous and host factors involved in the pathogenesis of DNA virus-related tumors. He investigates two groups of tumors&mdash;nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC) linked to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and female gynecological cancers linked to human papillomavirus (HPV). Both viral and non-viral factors hypothesized to be involved in the pathogenesis of EBV- and HPV-related cancers are examined, since infection alone is rarely sufficient for the development of cancer. Dr. Hildesheim is also the co-lead on studies to evaluate the long-term impact of HPV vaccination and the immunological markers of long-term vaccine efficacy.</p>
<h3><strong>Nasopharyngeal Cancer</strong></h3>
<p class="first-graf">Nasopharyngeal cancer has a very distinct geographic and ethnic distribution, occurring at high rates among ethnic Chinese from southeastern China and at much lower rates among Caucasians. While infection with EBV is believed to be necessary for development of the cancer, both genetic and exogenous factors are also thought to be important. Dr. Hildesheim is the lead NCI investigator on several studies of NPC in Taiwan and collaborates with investigators in China and other countries on studies of NPC.&nbsp; His recent focus in this area has been on the evaluation of EBV-based markers that might be useful to risk stratify individuals at high risk of familial and sporadic NPC and to better understand specific genetic factors associated with the development of NPC.</p>
<h3>HPV Vaccines</h3>
<p>HPV vaccines designed to prevent infection and associated lesions associated with oncogenic HPV types 16 and 18 have been licensed in many countries. These vaccines have the potential to profoundly impact cervical cancer prevention strategies, and if applied wisely, to reach underserved populations that have historically not benefited from secondary prevention programs based on Pap smears. Dr. Hildesheim is the co-lead NCI investigator on a 7,465 women community-based HPV 16/18 vaccine trial in Costa Rica. Initiated in 2004, this trial is designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the HPV 16/18 vaccine, to examine broader questions of long-term population impact of vaccination, and to explore cost-effective ways in which HPV-based vaccination and screening might be applied in the future. The trial involves active follow-up of participants and includes a rich biological specimen collection component that allows for the added evaluation of numerous scientific questions of etiological and immunological interest.</p>
<p>Dr. Hildesheim is also a co-investigator on a 24,000 women community-based trial underway in Costa Rica to formally evaluate whether a single dose of two commercially available vaccines (GARDASIL<sup>&reg;</sup> 9 and Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup>) is non-inferior to a multi-dose regimen for these same vaccines. The results of this later trial have the potential to simplify HPV vaccine delivery programs, thereby making cervical cancer control more achievable in low resource countries with high cervical cancer burden.</p>

<h2 id="Biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Britton Trabert earned her M.S.P.H. in epidemiology from Emory University, her M.S. in biostatistics from the University of Michigan, and her Ph.D. in epidemiology from the University of Washington with a focus in reproductive epidemiology and women&rsquo;s health. She joined the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) as a Sallie Rosen Kaplan Postdoctoral Fellow in 2009, was promoted to research fellow in 2011, and was appointed as an Earl Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator in 2014. Her research interests concentrate on the epidemiology of hormonally-related malignancies, specifically two areas: 1) the epidemiology of ovarian cancer and 2) the hormonal etiology of female cancers. Dr. Trabert has received numerous awards for her work, including the NCI Director&rsquo;s Innovation Award and NIH Fellows Award for Research Excellence.</p>
<h2 id="Research">Research Interests</h2>
<h3><b>Ovarian Cancer Epidemiology</b></h3>
<p>Until recently, scientists theorized that ovarian cancer arose from 1) microtrauma to the ovarian epithelium (outer layer) resulting from uninterrupted ovulation and 2) exposure to high levels of gonadotropin&mdash;a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates the ovaries. Over the last decade, the understanding of the origin of ovarian cancer has changed dramatically. Morphologic and molecular studies now suggest that many high-grade serous tumors&mdash;the most common and lethal subtype&mdash;develop in the fimbria of the fallopian tubes before proliferating on the surface of the ovary. Dr. Trabert recently examined trends in fallopian tube cancers using the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) demonstrating that changes in diagnostic practice have already begun.</p>
<p>This change in the understanding of the origin of many ovarian cancers indicates that the etiology is likely quite heterogeneous. However, scientists suspect that inflammation may be a common mechanistic thread. Dr. Trabert&rsquo;s research focuses on clarifying the role of both systemic and local (tubal) inflammation in ovarian carcinogenesis by histologic subtype. She has published and continues to lead studies within the Ovarian Cancer Cohort Consortium to understand the role of anti-inflammatory medications, particularly low-dose aspirin, in reducing ovarian cancer risk. In addition, she recently spearheaded a study examining the role of sexually transmitted diseases that are associated with chronic pelvic inflammation, such as Chlamydia, and ovarian carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert also led molecular studies to better understand circulating markers of inflammation and ovarian cancer within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. She recently expanded this research by leading an analysis to evaluate associations between ovarian cancer risk and novel inflammatory markers: metabolites of arachidonic acid and linoleic acid.</p>
<h3>Hormonal Etiology of Female Cancers</h3>
<p>As evidenced by associations with menopausal hormone therapy and oral contraceptive use, hormonal factors play an important role in ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancers. However, the underlying carcinogenic mechanisms are not well understood. Surprisingly little is known about the role of endogenous hormones in ovarian and endometrial carcinogenesis, and although the role of circulating estrogens/estrogen metabolites in breast cancer etiology is established, few studies on circulating androgens and/or progesterone are available.</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert recently led a nested case-control study analysis within the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Observational Study (WHIOS) to evaluate the role of estrogen metabolism in ovarian and endometrial cancers. To further understand the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cohorts/bone-density-fit-study">role of endogenous hormones and cancer risk</a>, she has been a key player in the development of two novel hormone assays with colleagues at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. These assays measure androgens and androgen metabolites, and progesterone and progesterone metabolites. Androgens and progesterone are precursors of estrogen metabolites. Experimental data suggest that androgen and estrogen exposures to the endometrial and ovarian epithelium promote tumor growth while progesterone exposure mitigates risk. Combined with the existing capacity to measure estrogens and estrogen metabolites, the ability to measure multiple androgen and progesterone metabolites will help advance our understanding of the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/ovary/serum-sex-steroids-metabolites-ovarian-endometrial-cancer-whios">hormonal etiology of cancers</a> that occur in both men and women. Dr. Trabert is using these assays to analyze androgen/androgen metabolites and ovarian and endometrial cancer in WHIOS and a similar study of breast cancer within the Bone Density and Cancer Risk Follow-up Study of Women in the Fracture Intervention Trial (BFIT). In addition, she is leading novel investigations relating progesterone/progesterone metabolites to breast, ovarian, endometrial, and colorectal cancers in BFIT.</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert has contributed significantly to improving scientific understanding of the relationship between exogenous hormone use and cancer risk. Using the NIH-AARP Diet and Health study, she provided the strongest evidence to date that the use of estrogen plus progestin mitigates the increased risk of endometrial cancer observed with estrogen-only menopausal hormone therapy. More recently, Dr. Trabert and collaborators analyzed data from NIH-AARP to investigate whether the relationship between oral contraceptive use and risks for ovarian, endometrial, breast, and colorectal cancers change depending on health behaviors in the years leading up to and during menopause (for example, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and physical activity). In a separate study, they conducted a broad examination of oral contraceptive use and risk of many different cancers within NIH-AARP.</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert&rsquo;s research also focuses on <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cohorts/infertility-treated-women-follow-up-study">cancer risk related to fertility treatment</a>, which can involve high doses of ovulation-inducing medications and in vitro fertilization (IVF) procedures. To evaluate the potential impact on cancer risk in women undergoing fertility treatment, she is leading a country-wide retrospective medical record linkage study in Israel.</p>

<p>Dr. Hofmann's research is focused on evaluating the role of agricultural exposures in the etiology of multiple myeloma and other cancers, and on understanding the biological mechanisms that influence the development and progression of multiple myeloma. He is also investigating the etiology of renal cell carcinoma using both classical and molecular epidemiologic approaches.</p>
<h3>Investigating the Effects of Agricultural Exposures on Cancer Risk</h3>
<p>Agricultural exposures including pesticides, endotoxins, and diesel exhaust have been associated with risk of various cancers, although the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are generally not well understood. To better understand the biologic plausibility and potential mechanisms of action through which these exposures influence cancer risk. Dr. Hofmann serves as the principal investigator of the Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect in Agriculture (BEEA) study. In this molecular epidemiologic subcohort within the Agricultural Health Study, biospecimens (including blood, urine, buccal cells, and house dust) and updated information on pesticide use and other agricultural exposures were collected from over 1,600 pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Occupational Radiation Exposure and Cancer</h3>
<p>Everyone receives some degree of exposure to ionizing radiation&mdash;a known carcinogen&mdash;from both natural and man-made sources. Epidemiologists face many challenges when seeking to quantify the relationship between low levels of radiation and health risks in the general population. Occupational groups, such as radiologic technologists, are routinely monitored for radiation exposure as part of worker-safety measures, and thus provide a unique setting for studying associations between radiation and cancer. Dr. Kitahara is particularly interested in cancer risks associated with occupational exposure to low-dose radiation from emerging medical practices and procedures. Much of her current work focuses on nuclear medicine procedures (i.e., those involving radionuclides). Some of these procedures, including those that emit higher gamma radiation energy (e.g., positron emission tomography [PET]), are being performed with increasing frequency over time, potentially yielding greater cumulative exposure to the technologists who perform them. Findings from these studies can inform current radiation protection practices for medical radiation workers and, more broadly, improve our understanding of the impact of low-dose radiation exposure on the risk of cancer in the general population.</p>
<h3>Etiology of Radiosensitive Cancers</h3>
<p>A broader understanding of the etiology of radiation-associated cancers, including potential effect modifiers, is important for the study of radiation and cancer. Exposure to ionizing radiation during childhood is one of the few established risk factors for thyroid cancer and glioma; the thyroid and brain are two of the most radiosensitive organs. The relatively low incidence of these two malignancies makes them difficult to study. Of the few epidemiologic studies of non-ionizing radiation in relation to thyroid cancer and glioma, most are based on small numbers of incident cases or are case-control in design. Dr. Kitahara&rsquo;s research utilizes data from large prospective studies to address long-standing and new hypotheses regarding the influence of certain exposures (e.g., obesity, diet, smoking, and hormone use) across the life course on the risk of these two malignancies. Some examples of this work include a large pooled analysis of five prospective NCI studies on lifestyle-related factors and thyroid cancer risk. She has expanded this effort to include 22 prospective studies from the NCI Cohort Consortium. These studies, based in &nbsp;North America, Asia, and Europe, allow her to evaluate associations for anthropometric factors and other potential thyroid cancer risk factors by histological subtype. Using data from the GliomaScan consortium, Dr. Kitahara and colleagues evaluated the association for height and history of diabetes, as well as genetic polymorphisms, in relation to glioma risk. Dr. Kitahara has also worked with colleagues at the Institute of Preventive Medicine in Copenhagen, Denmark, to evaluate measured height and weight in childhood in relation to risk of thyroid cancer and glioma in adulthood./p&gt;</p>

<h3>Urologic Cancer Genetics</h3>
<p>My goal is to comprehensively identify clinically relevant variation associated with urologic cancers (bladder, kidney, and prostate) that improves our understanding and diagnosis of disease and&nbsp;that can be utilized as clinical biomarkers in clinical trials. Seminal research accomplishments to date include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lead author on the discovery of the <i>Birt-Hogg-Dub&eacute;</i> gene altered in families with inherited chromophobe kidney cancer, pneumothorax, and Birt-Hogg-Dub&eacute; Syndrome, characterized by benign fibrofolliculomas in hair follicles.</li>
<li>Developed a Sanger sequencing and analysis pipeline utilized to successfully identify a mutation in the <em>Dead-end</em> gene causal for testicular teratomas (germ cell tumors) in the Ter (teratoma) mouse; and mutations in the <i>MET</i> oncogene and fumarate hydratase in families with inherited papillary type I and II kidney cancer.</li>
<li>Senior author on the discovery of alterations in the UbiA prenyltransferase domain 1 (<i>UBIAD1</i>) gene in families with Schnyder Corneal Dystrophy.</li>
<li>Lead author on a study demonstrating improved detection of von Hippel-Lindau (<i>VHL</i>) gene alterations in 91% of sporadic clear cell kidney tumors that identified distinct tumor subsets with <i>VHL</i> sequence alterations or promoter hypermethylation.</li>
<li>Lead author on an exome sequencing study of prostate tumors that identified germline and somatic cancer gene alterations that were sequentially acquired during progression to metastatic disease.&nbsp;Led efforts to identify somatic and rare germline alterations in the methylcytosine dioxygenase <em>TET2</em> in families with prostate cancer and in sporadic patient tumors.</li>
<li>Lead author on an exome sequencing study of bladder tumors that identified somatic, nonsynonymous <em>BRCA1</em>-associated protein 1 (<em>BAP1</em>) alterations&nbsp;that contributed&nbsp;to a high prevalence of <em>BRCA</em> pathway defects in bladder cancer. These findings have since been confirmed by additional laboratories and the TCGA project and form the basis for a clinical trial that will be initiated in 2016.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Genetics of Bladder Cancer</h4>
<p>Lead or co-author on four publications describing next-generation sequencing (NGS) of bladder tumors in U.S. and Chinese patients. A 2014 study showed somatic, nonsynonymous alterations in the deubiquitinating enzyme, BAP1, were correlated with papillary tumor histology and contributed to a high frequency of <em>BRCA</em> pathway alterations and showed telomerase (<em>TERT</em>) was the most frequently altered gene by somatic and germline promoter mutations in 69% and 56% of tumors, respectively. Another study describes cancer gene alterations in 25 bladder cell lines and frequent, homozygous loss of the MTA phosphorylase, <em>MTAP</em>.</p>
<h4>Genetics of Prostate Cancer</h4>
<p>In an NGS study of prostate cancer (PCa), I characterized the accumulation of somatic alterations during progression of disease. An index patient inherited a deleterious <em>BRCA1</em> p.E23Rfs (rs80357713) and the remaining wild-type allele was lost in metastatic tumors. Copy number analysis of whole genome Helicos NGS identified a somatic deletion between <em>TMPRSS2</em> and <em>ERG</em>, which gave rise to a <em>TMPRSS2</em>-<em>ERG</em> fusion transcript.&nbsp;Additionally in metastatic tumors, an additional somatic frameshift truncated the remaining <em>TMPRSS2</em> allele. Somatic missense mutations were observed in epigenetic-associated <em>polybromo 1</em> (<em>PBRM1</em>) and the <em>ten-eleven translocation 2</em> (<em>TET2</em>) in the primary tumor and metastatic tumors, respectively. Additional somatic <em>TET2</em> sequence and copy number alterations were observed in metastatic tumors from additional patients, which were accompanied by complex combinations of nonsynonymous germline alterations. More recent work with collaborators has identified <em>TET2</em> binding partners with roles in androgen signaling and the enrichment of rare germline variants in families with inherited PCa.</p>
<h4>Genetics of Kidney Cancer</h4>
<p>Studies of kidney cancer genetics initiated by Dr. Nickerson have been conducted with collaborators from the NCI Urologic Oncology Branch and the NCI DCEG that examined somatic alterations associated with clear cell RCC. Current studies are in progress to examine somatic cancer gene alterations that may be associated with exposure, lifestyle, clinical factors, response to therapy and overall survival (manuscript in preparation). I am a member of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-kidney and pan-urology working groups.</p>
<h4>Clinical Trials</h4>
<ol>
<li>A Study to Evaluate the Efficacy of Bevacizumab in Combination With Tarceva for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer. Study Director: Paula O'Connor, M.D., Genentech. My team conducted molecular genetics analyses to characterize mutations in the <em>epidermal growth factor receptor</em> (<em>EGFR</em>) and <em>KRAS</em> in ~550 tumors, and their association with response to therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00130728.</li>
<li>A Study Comparing Bevacizumab Therapy With or Without Erlotinib for First-Line Treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (ATLAS). Study Director: Donald Strickland, M.D., Genentech. My team conducted molecular genetics analyses to characterize mutations in <em>EGFR</em> and <em>KRAS</em> in ~650 non-small cell lung cancer tumors and their association with response to therapy. ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00257608.</li>
<li>Examined cancer gene alterations in ~350 clear cell kidney tumors for an association with response to Avastin, in collaboration with the Cancer and Leukemia Group B, Phil Febbo, M.D. (Chief Scientific Officer, Genomic Health; and the University of California, San Francisco) and the NCI DCEG Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory.</li>
<li>Initiated a clinical trial examining the efficacy of a PARP inhibitor, Olaparib (Astra Zeneca), in patients with BRCA pathway-defective bladder tumors in collaboration with Drs. Andrea Apollo, NCI, and Tom Flaig and Dan Theodorescu, University of Colorado at Denver. Patient recruitment should begin in 2016.</li>

<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Stephanie Weinstein received a B.S. in biology from Tufts University and M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in nutrition from Cornell University. Her doctoral dissertation focused on one-carbon metabolism and cervical cancer. Upon completion of her graduate work, Dr. Weinstein was a postdoctoral fellow in the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB), Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, for three years. After working for one year as a nutritionist in the U.S. Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion, she returned to NCI as a staff scientist in NEB in 2002, and continues her duties in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch.</p>
<p>Since joining NCI, Dr. Weinstein received the NIH Fellows Award for Research Excellence and the NCI Staff Scientist/Staff Clinician Organization Travel Award.</p>
<h2><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Weinstein has published extensively on diet and cancer associations, with a focus on vitamin D, vitamin E, and one-carbon metabolism. In addition, she has served on the steering committee of several large collaborative/pooling projects, such as the Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers, the Circulating Biomarkers and Breast and Colorectal Cancer Consortium, and the Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Weinstein manages the <a href="http://atbcstudy.cancer.gov/">Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study</a>, a prospective cohort study that began as a clinical trial. Between 1985 and 1988, nearly 30,000 male smokers in southwestern Finland, ages 50-69, were randomized to receive daily supplementation of alpha-tocopherol (vitamin E), beta-carotene, both, or a placebo. Supplementation continued for 5&ndash;8 years, until 1993. Since that time, post-intervention follow-up of the cohort has continued, with yearly mortality and cancer incidence outcome updates. The ATBC study serves as an important resource of risk factor data and biospecimens used to study biochemical, nutritional, genetic, and molecular hypotheses relevant to cancer etiology, survival, early detection, and prevention.</p>

<p>Ms. Falk joined the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program in 1983 after receiving a M.S. degree in epidemiology and biostatistics from Georgetown University. Since that time, she has been involved in efforts to incorporate the study of molecular markers into large-scale epidemiologic studies, particularly in the area of hormonal carcinogenesis.&nbsp;Ms. Falk's&nbsp;early efforts to systematically evaluate the performance of laboratory assays influenced the direction of the program&rsquo;s research efforts in hormonal carcinogenesis. Her methods have since been used as a model to evaluate the feasibility of incorporating new molecular markers into epidemiologic studies.</p>
<p>With her longstanding interest in the role of steroid sex hormones in carcinogenesis, Ms. Falk has been involved in many studies throughout the Division evaluating circulating hormones and cancer risk. She has also played a key role in establishing a laboratory dedicated to developing reliable methods for measuring unique panels of estrogen, androgen and progesterone metabolites using state-of-the-art technology. Ms. Falk has guided all aspects of the design, implementation, and oversight of the laboratory component of many large epidemiologic studies of biomarkers such as estrogens, androgens, growth factors, vitamin D, cytokines, angiogenic factors and adipokines. She received an NIH Merit Award in 2009.</p>

<h3><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h3>
<p>Dr. Meredith Shiels earned her M.H.S. and Ph.D. in cancer epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She joined the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) as a Cancer Research Training Award postdoctoral fellow in 2009. She was awarded the Sallie Rosen Kaplan Fellowship for Women Scientists in Cancer Research that same year, and was promoted to research fellow in 2011.&nbsp;In 2016, Dr. Shiels became a tenure-track investigator in IIB.</p>
<h3><a id="Research Interests"></a>Research Interests</h3>
<p>Dr. Shiels uses innovative approaches to confront high-impact public health questions with population-based data resources and descriptive analyses. She combines multiple population-based data resources, quantifies the contribution of risk factors to time trends, and disaggregates cancer incidence and mortality rates to reveal underlying patterns and explanatory mechanisms. Currently, her research program focuses on 1) quantifying cancer risk and burden in people living with HIV; 2) estimating the impact of risk factors on changing cancer rates over time; and 3) understanding rising rates of premature mortality in the United States.</p>
<h3>Cancer Risk and Burden in the HIV-infected Population</h3>
<p>Cancer is a significant comorbidity among people living with HIV and understanding the shifting landscape of cancer risk and burden has public health implications for prevention and the allocation of both research and resources. Dr. Shiels&rsquo; work among HIV-infected people quantifies the evolving epidemiology of cancer; provides insight into cancer etiology; and examines the association between HIV and cancer progression. Dr. Shiels is the co-principal investigator of the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=12&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303678" sys_contentid="303678" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303678" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7282606">HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study</a>, a data linkage study of population-based HIV and cancer registries in the United States. Her recent work has projected future cancer rates and burden among U.S. adults with HIV, showing a decline in the number of cases of Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma and an increase in the number of lung and prostate cancers.</p>
<h3><strong>The Impact of Risk Factors on Trends in Cancer Rates</strong></h3>
<p>Dr. Shiels&rsquo; research program characterizes the extent to which candidate risk factors are driving observed temporal increases or decreases in cancer incidence rates. As cancer registries generally do not collect risk factor data, she uses linked databases and statistical modeling to disaggregate rates based on etiology, which is important for targeted prevention efforts. In recent studies, Dr. Shiels estimated the role of hepatitis C and hepatitis B viruses in rising rates of hepatocellular carcinoma, and the impact of the increasing prevalence of overweight and obesity on rising rates of papillary thyroid cancers.</p>
<h3>Investigating Premature Mortality Rates in the United States</h3>
<p>Dr. Shiels has additionally applied her expertise in interrogating large, population-based data to address specific public health questions related to the underlying drivers of premature mortality (deaths among 25-64-year-olds) rates in the United States, with a focus on the evolving drug overdose epidemic, which is a main contributor to rising premature mortality rates in some groups. Her recent studies have used U.S. national death certificate data to systematically assess and compare trends in premature, youth and infant mortality rates for each major cause of death by race/ethnicity and sex and to examine trends in premature overall and drug overdose death rates across measures of county-level socioeconomic status. She also has&nbsp;examined drug overdose death rates by race/ethnicity and specific contributing drug.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Jones earned her M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in epidemiology from the University at Albany (State University of New York) School of Public Health. She joined the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) as a postdoctoral fellow in 2012, became a research fellow in 2014, and was appointed to the tenure-track in 2017. Dr. Jones&rsquo; work has been recognized with several awards, including the DCEG Fellows Award for Research Excellence, the DCEG Intramural Research Award, the NCI Director&rsquo;s Innovation Award, and the Sallie Rosen Kaplan Fellowship for Women Scientists in Cancer Research.</p>
<h2><a id="ResearchInterests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Jones&rsquo; research focuses on the investigation of cancer risk associated with environmental contaminants, especially air and water pollutants. Her work relies on the application of Geographic Information Systems (GIS)&nbsp;and novel approaches to assess environmental exposures, and identifying and clarifying how they may cause cancer.</p>
<h3>Outdoor Air</h3>
<p>Outdoor air pollution is a known lung carcinogen, but the specific pollutants driving cancer risk and etiologic mechanisms are not well understood. Along with OEEB Branch Chief <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349599" sys_contentid="349599" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1965" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349599" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7252765">Debra Silverman, Sc.D.</a>, Dr. Jones is pursuing some of these questions in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=976905" sys_contentid="976905" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="976905" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7252763"> Los Angeles Ultrafines Study</a>, such as whether ultrafine particles (UFP), primarily emitted from vehicle exhaust, are a cause of lung cancer. Estimation of participants&rsquo; exposures to air pollution in this study requires innovation in both data collection and modeling, and makes use of a state-of-the-art approach for retrospectively quantifying exposure to UFP and other pollutants.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones is also leading efforts to evaluate potential cancer risks associated with air pollutants from industrial sources, to which much of the general population is routinely exposed. She is pursuing etiologic hypotheses related to emissions of dioxins and furans as well as those arising from intensive animal agriculture.<o:p></o:p></p>
<h3>Drinking Water</h3>
<p><span style="color: black; background: white;">Drinking water is an important route of exposure to numerous compounds of public health concern, including agricultural contaminants, disinfection-byproducts (DBP), and biologically active substances. Cancer risks associated with these exposures&nbsp;are not well understood, especially because measurement data to estimate exposure in epidemiologic study populations is limited. Dr. Jones&rsquo; drinking water research aims to address issues relating to exposure characterization and to describing cancer risks associated with contaminants of emerging concern. </span>She has developed exposure metrics for nitrate in public water supplies, which she and collaborators are using to investigate nitrate associations with several cancers. Promising results from the Iowa Women&rsquo;s Health Study&nbsp;cohort have motivated an effort to apply similar techniques in the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cohorts/agricultural-health-study">Agricultural Health Study</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones also has led multiple analyses of DBP in public drinking water, investigations that considered concomitant exposure to nitrate and other compounds. She is leading an effort evaluate the utility of bioassays in characterizing exposures to endocrine disrupting&nbsp;compounds in drinking water. She is also advancing research on environmentally persistent water contaminants, including per- and polyfluorinated compounds, and their relation to cancer.<o:p></o:p></p>
<h3>Exposure Assessment</h3>
<p>A fundamental underpinning of high quality environmental epidemiologic studies is accurate exposure assessment. The development of estimates that adequately reflect human exposure requires an understanding of exposure pathways, environmental transport and persistence, and individual exposure determinants, all of which have sources of uncertainty, especially in retrospective studies. Dr. Jones takes several approaches to improving long-term environmental exposure estimates, including optimizing the spatial accuracy of residential addresses and exposure sources, characterizing participant mobility and time spent in microenvironments, and incorporating information from surveys, regulatory monitoring data and other external datasets. Her work also focuses on characterizing exposure mixtures and validation studies to evaluate the quality of exposure estimates.</p>
<p>Dr. Jones is co-chair of the DCEG Geographic Analysis Working Group, which seeks to advance the use of <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1087390" sys_contentid="1087390" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1087390" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7252766">Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</a> and geospatial methods in epidemiologic studies of cancer.</p>

<h2><a id="biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Machiela received his M.P.H. in epidemiology from the University of Michigan and his Sc.D. in epidemiology from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health. His doctoral thesis focused on germline genetics and prostate cancer risk.&nbsp;Dr. Machiela&nbsp;joined the Laboratory of Translational Genomics as a postdoctoral fellow in 2012, and transitioned to the Laboratory of Genetic Susceptibility in 2015. In 2016, he was promoted to research fellow.&nbsp;Dr. Machiela&nbsp;was appointed to the position of Earl Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator in 2017.</p>
<h2><a id="research"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Machiela&rsquo;s research is focused on elucidating the role of germline variation and somatic mosaicism in cancer risk. He is leading studies of large-scale genetic mosaicism to investigate the causes of acquired mosaic alterations and their impact on cancer risk. He also conducts and analyzes genetic association studies to elucidate the underlying genetic architecture of different cancers (e.g. pediatric and common adult cancers).</p>
<h3>Genetic Mosaicism</h3>
<p>Genetic mosaicism results from an acquired DNA mutation that is present in some of the body's cells but not in others. A person with mosaicism has a mixture of normal and mutated cells. Dr. Machiela has published findings that estimate the frequency and distribution of mosaicism in existing genotyped collections of blood and buccal DNA. He is utilizing an unparalleled set of genotype data &ndash; 200,000 DCEG samples, 500,000 genotyped samples from the UK Biobank, and a merged international mosaicism consortium of over 1 million samples &ndash; to expand the size and scope of his research on mosaicism and cancer risk.</p>
<p>Relatively little is known of the mechanisms that initiate and select for mosaic alterations. Results from previous work suggests inherited germline variation (e.g. at <em>TCL1A</em>) or environmental exposures (e.g. smoking) may predispose to mosaicism. Dr. Machiela is utilizing genotyped samples from the UK Biobank and other datasets to examine endogenous and exogenous factors influencing acquisition of detectible mosaicism.</p>
<p>Acquired mosaic alterations have abundant potential to inform cancer etiology and drive oncogenic change. Dr. Machiela has found evidence to suggest that mosaicism increases cancer risk for hematologic malignancies and select solid tumor subtypes. He will continue to examine the influence of mosaicism on cancer risk in various populations and tissue types.</p>
<h3>Genetic Architecture of Cancer</h3>
<p>Dr. Machiela and colleagues have published several genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of common adult cancers. He is working to better understand the genomic architecture of cancer by performing genetic association studies in pediatric cancers, expanding association studies to incorporate whole-exome/genome sequencing data, and combining data on germline and somatic variation to better understand cancer genetic etiology and improve risk prediction.</p>
<p>Pediatric cancers like Ewing sarcoma (ES) provide a unique opportunity to study a homogenous tumor with potentially larger genetic contribution to risk. Dr. Machiela is leading a <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1121560" sys_contentid="1121560" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7367994" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1121560" sys_dependentvariantid="1418">GWAS on ES to identify susceptibility regions and elucidate the underlying genetic architecture of ES</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Machiela is the creator of a web-based tool, <a href="https://ldlink.nci.nih.gov/">LDlink</a>, which interactively explores linkage disequilibrium across 1000 Genomes population groups. LDlink is tailored for investigators interested in mapping disease susceptibility loci by generating output linking correlated alleles and highlighting putative functional variants. He is also the creator of <a href="https://authorarranger.nci.nih.gov/#/">AuthorArranger,</a> an online&nbsp;tool that&nbsp;helps researchers and consortia create and format title pages for journal submission.</p>

<p>Dr. Jonas Almeida leads a multidisciplinary research program that combines systems biology, computational statistics, and software engineering for biomedical applications. The primary focus of his research is to accelerate the investigation of epidemiologic and genetic causes of cancer by developing innovative methods to advance the computational research infrastructure for conducting precision prevention studies of cancer.</p>
<p>Dr. Almeida seeks to identify and deliver consumer-facing architectures for precision medicine and prevention that employ cloud computing, web applications, and machine learning. He explores this interrelated computational ecosystem by developing portable software solutions that can migrate between data sources &ndash; from consumer genomics to wearable sensing devices, and between different contexts of application from patients to caregivers.</p>
<p>As Chief Data Scientist for the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), Dr. Almeida has the dual responsibilities of 1) leading efforts for the integrated creation, management, and analysis of data-intensive knowledge bases, establishing cost-effective scalable researcher-facing analytic infrastructure, and defining new infrastructure to extract, manage, and analyze data in a scalable way to support epidemiological research within the Division; and 2) conducting independent research to advance real-time analytics of cancer &ldquo;Big Data&rdquo;. He provides support for the data and technology infrastructure used by the new prospective multi-center cohort study that will serve as an important Division-wide resource.</p>
<p>Dr. Almeida received his Ph.D. in Biological Engineering from the University Nova of Lisbon, Portugal in 1995. After a postdoctoral fellowship in computational statistics and machine learning at the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory, he became an Assistant Professor in Chemistry at the University of Lisbon in 1996, followed by an appointment as an Associate Professor of Biostatistics at the Medical University of South Carolina in 2001 and as a tenured Professor of Bioinformatics in the Division of Applied Mathematics of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2006. In 2008, MD Anderson awarded Dr. Almeida the endowed Abell-Hanger Distinguished Professorship in Bioinformatics. In 2011, he was recruited to be the inaugural Director of a new Division of Informatics and tenured Professor in the Department of Pathology of the University of Alabama at Birmingham. In 2015, he joined Stony Brook University as a tenured Professor and Chief Technology Officer. Dr. Almeida was appointed Chief Data Scientist of DCEG in 2019.</p>

<h3><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h3>
<p>Dr. Vogtmann, received her B.S. in biochemistry and molecular biology and B.A. in Spanish from Michigan State University in 2005. She went on to receive an M.P.H. in international health epidemiology from the University of Michigan in 2009, where she investigated human papillomavirus and cervical cancer awareness and mortality trends in Mexico. Dr. Vogtmann completed a Ph.D. in epidemiology in 2013 at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Her dissertation focused on cruciferous vegetable intake,&nbsp;<em>GST</em> polymorphisms, and colorectal cancer among men in Shanghai, China, completed in collaboration with the Shanghai Cancer Institute and Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Dr. Vogtmann joined DCEG as a Cancer Prevention Fellow in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch in August 2013 and was promoted to Research Fellow in June 2016. She was appointed to the position of Earl Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator in 2018. Dr. Vogtmann has received a number of awards for her work, including the NIH and DCEG Fellows&rsquo; Award for Research Excellence and the NCI Director&rsquo;s Innovation Award.</p>
<h3><a id="ResearchInterests"></a>Research Interests</h3>
<p>Dr. Vogtmann&rsquo;s research focuses on: 1) the association between the human microbiota and cancer risk; 2) how human microbiota may mediate associations between exposures and cancer risk; and 3) risk factors for head and neck and lower gastrointestinal cancers.</p>
<h3>Human microbiota and cancer risk</h3>
<p>Within the body, microbial cells&mdash;bacteria, viruses, fungi, etc.&mdash;outnumber human cells and are known to play both pathogenic and commensal roles. Nevertheless, the mechanistic contributions of the human microbiota to cancer and other diseases remain poorly characterized. Dr. Vogtmann applies cutting-edge microbial techniques in epidemiologic studies to investigate the role of the microbiota in cancer risk and progression. To perform this research, she currently utilizes oral wash specimens (originally collected as a source of DNA for study of the human genome) from multiple large cohort studies to determine the prospective association between the oral microbiota and cancer risk. She is also actively collaborating with investigators to include fecal collections in these large cohorts in order to be able to study the prospective association between the fecal microbiota with cancer risk. In addition to pursuing cancer risk analyses, she is evaluating methods to characterize the fungal component of the microbiota so its relationship to cancer risk can be considered.</p>
<h3>Associations between established cancer risk factors and the human microbiota</h3>
<p>In addition to direct effects, microbiota may also mediate relationships between various exposures and cancer risk. For example, tobacco products cause periodontal disease, a risk factor for oral cancer; alterations in the oral microbiota may mediate this association. Dr. Vogtmann investigates the effects of cancer risk factors, such as tobacco use, betel quid use, alcohol intake, and diet, on microbial communities.</p>
<h3>Risk factors for head and neck and lower gastrointestinal cancers</h3>
<p>In order to inform her studies of the microbiota as both a risk factor and a potential mediator for head and neck and lower gastrointestinal cancer, Dr. Vogtmann conducts studies to evaluate the impact of lifestyle factors on the risks of these cancers. She uses questionnaire data from prospective cohort studies, such as the Golestan Cohort Study and the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, to investigate cancer risk factors.</p>

<p>Dr. Caporaso received his undergraduate degree in chemistry and cell biology research and an M.S. in environmental science&nbsp;from Rutgers University, and his M.D. from the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey in 1980. After completing a residency in internal medicine in 1983, he joined the NCI as an oncology fellow in the Medicine Branch and a research fellow and biotechnology fellow in the Environmental Epidemiology Branch of NCI. In 1996, he became Chief of the Pharmacogenetics Section of the DCEG Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB). He served as Chief of GEB from 2011 to 2016.</p>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Caporaso serves on the DCEG Biorepository Planning Group, the Research Evaluation Panel and Biomarker Advisory Committees of the American College of Radiology Imaging Network (ACRIN), the Steering Committee for the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Cohort Study, the Technology Planning Group for the Next Generation Cohort for DCEG, the Steering Committee of the International Lung Cancer Consortium, and the&nbsp;NCI&nbsp;Data Access Committee charged with implementing sharing of available NCI genome-wide association study data with the scientific community. Dr. Caporaso is the Genetic Epidemiology Editor of <em>Cancer Biomarkers Epidemiology and Genetics</em> and teaches at the George Washington Milken School of Public Health and the University of Maryland, as well as the Molecular Epidemiology Course in DCEG, and the Translational Research in Clinical Oncology (TRACO) course for oncology fellows at NIH.</p>
<h2 id="research"><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Caporaso has focused his research on understanding the molecular and population determinants of lung cancer and smoking. To that end, he and his colleagues designed the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303605" sys_contentid="303605" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303605" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7252525" sys_variantid="1418">EAGLE (Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology) Study, a large, population-based case-control study of lung cancer in Italy,</a> to provide a resource for descriptive, molecular, clinical outcome, and genetic/genomic studies. He incorporated novel behavioral aspects such as nicotine dependency, which has made possible a series of studies involving Time To First Cigarette (TTFC), in which he showed that short TTFC constituted a risk factor for lung cancer and later for COPD. Also, Dr. Caporaso and his colleagues have conducted a series of studies exploring biomarkers (microbiome, cytokines, metabolomics) in relation to smoking and lung cancer and plan to consolidate this work in risk model studies.</p>
<p>Dr. Caporaso&rsquo;s second major research focus involves <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302601" sys_contentid="302601" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302601" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7252526" sys_variantid="1418">studying the etiology of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) in familial kindreds</a>, and related hematologic and lymphoproliferative conditions including Hodgkin lymphoma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia, among others. Dr. Caporaso, along with his colleagues and long-time collaborators, created an international consortium that identified monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) as a precursor condition to CLL. Within this group, he has been conducting follow-up studies of MBL as well as other investigations involving genetic analyses (GWAS and linkage), chromosome mosaic biomarker studies, single cell analyses, and planned studies of somatic mutations.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Caporaso has recently begun investigating the impact of circadian disruption on cancer&nbsp;with recent publications on social jetlag and cancer, a diurnal influence on metabolomic markers, sleep studies. A study of insulin levels in relations to health markers in National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is in preparation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Michael B. Cook earned his B.Sc. in genetics at the University of Nottingham, England, and, subsequently, a Ph.D. in epidemiology at the University of Leeds, England. He joined the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics as a postdoctoral fellow in 2007, was promoted to research fellow in 2008, and was appointed as a tenure-track investigator in 2011. Dr. Cook&rsquo;s research program is focused on the epidemiology of esophageal adenocarcinoma and prostate cancer. He investigates the role of excess adiposity, sex steroid hormones and reproductive factors on cancer pathogenesis, and biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. The overarching goal of Dr. Cook&rsquo;s research is to understand pathogenesis with potential utility for clinical management.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<h4><strong>Esophageal Adenocarcinoma</strong></h4>
<p>Esophageal adenocarcinoma incidence has dramatically increased in the United States accompanied with a 5-year survival of less than 20%. Despite its widely-accepted pathogenesis of gastroesophageal reflux &rarr; Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus &rarr; esophageal adenocarcinoma, many etiologic questions remain and predictive biomarkers are needed to optimize prevention and diagnosis. Dr. Cook utilizes both classical and molecular epidemiologic approaches in his studies of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Specifically, he seeks to elucidate: 1) the pathogenesis and progression of this disease; 2) how excess adiposity is associated with an increased risk of this malignancy; 3) why Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus and esophageal adenocarcinoma are more prevalent in men compared with women; and 4) biomarkers for diagnosis and risk prediction. Dr. Cook is pursuing studies of sex steroid hormones, systemic inflammation, microRNAs, and other circulating and tissue-based markers in his pursuit of answers to these questions.</p>
<h4>Prostate Cancer</h4>
<p>Prostate cancer is predominantly an indolent cancer with a variable and unpredictable prognosis. Therefore, the main goals of Dr. Cook&rsquo;s prostate cancer research program are to study clinically-relevant disease&mdash;defined as aggressive, progressive, and fatal forms&mdash;to elucidate etiology and discover prognostic biomarkers. The specific aims of Dr. Cook&rsquo;s prostate cancer research program are to: 1) describe and understand the basis of racial differences; 2) elucidate the role of excess adiposity; 3) understand the etiologic roles of sex steroid hormones and reproductive factors; and 4) discover and validate tissue biomarkers to aid prediction of progression. Dr. Cook is conducting studies using age-period-cohort models, and latent class trajectory models to aid our understanding of racial differences, incidence rates and excess adiposity in relation to clinically-relevant disease. In addition, Dr. Cook is using large datasets to study endogenous and exogenous hormones as well as reproductive factors to assess these exposures in relation to prostate cancer risk. Finally, he is assessing whether computational pathology of prostate biopsy or radical prostatectomy samples may improve diagnostic and prognostic algorithms of prostate cancer.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Little studied mathematics at Trinity College, Cambridge and obtained his doctorate in mathematics at New College, Oxford. Over the last two decades he has analyzed dose response for cancer and cardiovascular disease risks in populations exposed to ionizing radiation and cigarette smoke. Dr. Little has developed statistical models to elucidate mechanisms of carcinogenesis and cardiovascular disease in various irradiated populations, and to highlight the effects of measurement error on regression estimates. He currently serves on a National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP) committee, and has previously been a member of the United Kingdom (UK) Health Protection Agency&rsquo;s Advisory Group on Ionising Radiation. He has also served as consultant to the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR), the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), and to the UK Committee on Medical Aspects of Radiation in the Environment (COMARE).</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<h3>Low-dose radiation and cancer risk</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Little has quantified radiation-cancer dose-response relationship at low and very low doses and examined the likelihood of dose thresholds. He has evaluated the relationship of radiation levels with breast, thyroid, and other solid cancers and hematopoietic malignancies in populations exposed to environmental, occupational and medical sources of radiation. Dr. Little has also developed and fit statistical models to account for the effects of dose measurement error on the shape of the dose-response curve. In light of the continued controversy about in utero radiation effects, Dr. Little is particularly interested in associations of low-level radiation in utero, postnatally, or preconception with risk of pediatric leukemia. He has spearheaded novel work on postnatal radiation exposures that suggests close to 15-20% of childhood leukemia could be caused by natural background exposures. Since joining NCI, Dr. Little is the lead statistician in the UK-NCI study of cancer risk following pediatric CT exposure, and assessment of thyroid cancer risk in persons exposed in childhood to radiation fallout following the Chernobyl accident &ndash; in each case taking account of errors in dose.</p>
<h3>High-dose radiation and cancer risk</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Little has also investigated radiation effects at the much higher doses characteristic of radiotherapy, and potential modification by chemotherapy and genetic factors. Dr Little&rsquo;s work suggests that in general cancer relative risks in patients treated with radiotherapy are lower than in comparable (age-, sex-, time-since-exposure-matched) subsets of the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. He has developed mechanistic models that explain these lower risks.</p>
<h3>Low and moderate dose radiation and cardiovascular risk</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Although excess radiation-associated circulatory disease risk is associated with high-dose radiotherapy, evidence of circulatory disease at low doses of radiation is inconsistent. Dr. Little has analyzed cardiovascular risk in a number of moderate- and low-dose radiation exposed groups, in particular the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, in a group exposed for treatment of peptic ulcer, and in a cohort given diagnostic X-rays as part of the treatment for tuberculosis. He has also conducted a number of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of low-dose radiation and cardiovascular disease risk, which add to the weight of evidence for moderate- and low-dose associations and recently proposed a promising candidate mechanism, which may explain these associations.</p>
<h3>Modeling of radio-biological processes</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Little has developed novel quasi-biological (mechanistic) models of carcinogenesis and related radiobiological endpoints to account for time variation in latency and other patterns of radiation-induced cancer risk. A model developed by Dr. Little to assess the potential role of transmissible genomic instability, when applied to NCI Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results population-based colon cancer incidence data, revealed little evidence that genomic instability was responsible for initiation of colon cancer. These models, when fitted to both human and animal data, have shown promise in explaining the interaction of ionizing radiation and cigarette smoke as causes of lung cancer. Dr. Little has also recently extended his work on statistical fitting of these models of carcinogenesis to describe methods for assessing the number of estimable parameters.</p>

<h2 id="Biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Shahinaz Gadalla earned her medical degree from Ain Shams University School of Medicine in Cairo, Egypt, and an M.S. and a Ph.D. in epidemiology from the University of Maryland, Baltimore. She joined the Clinical Genetics Branch within the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics as a Cancer Prevention Fellow in 2008, and was promoted to a Staff Scientist in 2011. In 2014, she was appointed as an Earl Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator. Dr. Gadalla&rsquo;s research interests focus on the role of genetic factors in cancer etiology, as well as identifying genetic and environmental risk factors among individuals at high risk of developing cancer. She has received numerous awards for her work, including a Fellows&rsquo; Intramural Research Award and an NCI Director&rsquo;s Intramural Innovation Award.</p>
<h2 id="Research">Research Interests</h2>
<h3>Cancer Predisposition in Patients with Myotonic Dystrophy</h3>
<p>Myotonic Dystrophy (DM) is an inherited disorder that represents the most common type of adult onset muscular dystrophy group of diseases. In 2011, Dr. Gadalla and colleagues were the first to report epidemiological evidence of excess cancer risk in DM patients. Dr. Gadalla analyzed data from population registries in Sweden and Denmark and observed a high risk of endometrial, ovarian, brain and colon cancer among DM patients. This work identified DM as a new cancer susceptibility syndrome. Dr. Gadalla plans to build on this work, and her future research in this area aims at understanding the cancer risk factors and the molecular mechanisms behind this observation.</p>
<h3>Telomere Biology and Human Diseases &nbsp;</h3>
<p>Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that are essential for maintaining chromosomal integrity. Germline mutations in telomere biology genes cause diverse phenotypes including classic dyskeratosis congenita, aplastic anemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and others. Dr. Gadalla is interested in elucidating factors that contribute to this phenotypic variation. In addition, she is leading studies to understand how telomere length may contribute to transplant outcomes in patients who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for aplastic anemia. Her future work in this area will focus on the role of telomere dysfunction in cancer risk following transplantation.</p>

</div>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Schiffman received an M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania and an M.P.H. in epidemiology from The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health. He joined the NCI as a Staff Fellow in 1983 and, in 1996, was appointed Chief of the Interdisciplinary Studies Section in the Environmental Epidemiology Branch (which later became the HPV Research Group in the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch). He joined the Clinical Genetics Branch in October 2009 to study intensively why HPV is such a powerful carcinogenic exposure, akin to an acquired genetic trait with high penetrance for a cancer phenotype.</p>
<p>Dr. Schiffman received a Fulbright Scholarship in 1977 to carry out epidemiologic studies in Senegal. He has received numerous awards for his work in molecular epidemiology, including the ACS Medal of Honor and the AACR Prevent Cancer Foundation Award.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>The main studies in which Dr. Schiffman played a major role in the past 5 years, listed chronologically, include: The Portland Kaiser Cohort; the Taiwan Cohort Study; the Guanacaste Natural History Study; the ASCUS-LSIL Triage Study (ALTS); the Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants (SUCCEED/Biopsy); the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT); the Persistence and Progression (PaP) Study; and Nigeria Project Itoju. These studies overall have related HPV status to outcome for more than 100,000 women. Two were extremely large randomized trials. The two oldest cohorts have accrued more than 15 years of follow-up time. Through a natural progression of studies, he has pursued three main scientific themes: 1) HPV Natural History and Cervical Carcinogenesis; 2) Translational Studies of HPV Testing, Cytology, Colposcopy, and Vaccines; and 3) Risk Prediction and Cervical Cancer Prevention.</p>
<p>With regard to natural history, he has worked extensively with his major laboratory collaborator, Dr. Robert Burk (Albert Einstein, through a collaborative research agreement) on HPV phylogeny, investigating HPV at the levels of individual infections, women&rsquo;s experience with HPV during their lifetimes, and populations. His work has helped promulgate a multi-stage causal model of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis based on a few distinct steps: acute infection with carcinogenic HPV type(s), detectable viral persistence (rather than clearance) linked to development of cervical precancer (CIN3), and invasion.</p>
<p>The natural history studies gave rise to translational research on HPV tests, serology, cytology, colposcopy, histology, and vaccines. He has helped to show that HPV testing is useful along the entire course of cervical cancer prevention, and must be integrated now with HPV vaccination. As co-Project Officer and Medical Monitor of the independent NCI Vaccine Trial, he has been heavily involved with virtually all aspects of that project.</p>
<p>The availability of improved cervical cancer risk tests and vaccines led to an active interest in risk prediction and cervical cancer prevention. These efforts rest on a universal base of quantifiable science (risk prediction) but reach into the realm of policy, which is deeply affected by setting. Thus, prevention work in the wealthy mainstream of the U.S. is much different than international work in low-resource settings; Dr. Schiffman has worked especially in Nigeria and Senegal. The high sensitivity of HPV DNA testing makes the test amenable to one or two screens in a lifetime.</p>
<p>In terms of HPV genomics, Dr. Schiffman and his laboratory and epidemiologist collaborators are using whole genome sequencing and genotype-phenotype analyses to understand the uniquely high carcinogenicity of HPV16 compared with closely related HPV types. Also, as a major new area, he is exploring the association between methylation of CpG sites in the HPV genome (particularly in L2 and L1) and diagnosis of CIN3, as compared with viral clearance. As part of the vaccine trial analysis, he and his collaborators will investigate whether HPV genetic variants explain partial cross-protection by comparing selected ?9- and ?7-containing samples from the Cervarix and Havrix (control) vaccine arms for variant status. Regarding clinical management, he and colleagues are conducting analyses of the impact of vaccination on frequency of cytologic abnormalities, colposcopic referrals, and biopsies.</p>

<p class="first-graf">Dr. Christian Abnet earned a Ph.D. in environmental toxicology from the University of Wisconsin in 1998 and an M.P.H. in epidemiology from the University of Minnesota in 1999. He joined NCI as a Cancer Prevention Fellow in the Division of Cancer Prevention in 1998. Dr. Abnet became a tenure-track investigator in the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) in 2005. In 2014, he was awarded scientific tenure by NIH and appointed Acting Chief of NEB. In 2015, he was named Chief of the newly established <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=23&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=1033171" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7275931" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033171" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="1033171">Metabolic Epidemiology Branch</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Abnet's work focuses on the etiology of esophageal and gastric cancer. His research interests are driven by a desire to meet the needs of populations in limited-resource settings who are at highest risk for these diseases.</p>
<h3>Etiologic Studies of Esophageal and Gastric Cancer</h3>
<p>Esophageal cancer presents one of the most uneven worldwide geographic distributions of all cancers with several regions of extraordinarily high incidence. There are two primary bands of high-incidence populations with one stretching across central Asia from China to Iran and a second spanning East to Southern Africa. Overall, gastric cancer patterns appear distinct from esophageal cancer, but populations with high rates of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tend to have co-occurring high rates of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma. Tobacco smoking and excessive alcohol drinking account for most ESCC in the US and similar countries, but these factors play little or no role in high-incidence populations.</p>
<p>Dr. Abnet studies the complex pattern of incidence and differing etiologic factors for these two malignancies and the multiple risk factors across diverse populations that share high rates of ESCC and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma. Specifically, he examines the nutritional underpinnings of ESCC and upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer, with a focus on the role of vitamins D, C, and B; and tobacco, alcohol, and other harmful habits.</p>
<p>Dr. Abnet is a member of the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=8&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1090903" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1090903" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7275933" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1090903">African Esophageal Cancer Consortium (AfrECC)</a>.</p>
<h3>Genetics and Genomics</h3>
<p>The advent of genome-wide association studies has allowed Dr. Abnet to pursue powerful genetic studies of these cancers in high- and low-incidence populations.&nbsp;In a first study of ESCC and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma in ethnic Chinese subjects, Dr. Abnet and colleagues found that a single locus encompassing the phospholipase C, epsilon 1 (<i>PLCE1</i>) gene was the top hit for both cancers. In the future, this team will complete additional work on susceptibility to gastric cancer in Chinese populations and complementary studies of ESCC and gastric cancer in Caucasians. This comprehensive examination across continents will provide the fullest possible understanding of the genetic contribution to the apparent etiologic differences.</p>
<h3>Oral Health and Oral Microbiome</h3>
<p>Dr. Abnet also carries out research into the bacterial milieu of the upper digestive tract. He has shown associations between oral health and UGI cancer risk in China, Finland, Iran, and India, and is now exploring potential underlying mechanisms between oral health and risk of UGI cancers overall.&nbsp;Dr. Abnet has completed one of the first large, prospective epidemiologic studies of the upper digestive tract microbiome and found associations with pre-neoplastic conditions in both the esophagus and stomach.&nbsp;He is employing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study to assess the impact of tobacco on the oral microbiome.&nbsp;This study is the first to characterize the effects of tobacco on the oral microbiome in a nationally representative study population and allows for the examination of the association between the oral microbiome and tobacco related diseases. It is funded by the Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products through a trans-NIH&mdash;FDA collaboration coordinated by the <a href="https://prevention.nih.gov/tobacco-regulatory-science-program">NIH Tobacco Regulatory Science Program</a>.</p>

</ul>
<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Lan received her M.D. at Weifang Medical University and her Ph.D. in molecular epidemiology at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine in Beijing, as part of a joint training program with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and her M.P.H. at Johns Hopkins University. She was awarded NIH scientific tenure in 2008. Dr. Lan uses classic epidemiologic methods, detailed exposure assessment approaches, and state-of-the-art biomarker platforms to evaluate relationships between important exposures and cancer, and to obtain mechanistic insight.</p>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Lan has received multiple awards, including the NIH Merit Award for her pioneering research on lung cancer and indoor air pollution that led to interventions that reduced cancer risk; the U.S. EPA Scientific and Technological Achievement Award, and the DCEG intramural research award.</p>
<h2 id="research"><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Lan&rsquo;s research focuses on the molecular epidemiology of indoor air pollution and lung cancer and occupational exposures to known or suspected carcinogens, as well as the etiology of hematopoietic malignancies. She has conducted molecular epidemiologic studies of populations exposed to well-defined classes of chemical compounds that are known or suspected carcinogens, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), benzene, formaldehyde, trichloroethylene, diesel, carbon black, nanoparticles, and others. Dr. Lan and her colleagues apply "omic" technologies in their studies including metabolomics, genomics, epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and whole genome sequencing, as well as conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS).</p>
<h3>Molecular Epidemiology Studies of Lung Cancer Among Never Smokers</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Lung cancer rates for never-smoking women in Asia are among the highest in the world. The histological distribution and molecular characteristics of lung cancer in this population have patterns that are distinctly different from lung cancer among smokers. Although the etiology remains mostly unexplained, it may be due in part to the contribution of environmental exposures such as the use of coal for cooking, secondhand smoke, and exposure to exhaust from cooking. Dr. Lan has conducted a series of studies to investigate the relationship between environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility, and risk of lung cancer in Xuanwei, China, where lung cancer rates are among the highest in the world for never-smoking women.&nbsp;Dr. Lan formed and leads the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia to study both environmental and genetic risk factors for lung cancer and has led the largest GWAS of lung cancer among never-smokers.</p>
<h3 class="first-graf">Molecular Epidemiology Studies of Known or Suspected Carcinogenic Combustion-Derived Particulates</h3>
<p>There is increasing evidence that particulate matter exposure from multiple sources of indoor and outdoor pollution causes lung cancer; however, the carcinogenic components of particulates have not been clearly identified (e.g., organic vs. elemental carbon core). Dr. Lan conducted a series of cross-sectional molecular epidemiology studies of populations exposed to particulates that are known or suspected carcinogens including diesel exhaust, carbon black, and multi-walled carbon nanotubules.</p>
<h3>Molecular Epidemiology Studies of Benzene, Trichloroethylene, and Formaldehyde</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Benzene is known to have toxic effects on the blood and bone marrow and is a known leukemogen and suspect lymphomagen, but its impact at levels below the U.S. occupational standard of 1 part per million (ppm) remains uncertain. Dr. Lan and her colleagues carried out a cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study with detailed exposure assessment to investigate the effect of benzene exposure below 1 ppm and found that white blood cell and platelet counts were significantly lower among workers exposed to benzene compared to unexposed workers. She and her colleagues are evaluating additional hematologic changes, cytogenetic abnormalities, altered proteomic and mRNA expression, and genetic susceptibility in workers exposed to benzene.</p>
<p>Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant and is present in many EPA Superfund sites. TCE is a recognized kidney carcinogen, but its carcinogenicity is still unclear for other cancer sites (e.g., non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), liver). To address questions about TCE&rsquo;s mechanism of action, Dr. Lan has conducted a molecular epidemiology study of biomarkers related to immune function and kidney toxicity as well as alterations in methylation, the metabolome, and microRNA to evaluate the biologic plausibility of carcinogenicity related to occupational exposure to TCE.</p>
<p>Epidemiological studies have shown that occupational exposure to formaldehyde is associated with increased risk of leukemia, particularly myelogenous leukemia. Dr. Lan carried out a molecular epidemiological study analyzing chromosomal aberrations and alterations of immune markers to explore the biologic plausibility of this association.</p>
<h3>Molecular Epidemiology Study of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</h3>
<p>The incidence rates of NHL in the United States steadily increased over the last half of the 20th century. Despite many studies into this malignancy, there are still questions about the etiology of NHL and its subtypes.</p>
<p>Dr. Lan generated a series of novel findings from her studies of occupational, environmental, and genetic factors and risk of NHL among non-Hispanic whites. However, the ability to follow-up, confirm, and extend those observations is limited by several factors: relatively low exposure to several suspected chemical carcinogens, and low allele frequency, and/or high to complete linkage disequilibrium for multiple candidate genetic loci in Western populations. To address these issues Dr. Lan and her colleagues conducted a case-control study of lymphoma and leukemia in East Asia (i.e., AsiaLymph). The study takes advantage of the higher prevalence and greater range of certain key risk factors in Asia compared to the West, as well as differences in genetic background. It will provide new insights into the etiologies of lymphoma and leukemia.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Ziegler is a special volunteer in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program of the National Cancer Institute. Her research on diet, nutrition, and cancer has emphasized both etiology and public health implications, and has integrated biochemical and molecular techniques. Dr. Ziegler received a B.A. in chemistry and English from Swarthmore College, a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California at Berkeley, and a M.P.H. in epidemiology and public policy from the Harvard School of Public Health. She has developed and taught courses on public health nutrition, international nutrition, and global food resources at Yale, Harvard, and Tufts Universities. Dr. Ziegler helped establish the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Interest Section of the American Society of Nutritional Sciences and currently serves on the editorial boards of the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, and the Nutrition Action Healthletter. In 1996, she was awarded the NIH Merit Award for her research on the role of vegetables, fruits, and micronutrients in the etiology of cancer. Dr. Ziegler retired from federal service in October 2018.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<h3>Multidisciplinary Studies of Diet, Nutrition, and Cancer</h3>
<h4>Vegetables, Fruits, and Carotenoids</h4>
<p class="first-graf">Previously, we demonstrated that diets high in vegetables, fruits, and carotenoids were strongly associated with reduced risk of lung and upper aerodigestive tract cancers. To explore the individual contributions of the major carotenoids, we conducted nested case control studies in the Honolulu Heart Program cohort. High serum levels of several carotenoids were associated with decreased risk of lung, oral pharyngeal, esophageal, and laryngeal cancer, with a-carotene the most predictive. Recently, in the Nurses and Health Professionals cohorts, using repeated dietary measures, we found that high vegetable and fruit intake was associated with only a modestly reduced risk of lung cancer in women and no risk reduction in men. Our analyses suggested that the strength of this widely accepted relationship might have been exaggerated because confounding by smoking has not always been adequately controlled. Since other recent publications have questioned whether vegetable intake can reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, we are exploring opportunities to continue to evaluate the importance of vegetables and fruits in cancer etiology, with emphasis on prospective studies, range and variety in intake, and accurate assessment of exposure. Initially, we will explore vegetable and fruit intake, circulating levels of individual carotenoids, and risk of colorectal polyps at various stages in the speculated progression to cancer, using data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) cohort.</p>
<p>Lycopene, a carotenoid concentrated in tomato products, has been linked to reduced risk of prostate cancer in several studies. In a case control study conducted among U.S. blacks and whites, we found that high circulating lycopene was protective in both races. In addition, circulating levels were lower in the blacks, which suggested that low lycopene might contribute to the substantially higher rates of prostate cancer among U.S. blacks. The protective influence of lycopene rich diets has been most consistently seen in U.S. studies, so we are now exploring the influence of high circulating lycopene in a cohort of Finnish men with distinct dietary patterns.</p>
<h4>One-Carbon Metabolism</h4>
<p class="first-graf">Disruption of one carbon metabolism can interfere with DNA synthesis, repair, and methylation and thus promote carcinogenesis. Efficient one carbon metabolism requires not only folate but also vitamins B2, B6, and B12 and optimal activity of multiple enzymes, such as methylene tetrahydrofolate reductase and methionine synthase. In a community based case control study of invasive cervical cancer in five areas in the U.S., we found that low serum and red blood cell folate were only modestly predictive of increased risk. However, elevated serum homocysteine was strongly and significantly predictive (RR's~2 3), which suggested that pervasive problems in one carbon metabolism might be involved. We are now assessing the contribution of B vitamin inadequacies and common polymorphisms in key one carbon metabolism genes. In addition, we will be evaluating the importance of one carbon metabolism in the etiology of brain and colorectal cancer. Dietary and vitamin supplement information are being analyzed in a multicenter case control study of brain cancer, and will be complemented by assays for genetic polymorphisms. In the PLCO cohort, 2,400 men and women were diagnosed with colorectal adenomatous polyps at baseline. The dietary information, serum, and DNA collected in this study will allow us to relate the role of one carbon metabolism to the speculated progression of colorectal cancer. Since folic acid fortification has already been shown to decrease homocysteine levels in populations with a variety of nutritional and genetic impairments, our results may indicate how targeted supplementation and/or fortification schemes may contribute to cancer prevention.</p>
<h4>Breast Cancer</h4>
<p class="first-graf">International variation in breast cancer incidence and migrant studies indicate that modifiable factors play a major role in breast cancer etiology, although the specific lifestyles and environmental exposures remain elusive. We designed a large, population-based case-control study of breast cancer in Asian-American women to take advantage of their diversity in diet and breast cancer risk. Childhood, adolescent, and adult exposures were assessed by interviewing both study participants and their mothers. To complement the extensive interview information, body size and shape were measured, and blood and urine samples were collected. Endogenous hormones, phytoestrogens, growth factors, micronutrients, and fatty acids have been or will be measured in selected specimens. We found a 6-fold gradient in breast cancer risk by migration history within our study population, comparable to the international differences in breast cancer incidence rates. Exposures during adult life substantially influenced risk. Furthermore, there was no evidence of an especially susceptible period during menarche or early reproductive life. Increased adiposity and weight gain in the decade preceding diagnosis were critical determinants of risk. Thus, excess weight may function as a late stage promoter in breast carcinogenesis, and weight maintenance or reduction as an adult may have a significant and rapid impact on breast cancer risk. We are currently exploring which endogenous hormones, hormone metabolites, growth factors, and dietary patterns are most correlated with migration history, and thus likely determinants of the 6-fold gradient in breast cancer incidence. Circulating estrogens were only weakly associated with Westernization, while circulating androgens were inversely associated in both pre- and postmenopausal women. Decreased intake of soy was associated with a doubling of breast cancer risk. We now want to examine the broader dietary patterns associated with soy intake; in particular, its relationship to vegetable, fruit, and grain consumption; the relative contributions of childhood and adult soy intake; and what specific isoflavones and lignans seem important. Since height was a strong and consistent predictor of risk in these Asian-American women, we are seeking biologic explanations, with emphasis initially on insulin-like growth factors.</p>

<p>Telomeres, specialized structures consisting of long DNA nucleotide repeats and a protein complex, are designed to protect the ends of chromosomes and are critical to chromosome stability. Each time a cell divides, the telomeres lose a small amount of DNA and become shorter. Eventually, telomeres become critically short, causing cellular senescence or cellular crisis, which result in apoptosis, genomic instability or a reduction in cellular lifespan. If cells bypass natural processes and continue to divide despite the presence of genomic instability, cancer can develop. Dr. Savage investigates the connection between telomere biology and cancer through studies of the association between telomere length and cancer risk, the telomere biology disorder dyskeratosis congenita, and the&nbsp;<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=8&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=511115" sys_contentid="511115" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="511115" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7276748">genetic contribution to telomere biology</a>.</p>
<h3>Understanding Cancer Etiology - Osteosarcoma</h3>
<p>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant bone tumor and typically occurs during the adolescent growth spurt.

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Chatterjee received his Bachelor&rsquo;s and Master&rsquo;s degree from the Indian Statistical Institute, Calcutta and a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Washington, Seattle in 1999. He served as Chief of the Biostatistics Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), National Cancer Institute (NCI) for almost eight years. Dr. Chatterjee now serves as a Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at the Johns Hopkins University with joint appointments at the Bloomberg School of Public Health (Biostatistics) and the School of Medicine (Oncology). He remains a Special Volunteer with DCEG.</p>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Chatterjee's research focuses on a diverse set of quantitative issues that arise in design, analysis, interpretation and public health translation of modern molecular and genetic epidemiologic studies. He has made methodological contributions in cutting-edge topics such as analysis of genetic associations and gene-environment interactions, modeling etiologic heterogeneity by disease subtypes and development of models for risk prediction. He has played key roles in design and analysis of genome-wide association studies of various cancers with a particular emphasis on smoking related sites, such as lung and bladder. He is an active mentor for a number of Fellows and junior investigators and provides guidance for many ongoing projects in various areas such as risk-modeling, gene-environment interaction, design and analysis of studies that use next-generation sequencing. He is an elected Fellow of the American Statistical Association (2008), an elected member of the American Epidemiologic Society (2012) and is the recipient of numerous national and international awards, including the Mortimer Spiegelman Award (2010) for outstanding contribution to public health statistics, the Snedecor Award (2011) for significant contribution to theory of Biometry and the notable COPSS President&rsquo;s award (2011) jointly sponsored by five major statistical societies to recognize the outstanding contribution by a young statistician.</p>

<p class="first-graf">Dr. Stewart received his M.D. from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in 1998. He completed a residency in internal medicine at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in 2001 and training in medical genetics at the Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia in 2004. He is board-certified in both internal medicine and clinical genetics. He had postdoctoral training in genetics in the laboratory of Richard Spielman at Penn from 2002-2004. In 2004 he joined the National Human Genome Research Institute as part of the Physician Scientist Development Program to investigate the monogenic tumor predisposition syndrome neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). In recognition for his work in NF1, he was named one of NIH&rsquo;s first Earl Stadtman Investigators when he joined the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Clinical Genetics Branch in the summer of 2010. He was awarded NIH scientific tenure and promoted to senior investigator in 2019. His major research interests are the adult manifestations of RAS-pathway disorders (especially NF1 and Legius syndrome), next generation sequencing of NF1-associated tumors and the characterization of novel features of NF1. Dr Stewart was responsible for the early detailed characterization of the chromosome 9q sub-telomeric deletion syndrome (now Kleefstra syndrome) and the recognition (with Eric Legius, Leuven Belgium) of glomus tumors as part of the NF1 tumor spectrum. Dr. Stewart is also study director/principal investigator for the <a href="http://ppb.cancer.gov/">Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB) <i>DICER1</i> Cancer Study</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="research">Research</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Stewart is continuing data analysis from two protocols from his time at NHGRI: "Variation in Gene Expression in Neurofibromatosis Type 1" (05-HG-0152) which seeks to identify genetic modifiers of NF1 and "Natural history and biology of dermal neurofibromas in neurofibromatosis type 1" (06-HG-0134), which uses novel methods to characterize neurofibroma growth in NF1. He is developing new protocols investigating whole-genome sequencing of benign and malignant tumors in NF1 and the genetics of radiation sensitivity.</p>
</div>
<p>Dr. Stewart is recruiting participants for the <a href="http://ppb.cancer.gov/">PPB Cancer Study</a>, an observational study of children with PPB and their families. The study will help researchers define the tumor types and risks associated with the <em>DICER1</em> syndrome. Dr. Stewart hopes to identify other genes that may play a role in this syndrome. He also would like to understand why some mutation carriers develop cancer while others remain healthy.</p>

</div>
<p>Dr. Lee received a Ph.D. degree in health physics in 2002 from Hanyang University in South Korea. He subsequently joined the Innovative Technology Center for Radiation Safety in South Korea as a postdoctoral fellow, and later completed extensive training in computational medical physics as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Florida. Dr. Lee joined the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) as a tenure-track investigator in 2009, and was awarded scientific tenure and promoted to senior investigator in September 2016 and named Head of REB&rsquo;s Dosimetry Unit. Dr. Lee is a full member on two task groups of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP). He also serves on the editorial board of <em>Radiation Protection Dosimetry</em>.</p>
<h2><a id="Research"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Lee develops methods and tools to estimate radiation dose from medical exposures, including treatment and diagnostic tests, in order to generate reliable data for use in epidemiological studies of ionizing radiation and cancer risk.</p>
<h3>Computational Human Phantoms</h3>
<p>There are two broad approaches to determine organ doses to portions of the human body exposed to ionizing radiation: measurement and calculation. Although measurement can provide dose estimates in actual radiation exposure settings, it is not practical to perform a large number of measurements for all study subjects in epidemiologic studies, because the process is usually time-consuming, expensive, and inflexible.</p>
<p>Alternatively, organ doses can be calculated using a computer simulation of the human body (called a computational human phantom) and radiation exposure scenarios combined with Monte Carlo radiation transport techniques. Dr. Lee has developed a series of computational human phantoms that are crucial for realistic, individualized dose reconstruction. His pediatric series of phantoms has been adopted by the ICRP as the international reference model. To estimate more accurate doses, Dr. Lee, in collaboration with the University of Florida, has expanded the computational phantoms include non-reference body sizes utilizing a library of body dimensions representative of the U.S. population.</p>
<h3>Dosimetry for Therapeutic Radiation Procedures</h3>
<p>Quantitative estimation of the risk of developing second cancers related to radiotherapy relies on the quality of the dose estimates to normal tissues. However, there are substantial difficulties in reconstructing organ doses for a large cohort of patients treated years ago. Dr. Lee initiated a research consortium with several universities and clinical centers to develop new dose reconstruction methods for external x-ray radiotherapy using Monte Carlo simulation of radiotherapy machines coupled with his computational human phantoms. He calls this combination the National Cancer Institute dosimetry system for Radiation Treatment (NCIRT). Dr. Lee is applying NCIRT to multiple epidemiological studies of second cancers in radiotherapy patients in collaboration with REB epidemiologists as well as the research consortium. He is also extending NCIRT to include dosimetry methods for proton therapy patients.</p>
<h3>Dosimetry for Diagnostic Radiation Procedures</h3>
<p>Approximately 10 percent of all computed tomography (CT) examinations in the U.S. are performed on pediatric patients, who are at higher risk of radiation-related cancer compared to adults. In order for radiologists to weigh the benefit-harm of conducting such exams, they need a better understanding of the nature and magnitude of the associated health risks. To generate the necessary data to inform such decisions, Dr. Lee has been developing the <a href="https://ncidose.nci.nih.gov/">National Cancer Institute dosimetry system for Computed Tomography (NCICT)</a>, based on Monte Carlo simulation combined with computational human phantoms. To validate the organ dose calculated from NCICT, he compared it with data collected from experiments using physical anthropomorphic phantoms and radiation dosimeters. The software itself has been tested by more than 100 beta testers and utilized for multiple epidemiological studies of CT risk. NCICT is being made available to the scientific community in conjunction with the NCI Technology Transfer Center. Dr. Lee is also developing dosimetry methods and tools for other diagnostic radiation procedures including radiography, fluoroscopically-guided interventional procedures, and nuclear medicine practices.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. McGlynn received an M.P.H. in population studies from Tulane University and a Ph.D. in epidemiology from the University of Pennsylvania. She conducted postdoctoral research on liver cancer at the Fox Chase Cancer Center, where she subsequently served as a faculty member before coming to the NCI in 1998. Dr. McGlynn has been the recipient of an NIH Merit Award for her study of testicular cancer among military servicemen and an NCI Outstanding Mentor Award.</p>
<h2><b>Research Interests</b></h2>
<h3><b>Epidemiology of Testicular and Liver Cancers</b></h3>
<p>The incidence of both testicular cancer and primary liver cancer are increasing in many populations, although there is wide geographic and ethnic variability in their incidence.&nbsp;Dr. McGlynn has been using a variety of study designs to investigate environmental and genetic risk factors that may contribute to the increasing rates.</p>
<h3><b>Testicular Cancer and Testicular Dysgenesis Syndrome</b></h3>
<p>Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) are the most frequently occurring tumors among U.S. men between the ages of 15 and 40 years. Although the incidence has been increasing for decades, the etiology remains poorly understood. TGCT is part of a constellation of male reproductive disorders known as the Testicular Dysgenesis Syndrome (TDS) which also includes cryptorchidism, hypospadias, and impaired spermatogenesis. Because of the interrelationship of these conditions, Dr. McGlynn has been studying a number of TDS outcomes in complementary studies. Her TDS research is currently oriented around several areas of investigation: maternal/son hormonal effects, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and perinatal factors. One of her principal interests in TDS is the relationship of steroid hormones and gonadotropins to the development of TDS outcomes. Thus far, her studies have found little evidence that maternal hormone levels are associated with risk of TDS. Her studies suggest, however, that lower androgen levels during adolescence may predispose risk of developing TGCT. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Ongoing analyses of pre-diagnostic serum samples should provide information on whether hormone levels in adulthood are similarly associated with TGCT. As endocrine disrupting chemicals may affect hormone levels and be related to TGCT, Dr. McGlynn has been studying the relationship of organochlorine compounds to several TDS outcomes. She has identified relationships between TGCT and some pesticides, but has not seen these same relationships with cryptorchidism and hypospadias, suggesting that post-natal, rather than pre-natal, exposure to these compounds may be critical to increasing risk of TGCT. She is currently broadening her research to include endocrine-disrupting chemicals currently in use, and certain medications.</p>
<h3><b>Liver Cancer</b></h3>
<p>Incidence rates of primary liver cancer and its most common histologic type, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), have been increasing in the U.S. for more than 30 years.&nbsp;Although hepatitis C virus (HCV) has certainly played a role in the increase, Dr. McGlynn&rsquo;s research has sought to understand the role of other risk factors.&nbsp;Among the factors in which she has a particular interest are the related conditions of diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome.&nbsp;Her research has shown that the risk of HCC attributable to diabetes and/or obesity is larger than that of any other risk factor, and that risk of liver cancer among men with diabetes is greater than the risk of any other cancer. As diabetes, obesity and metabolic syndrome are often treated pharmacologically, Dr. McGlynn has also been studying whether medications such as non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors,&nbsp;diabetes medications and other drugs affect risk of HCC. To examine the large gender discrepancy in risk of HCC, Dr. McGlynn is focusing on examining hormonal and reproductive factors and endogenous hormone levels. &nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Dr. Amy Berrington is the Branch Chief and senior investigator in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch. She is an internationally recognized expert in the potential cancer risks from medical radiation exposures. Dr. Berrington is co-PI of the UK Pediatric CT scans cohort, which was the first epidemiological study to suggest a direct link between CT scans and subsequent cancer risk. She also leads studies on the risk of second cancer after proton therapy and other emerging radiotherapy techniques. Dr. Berrington is currently a member of the NAS Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board and has participated in many national and international radiation committees. She is an elected member of the American Epidemiological Society and served on the editorial board for the American Journal of Epidemiology. Before joining the NCI in 2008 she held faculty positions at Oxford and Johns Hopkins University.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Radiation exposure to the US population from medical sources has increased six-fold in the last three decades. The overarching goal of Dr. Berrington's research is to quantify the potential cancer risks from this important source of radiation exposure in order to provide information for public health and clinical purposes. Her interdisciplinary training in epidemiology and biostatistics allow her to pursue this goal using both theoretical risk projection modeling and also by conducting epidemiological studies of medically exposed populations. The studies vary across the dose-spectrum from low-dose diagnostic and screening procedures to high-dose radiotherapy, with distinct opportunities and challenges in each area.</p>
<h3>Diagnostic and screening tests</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Berrington has conducted a series of risk projection studies to estimate the potential cancer risks from both diagnostic and screening examinations, including: cardiac stress tests, CT colonography and lung CT screening. To perform these studies she and other collaborators developed the NCI Radiation Risk Assessment Tool (RadRAT), which is interactive computer software that uses state of the art risk projection models to estimate lifetime cancer risks and incorporates Monte Carlo simulation methods to assess the impact of uncertainties in the assumptions and data. She recently became the NCI Principal Investigator for the UK Pediatric CT scans study, which is a retrospective cohort study of 250,000 children who had one or more CT scans as children or adolescents.</p>
<h3>Therapeutic radiation exposure</h3>
<p class="first-graf">As cancer treatment and screening has improved markedly the number of patients diagnosed with a second primary cancer has also increased. Studying the second cancer risks after radiotherapy provides both important clinical information and also insights into the long-term effects of high-dose fractionated radiation exposure. Furthermore, as treatments continue to evolve it is important to study the effects of newer treatments on second cancer rates. Dr. Berrington has conducted a number of studies using the SEER cancer registries to evaluate patterns of second cancers and the second cancer risks related to radiotherapy treatment. She is currently developing a cohort of breast cancer survivors using the electronic medical records from Kaiser Permanente Health Plans to study the late effects of various breast cancer treatments. She is also developing methods to project risks from high-doses of radiation exposure and conducting a pilot study to assess the feasibility of performing the first multi-center study of the second cancer risks from proton therapy and IMRT.</p>

<h2 id="biography"><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Rothman received an A.B. in biochemistry and molecular biology at Harvard College and a M.D. at Northwestern University. At the Johns Hopkins University, he received training in internal medicine, occupational and environmental medicine, and epidemiology. Dr. Rothman joined the NCI in 1990. His research focuses on using biologic markers of exposure, early biologic effect, and genetic susceptibility in epidemiologic studies of occupational and environmental causes of cancer. He is the author of more than 700 publications.</p>
<h2 id="research"><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<h3>Molecular Epidemiology Studies of Occupational and Environmental Causes of Cancer</h3>
<p>Dr. Rothman and colleagues use biomarkers of exposure, early biologic effect, genetic susceptibility, and disease to investigate the carcinogenic potential and mechanism of action of proven or suspected occupational and environmental compounds; to evaluate the influence of inter-individual variation in metabolism on the formation of important early biologic markers, such as cytogenetic aberrations and immunologic alterations; and to assess the risk of premalignant conditions and cancer associated with exposure to occupational and environmental agents. They apply state-of-the-art genomics technologies in their studies including epigenetics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics and whole genome sequencing, and conduct genome-wide association studies (GWAS).</p>
<h3>Benzene and Other Workplace Chemical Exposures</h3>
<p>Benzene is an established human leukemogen, and it may also cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma and other cancers. However, its mechanism of action is uncertain, and its ability to cause cancer at low levels of exposure is unknown. Dr. Rothman carried out a study of healthy workers exposed to high levels of benzene in China to identify mechanistically-based biomarkers that reflect early biologic effects of benzene. They observed an increased frequency of cytogenetic and genetic alterations in peripheral white blood cells (e.g., t8;21, del(5q), del(7q), AML 1/ETO fused transcript). These markers are relevant for leukemia and support the hypothesis that benzene's mechanism of action is mediated through chromosomal damage. An important unanswered question concerns the biologic effect of low exposure levels in the occupational setting and from environmental sources experienced by the general population. In a follow up study, he and his colleagues have applied sensitive, targeted and broad agnostic panels of biomarkers to study the biologic effects of relatively low-level exposure to benzene and reported associations with cytogenetic alterations in cultured myeloid progenitor cells, hematotoxicity, and mRNA changes. Dr. Rothman and colleagues have conducted similarly designed cross-sectional molecular epidemiology studies in healthy workers exposed to TCE and formaldehyde. They are also evaluating the relationship between benzene and myeloid and lymphoid tumors in a large retrospective cohort study in China, two prospective studies in Shanghai, and a large-scale hospital-based case-control study of lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms among Chinese in East Asia (AsiaLymph). In addition, they are evaluating genetic susceptibility for benzene hematotoxicity, lymphoid malignancies in the InterLymph Consortium, and lymphoid and myeloid neoplasms in the AsiaLymph study.</p>
<h3>Aromatic Amines</h3>
<p>Dr. Rothman and colleagues found that among workers in India exposed to the aromatic diamine benzidine, N acetylated benzidine was the predominant DNA adduct in exfoliated urothelial cells. This finding documented that acetylation activates rather than detoxifies benzidine in humans, in contrast to the deactivation role of acetylation for aromatic monoamines, such as 4 aminobiphenyl. He also showed that urine pH, which is influenced primarily by the diet, had a profound influence on DNA adducts levels. This finding is consistent with previous in vitro results that acidic urine hydrolyzes glucuronidated aromatic amines, which enables free compounds to bind DNA. This research indicates that gene-environment interactions can be highly exposure specific, and that nongenetic sources of susceptibility may interact with xenobiotic exposures and play an important role in determining an individual's cancer risk. He has pursued these findings in two large case-control studies of bladder cancer, one in Spain and one in Northern New England, as well as in a large-scale GWAS of bladder cancer and nested case-control studies of white blood cell epigenetic alterations and bladder cancer.</p>
<h3>Organochlorines</h3>
<p class="first-graf">The reasons for the steady increase in the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma since the late 1940s remain mostly unknown. To evaluate exposure to organochlorines (OC), which are ubiquitous environmental contaminants and suspected human carcinogens, on the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Dr. Rothman has conducted three nested case-control studies of prospective cohorts &ndash; in Maryland, Norway, and Eastern Asia. He reported that that PCB levels were associated with subsequent risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in the first two studies, which had study subjects with relatively high levels of PCBs. He has also found suggestive evidence that other OCs may be associated with risk of NHL as well. Dr. Rothman and his colleagues are following up these findings in a large-scale study of NHL in Asia that will be able to study NHL subtype-specific OC effects.</p>
<h3>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs), Nitro-PAHs, and Other Related Chemical Species</h3>
<p>Dr. Rothman and colleagues are investigating the role of PAHs, nitro-PAHs, and related compounds in studies of populations exposed to a variety of combustion-derived particulates including coal, diesel exhaust, and carbon black. They are using cross-sectional molecular epidemiology studies of healthy populations with occupational or environmental exposures to these compounds to provide mechanistic insight. They are also using case-control and nested case-control studies to directly evaluate the carcinogenicity of these compounds using questionnaires linked to extensive exposure databases and biological monitoring in prospective studies.</p>

<p class="first-graf">Joshua Sampson received a B.A. in mathematics and chemistry from Pomona College and an M.S. in biophysical chemistry from Stanford University. He then received his Ph.D. from the Biostatistics Department at the University of Washington in 2007 and spent two years as a postdoctoral fellow in the Yale School of Medicine. He joined the NCI in 2009 as a principal investigator, and was awarded scientific tenure and promoted to senior investigator in December 2016.</p>

<h3><a id="High-Dim-Mediation"></a>High-Dimensional Mediation Analysis</h3>
<p>In epidemiology, a mediation model proposes that the exposure variable (E) of interest impacts a mediator variable M, that then influences (mediates) the outcome Y. The total causal effect of E on Y is then portioned into an indirect (through M) and a direct effect on Y. The goal of mediation analysis is thus to help clarify the true relationship between the exposure and outcome variables. One example is that Body Mass Index (BMI) (E) increases estrogen levels (M) which, in turn, increases the risk of ER+ breast cancer (Y). However, many studies now want to test whether a large panel of biomarkers&mdash;perhaps 100s of metabolites or 100,000s of gene expression levels&mdash;can mediate the relationship between an exposure and an outcome. My goal is to develop statistically powerful methods for identifying individual biomarkers that are mediators, identifying sets of biomarkers that are mediators, and quantifying the indirect effect through these mediators.</p>
<h3><a id="&quot;HPV"></a>HPV Vaccine Trials and HPV Epidemiology</h3>
<p>Cervical cancer affects more than half a million women annually, with 88 percent of mortality occurring in low-income nations. Human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccines were licensed and recommended in the early 2000s, in order to reduce HPV, a necessary cause of cervical carcinogenesis. While initially recommended as a three-dose regimen, there is strong evidence to suggest that a single dose of the vaccine is efficacious at preventing HPV infection. Therefore, the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics is leading observational studies to demonstrate the long-term efficacy of a single dose and, in collaboration with other groups, leading clinical trials to definitively establish the efficacy of a single dose. As part of this effort, my goal has been to develop new statistical methods for vaccine studies with rare events and no placebo-arm, to develop statistically defendable thresholds of non-inferiority, and to lead new trials showing high immunogenicity of a one-dose regimen.</p>
<h3><a id="Cancer-Epidemiology"></a>Cancer Epidemiology</h3>
<p>There is mounting evidence to show that increased physical activity can reduce the risk of cancer. My objective is to develop new methods to define the exact features of physical activity that are associated with the reduction of cancer risk, to understand the biological mechanisms mediating this relationship, and to quantify the error in measures of activity.</p>

<p>Dr. Alter received a B.A. from Radcliffe College and an M.D. from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. She did an internship and residency in Pediatrics at Johns Hopkins, and a fellowship in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at Boston Children's Hospital, as well as a postdoctoral fellowship at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. She is board certified in Pediatrics and in Pediatric Hematology/Oncology, and is a fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics. Her previous faculty appointments include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Assistant and Associate Professor of Pediatrics at Harvard Medical School (1974-79)</li>
<li>Professor of Medicine and of Pediatrics at Mount Sinai School of Medicine (1979-92)</li>
<li>Professor of Pediatrics and of Obstetrics and Gynecology, and Chief of Pediatric Hematology/Oncology at the University of Texas Medical Branch (1992-1999)</li>
</ul>
<p>In 1999, Dr. Alter returned to Johns Hopkins to obtain an M.P.H. and then joined the Clinical Genetics Branch in September 2000. Her research interests are in cancer-prone genetic syndromes, particularly the hematologic bone marrow failure disorders. She has published more than&nbsp;300 peer-reviewed articles, books and book chapters.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Alter developed an interdisciplinary clinical research program, conducting systematic investigations of cancer in the inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (<a href="http://marrowfailure.cancer.gov/">http://marrowfailure.cancer.gov/</a>). The prototype disorder for this program is Fanconi anemia, in which there is a large excess of unusual cancers that occur at atypically early ages, including myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and cancers of the oral cavity and oropharynx, esophagus, cervix and vulva, and liver. Other hematologic conditions with increased occurrences of specific and early cancers include dyskeratosis congenita, Diamond-Blackfan anemia, and Shwachman-Diamond syndrome. This set of disorders serves as a model for the study of mechanisms of cancer development in human populations.</p>
<p>This project involves active, protocol-driven clinical research. Investigations include surveys to determine the incidence and characteristics of cancer in each of the syndromes; case-control studies to identify additional risk factors and perhaps new cancer pathways; genotype/phenotype correlations with reference to cancer susceptibility; heterozygote surveys with regard to the possible relation between the carrier state and cancer; and biologic studies of the tumors to determine their resemblance to their counterparts in the general population. The patients who have these syndromes comprise a group at high risk of cancer which may be suitable for studies of cancer screening and prevention modalities.</p>
<p>This study is open for enrollment.</p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<p>I am interested in the study of the etiology of hormonally-related female cancers, particularly in the molecular mechanisms underlying breast carcinogenesis. My interdisciplinary research program has a special emphasis on the molecular epidemiology of mammographic density, one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer.</p>
<h3>Molecular Epidemiologic Studies of Mammographic Density and Breast Cancer Risk</h3>
<p>The tissue composition of the breast is reflected mammographically by the pattern of distribution of fibroglandular and fatty tissue. A higher component of fat results in lower mammographic density. Conversely, a higher proportion of fibroglandular tissue results in greater density. Studies have consistently demonstrated that high mammographic density is a strong breast cancer risk factor. Therefore, understanding factors that affect mammographic density and their underlying mechanisms are important, yet understudied, research questions.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/breast-cancer/radiology-evaluation-study-tissues-stamp-project">BREAST Stamp Project</a> aims to characterize the radiologic, histologic, and molecular features of dense breast tissue and to understand how the microenvironment of dense breasts promotes neoplastic transformation of the breast epithelium. Data relating mammographic density to molecular markers of breast cancer are limited. To correlate mammographic density to molecular profiles of breast tissues, we are currently leveraging the resources of the <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-case-control-study-poland">Breast Cancer Case-Control Study in Poland</a>, a population-based case-control study conducted in L&oacute;dz and Warsaw from 2000-2003. We have collected mammograms for density assessment from a subset of the study&rsquo;s cancer cases, along with breast tissues that were snap frozen and analyzed using mRNA profiling.</p>
<p>Epidemiologic risk factors strongly associated with mammographic density, such as age and body mass index, explain only about 20% to 30% of the variation in density. The remaining variation in mammographic density is thought to be, in part, genetically determined. We are therefore conducting several investigations designed to address the role of genes in mammographic density. In collaboration with DCEG&rsquo;s Clinical Genetics Branch, we are examining whether mammographic density and computer-extracted mammographic texture pattern features differ by <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutation status.</p>
<p>In addition to addressing how molecular epidemiologic factors may influence mammographic density and its associated breast cancer risk, I am also addressing other ways in which density may relate to breast carcinogenesis. In light of emerging evidence indicating that reductions in mammographic density may predict response to tamoxifen treatment, my colleagues and I&nbsp;initiated a study within Kaiser Permanente Northwest to determine whether breast cancer patients who experience large reductions in density following tamoxifen treatment have an improved prognosis. We have also launched the <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/breast-cancer/ultrasound-study-tamoxifen">Ultrasound Study of Tamoxifen</a>, in which we are using novel ultrasound tomography methods to assess changes in volumetric breast density within the first year of tamoxifen therapy. These studies may provide support for future investigations evaluating change in mammographic density as a &ldquo;biosensor&rdquo; of factors that increase or decrease breast cancer risk.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Charles E. Matthews, Ph.D. is a physical activity epidemiologist and investigator in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=23&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=1033171" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7276782" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="1033171" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="1033171">Metabolic Epidemiology Branch</a>, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute. He received a M.S. in exercise science from the University of South Carolina, Columbia, and a Ph.D. in epidemiology from the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. Dr. Matthews held academic appointments in the Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics at the University of South Carolina and the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine prior to joining DCEG in 2009 as a tenure-track investigator. Dr. Matthews was awarded scientific tenure by NIH in 2016. He is a Fellow of the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and an Associate Editor for the ACSM journal, Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Program</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Matthews studies the relationship between physical activity behaviors and the development of cancer in humans. Physical activity behaviors reflect the continuum of human movement that influences energy expenditure and energy balance, and these behaviors range from purely sedentary (e.g., sitting) to physically active pursuits (e.g., light, moderate-vigorous intensity activities). In his etiologic studies, Dr. Matthews&rsquo; seeks to understand how the full spectrum of physical activity behaviors influences cancer risk, the dose-response relations between active and sedentary behaviors and cancer, and the biological mechanisms underlying these relationships. In his methodological research, Dr. Matthews is working to develop better methods for measuring physical activity behaviors in population-based studies that may help identify new cancer associations and better define the optimal types and amount of physical activity that are associated with reduced risk. This knowledge is critical to the development of evidence-based public health guidelines for physical activity and cancer prevention and control.</p>
<p><i>Cancer Etiology Research</i><br />Dr. Matthews and colleagues conduct research that adds to the evidence-base relating both physically active and sedentary behaviors to risk for developing cancer, as well as prognosis following a cancer diagnosis. For colon, post-menopausal breast, and endometrial cancers, research has shown the benefits of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity to reduce risk. However, our understanding of amount of activity required to achieve risk reduction, the potential benefits of lower intensity activities and the adverse effects of sedentary behaviors remains limited. For all other cancer sites where the evidence is less clear, his research seeks to test the hypothesis that physical activity is associated with reduced risk for these outcomes. In addition, recently he has begun to test the hypothesis that high levels of sedentary behavior (&ldquo;too much sitting&rdquo;) is associated with increased risk for certain cancers, independent of the effect of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Using an integrative epidemiology framework as a guide, Dr. Matthews&rsquo; mechanistic research attempts to expand current understanding of the biological mechanisms linking physical activity behaviors and energy balance to cancer risk. He is exploring the metabolic effects that habitual patterns of physical activity and/or prolonged sedentary time may impart in adults, and future work will also evaluate potential gene-environment interactions between physical activity behaviors and cancer risk. This discovery work has the potential to enhance our understanding of the biological mechanisms mediating the effects of physical activity and energy balance on cancer risk.</p>
<p><i>Methodological Research</i><br />Dr. Matthews&rsquo; methodological research addresses the need for better tools to assess physical activity behaviors in large population-based studies. Self-reported information about active and sedentary behaviors from questionnaires that rely on long-term recall/averaging are known to be prone to measurement error. Errors in these exposure assessments may limit our ability to find important physical activity-cancer associations, and to describe the true dose-response relationships for the associations that we can detect. Dr. Matthews&rsquo; work in this area includes the description of the measurement error structure of existing self-report instruments and the development and testing of new tools for measuring physically active and sedentary behaviors in population-based studies. He is also working to develop infrastructure to support advanced activity monitoring technology in large cancer etiology studies.</p>

<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Prokunina-Olsson received an M.Sc. in Molecular Genetics from Moscow State University, Russia, and a Ph.D. in Medical Genetics from Uppsala University, Sweden. During 2005-2008 she was a visiting fellow with Dr. Francis Collins in the Genome Technology Branch of the National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH. Dr. Prokunina-Olsson joined the Laboratory of Translational Genomics of DCEG as a research fellow in June 2008, became a tenure-track investigator in April 2010, and was awarded NIH scientific tenure and promoted to senior investigator in December 2014. She became Acting Chief of LTG in February 2018 and was appointed as Chief in December 2018. Dr. Prokunina-Olsson has been recognized for her research contributions with an NCI Director&rsquo;s Merit Award, several NCI Innovation and Intramural Research Awards and several awards outside the NIH. She received the DCEG Outstanding Mentor Award in 2017.</p>
<h2 id="research"><a id="Research Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple common germline genetic susceptibility variants that may play a role in a variety of human diseases and outcomes. Dr. Prokunina-Olsson explores the connections between the GWAS-identified genetic susceptibility variants and molecular phenotypes of importance for cancer. Some of her findings resulted in translational and clinical applications.</p>
<h3>Genetics of Bladder Cancer</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Several GWAS for bladder cancer risk in individuals of European ancestry discovered 15 genomic regions with statistically significant associations. In addition to contribution to GWAS efforts, Dr. Prokunina-Olsson leads the post-GWAS analysis of these regions that includes genetic fine-mapping and functional molecular analysis of the candidate genetic variants and genes. In addition to bioinformatics tools, her lab uses a wide range of experimental tools to explore both coding and non-coding genetic variants, such as DNA and RNA sequencing, genotyping, RNA and protein expression, DNA-protein interaction analysis, genome editing, cell culture, epigenetic studies, etc. She is also exploring the regulation of somatic mutagenesis in bladder tumors by germline variants and environmental factors. So far, she has comprehensively explored and published results of her studies on five of 15 GWAS regions associated with bladder cancer risk; the work on other GWAS regions is ongoing.</p>
<h3>Genetics of Infection and Cancer</h3>
<p>Recently, Dr. Prokunina-Olsson&rsquo;s lab has discovered a novel human interferon, IFN-&lambda;4, by performing a follow-up of GWAS findings for clearance of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Chronic HCV is a primary etiological factor for the development of chronic liver disease and liver cancer. Dr. Prokunina-Olsson leads the genetic and functional studies on IFN-&lambda;4 in relation to HCV and several other infections associated with cancer.</p>

<h3>Radiation and Cancer; Etiology of Hematopoietic, Lymphoproliferative, and Primary Brain Cancers</h3>
<p class="first-graf">My research focuses on assessing and quantifying cancer risks linked with occupational, residential, and medical exposures to ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. In a series of investigations, my colleagues and I have examined a wide range of postulated risk factors for hematopoietic, lymphoproliferative, and primary brain neoplasms in adults and children.</p>
<h3>Ionizing Radiation Exposure and Cancer Risks in Radiologic Technologists</h3>
<p class="first-graf">In a collaborative investigation with the University of Minnesota, my colleagues and I have investigated mortality and cancer incidence among a nationwide cohort of 146,022 U.S. radiologic technologists certified 2 or more years during 1926-1982. Using work history questionnaire data provided by 90,000 of the technologists (77% women) during 1983-89 and followed up through 1998, we found no increase in total cancer mortality risks, but a 3-fold excess of breast cancer mortality among those first employed before 1940, modest increases in mortality from the combined grouping of acute myeloid, acute lymphoid, and chronic myeloid leukemia among those first employed prior to 1950, and a 40 percent higher circulatory disease mortality risk among those who first worked before 1940 compared with first working in 1960 or later. Mortality and incidence risks according to work history were similar for breast cancer, and for the combined category of leukemias other than chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Basal cell carcinoma incidence risks were more than 2-fold increased and cutaneous melanoma was also significantly elevated, the latter based on small numbers, for those who first worked before 1940 or before 1950, respectively.</p>
<p>Recently, we have reconstructed doses for individual workers and are currently analyzing incidence risks of cancers and other serious diseases according to individual technologist's occupational and personal radiation doses to specific organs. My colleagues and I are also studying the role of specific molecular and selected genetic factors thought to be directly or indirectly involved in radiation carcinogenesis.</p>
<h3>Non-ionizing Radiation, Extremely Low Frequency and Radiofrequency</h3>
<p class="first-graf">To address public health concerns about risk of childhood leukemia from exposures to extremely low frequency magnetic fields (50 or 60 Hertz), we conducted a large case control study with the Children's Oncology Group (a NCI funded clinical trials cooperative group) and found that neither high measured residential magnetic field levels (except possibly magnetic field levels greater than 0.4 microtesla) nor high wire code levels (a proxy measure for close distance of residence to power lines) were associated with significantly increased risks of childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Exploratory analyses evaluating various alternative magnetic field exposure metrics, did not alter our conclusions. Childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia risks were significantly elevated in offspring whose mothers reported use of an electric blanket during pregnancy, and children with postnatal use of electric blankets, hair dryers, video machines in arcades, and video games connected to televisions. However, patterns for duration or frequency of use of these appliances were inconsistent.</p>
<p>My colleagues and I conducted a large hospital-based case-control study and found that risks of gliomas, meningiomas, and acoustic neuromas were not associated with cumulative use, duration or minutes per day of use of hand-held cellular telephones. In a multi-center population-based study of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, we found that risks of lymphoma were not significantly associated with minutes per week, duration, cumulative lifetime or year of first use of cellular telephones.</p>
<p>Using data from 12 NCI SEER population-based cancer registries, we found that age-specific incidence rates of glioma remained generally constant in 2008, a period coinciding with substantial increase in mobile phone use from 0% to almost 100% of the U.S. population. Comparing observed rates of glioma with projected rates (by combining relatives risks from the two key case-control studies forming the basis of the classification of cell phone use as a possible carcinogen by the International Agency for the search on Cancer, and adjusting for age, registry, sex, data on cell phone use, and various latency periods), we found that projected rates would need to have been 40% higher than those observed in 2008 based on results from the Swedish study by Hardell and colleagues but predicted rates were consistent with observed rates based on results from the 2010 Interphone study.</p>
<h3>Nonionizing Radiation, Ultraviolet or Sunlight Exposures</h3>
<p class="first-graf">My colleagues and I conducted a methodological study to improve the effectiveness of questionnaires in assessing individual UV or sunlight exposures. Comparing assessment of time spent outdoors with an activity-based approach we found higher reproducibility for the activity-based approach during adult ages and over subjects' lifetimes then the time-based approach particularly for women. Currently, we are assessing the extent to which questionnaire-derived data on sunlight exposure and other postulated determinants predict vitamin D levels. We are also studying historical data from NASA (total ozone mapping spectrometer) satellites on UVR ambient exposure in conjunction with questionnaire data on personal exposure to sunlight to assess comprehensively the relationship of UVR with risks for basal cell and squamous cell skin carcinogenesis with USRT.</p>
<h3>Benzene Related Hematopoietic Disorders</h3>
<p class="first-graf">A cohort study of mortality and hematopoietic malignancy incidence risks was carried out among 75,000 benzene exposed workers employed between 1949 and 1987 in 12 cities in China. We found a three fold excess risk for non Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), with risks rising with increasing duration of benzene exposure and associated with benzene exposure more than 10 years prior to diagnosis of NHL. In contrast, a three-fold excess of acute nonlymphocytic leukemia (ANLL) was linked with recent exposures; risk did not vary according to exposure duration. Significantly elevated risks were also seen for myelodysplastic syndromes and aplastic anemia, and there were non-significant excesses of acute lymphoid leukemia and chronic myeloid leukemia, but the numbers of cases were small. Underway is an investigation to extend follow-up of mortality risks foe an additional 12 years (1972-1999).</p>
<p>We are currently conducting a case-cohort study to quantify benzene dose-response risk of hematopoietic malignancies, benzene hematotoxicity, and lung cancer during 1972-1999, and also conducting a molecular and genetic case-control investigation of benzene hematotoxiticity.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Chaturvedi earned a degree in veterinary medicine (1999) from the Andhra Pradesh Agricultural University, India and an M.P.H. (2002) and Ph.D. (2004) in epidemiology from Tulane University. He joined IIB as a postdoctoral fellow in 2005, became a research fellow in 2007, was appointed as a tenure-track investigator in 2009, and was awarded scientific tenure and promoted to senior investigator in November 2016. He joined the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1041183" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1041183" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276769" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1041183">Clinical Epidemiology Unit</a> of the Clinical Genetics Branch in 2017.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Chaturvedi studies the molecular epidemiology of two common cancers&mdash;head and neck cancers and lung cancers. His work addresses research questions on etiology and natural history that have high potential for translation into efforts for screening and early detection of head and neck cancers and lung cancers.</p>
<h3>Head and Neck Cancers</h3>
<p>Head and neck cancers encompass cancers at several anatomic sites, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Oral cavity (lip, oral tongue, gum, floor of mouth, hard palate, and buccal mucosa and other parts of the mouth)</li>
<li>Oropharynx (base of tongue, tonsil, soft palate and uvula, pharyngeal wall, and Waldeyer ring)</li>
<li>Other parts of the pharynx (nasopharynx and hypopharynx)</li>
<li>Larynx</li>
</ul>
<p>Head and neck cancer overall is the eighth most common cancer worldwide, with an estimated annual burden of 686,000 incident cases and 376,000 deaths. Tobacco in the form of smoking and chewing, betel-quid chewing, and alcohol use are established risk factors for all head and neck cancer subsites. Other emerging risk factors for head and neck cancer include poor oral hygiene and low fruit and vegetable consumption. Importantly, research over the past 15 years has identified HPV infection as an etiologic agent for oropharyngeal cancers. It is currently believed that oral cavity and larynx cancers are rarely (&lt;5%) caused by HPV infection.</p>
<p>Given the recent recognition of HPV&rsquo;s etiologic role in oropharyngeal cancer, Dr. Chaturvedi&rsquo;s work addresses the epidemiology of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer as well as the epidemiology and natural history of oral HPV infections. He also studies the unique anatomic, histopathologic, and molecular characteristics of HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancers to understand the reasons underlying the vastly improved survival outcomes for these patients. He addresses these questions through population-based studies in the U.S.</p>
<p>Cancers of the oral cavity are ideal candidates for early detection and secondary prevention given the amenability for visual inspection and specimen collection and the availability of recognized precursor lesions, defined clinically and histologically. Yet, there are currently no guidelines for screening, treatment, or follow-up of patients with oral cancer precursor lesions due to several gaps in the current knowledge base. Dr. Chaturvedi is using a combination of retrospective and prospective cohort studies to address key questions pertaining to the natural history of oral cancer precursor lesions, epidemiologic and molecular predictors of progression of precursor lesions to cancer, methods for screening of oral cancer precursors, and the development of oral cancer risk stratification tools.</p>
<h3>Lung Cancers</h3>
<p>Lung cancer is the most common cancer, with an estimated 1.6 million annual incident cases worldwide and 230,000 cases in the United States. Cigarette smoking is the predominant risk factor for lung cancer, accounting for 80-90% of all lung cancers. Yet, smoking is neither necessary nor sufficient for lung cancer, underscoring the role of additional factors in lung carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Dr. Chaturvedi studies the role of chronic inflammation in the etiology of lung cancer, through the identification of the inflammation mediators and pathways involved in lung carcinogenesis. He also studies the association of chronic inflammation with smoking, the primary lung cancer risk factor, to identify smoking-dependent and smoking-independent components of inflammation involved in lung carcinogenesis. Much of this work is conducted through the measurement of circulating immune/inflammation marker levels in case-control studies nested within large prospective cohorts.</p>
<p>Dr. Chaturvedi also conducts research on the development, validation, and application of lung cancer risk stratification tools, in collaboration with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=17&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349618" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7276766" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349618" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349618">Dr. Hormuzd Katki</a>. In 2011, the landmark National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) showed that, compared with chest radiography, three annual screens with low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) resulted in a 20% reduction in lung cancer mortality among 55-74 year-old smokers with at least 30 pack-years of smoking and no more than 15 years since quitting smoking. Based on these results, LDCT screening is currently recommended for smokers that meet the NLST entry criteria. In the U.S., there are currently 9 million smokers who meet the recommendations for LDCT screening, 20 million smokers in the recommended age range (55-80 years), and 94 million ever smokers of all ages. Given these numbers, as well as the costs and potential harms of LDCT screening, there is a growing recognition in the field to target screening to the highest risk smokers.</p>
<p>Dr. Chaturvedi conducts research on the potential utility of lung cancer risk prediction tools to improve the population-level effectiveness of LDCT screening in the United States. He specifically addresses questions regarding which smokers should be targeted for LDCT screening and how screen-positive individuals should be clinically managed. Additionally, he studies minimally invasive lung cancer biomarkers for improved risk stratification.</p>

<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p class="first-graf">I am leading a research program focused on the molecular etiology and prevention of cervical and other human papillomavirus (HPV)-related cancers, and ovarian and endometrial cancers. I also have special expertise in the p16/Rb pathway, human papillomavirus biology, gene methylation, and molecular profiling of cancers. A strong focus of my work is on moving etiologic discoveries into clinical or public health practice. Several of my studies have the potential to directly affect public health decisions and clinical practice.</p>
<p class="first-graf">I am currently working on several established DCEG studies, and have initiated new field efforts to analyze the etiology of cervical precancers and to improve colposcopy-biopsy protocols. I am also leading consortial efforts to study the etiologic heterogeneity of ovarian cancers.</p>
<h3><strong>Cervical Cancer and Other HPV-related Cancers</strong></h3>
<p class="first-graf">In the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303575" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7317418" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303575" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303575">Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants</a>, my goal is to comprehensively assess biomarkers of risk for progressive cervical neoplasia, and thus develop a new set of biomarkers that can distinguish those at highest risk of cervical cancer from those with benign infection. In the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303576" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7317419" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303576" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303576">Biopsy Study to Improve Detection of Cervical Precancer</a>, my goals are to study cervical disease on the lesion level, to optimize criteria for biopsy placement, and to analyze the incremental benefit of taking multiple biopsies. In the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303577" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7317420" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303577" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303577">Cervical Cancer Screening Among HIV-Infected Women in India</a> and the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=12&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303538" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7317421" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303538" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303538">Anal Precancer and Cancer in HIV-Positive Men (Anal Cancer Screening Study)</a>, I am focusing on evaluation of biomarkers and colposcopy/anoscopy to improve detection of HPV-related diseases in HIV-infected populations.</p>
<p class="first-graf">Based on my long experience with cellular and humoral immune responses against tumor-associated and viral antigens, I am evaluating novel serologic assays to detect HPV antibodies as markers of exposure and protection together with other investigators in HREB and the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) in several DCEG-based studies (Costa Rica Natural History Cohort, Costa Rica Vaccine Trial, ASCUS-LSIL-Triage-Study).</p>
<h3><strong>Ovarian Cancer</strong></h3>
<p class="first-graf">The etiology of ovarian cancer is complex and poorly understood, in part because risk factor associations may differ by histological type, grade and other factors. My focus on ovarian cancers is to understand etiologic heterogeneity by studying risk factor associations and circulating biomarkers in histologic subtypes. I am particularly interested in the role of inflammation in ovarian carcinogenesis, since it could lead to new interventions to prevent or control inflammation.</p>
<p class="first-graf">Together with extramural researchers, I have established the Ovarian Cancer Cohort Consortium (OC3) to allow well-powered studies of risk factors and biomarkers by histologic subtypes. I am conducting tissue based profiling studies in the Ovarian Cancer Case-Control Study in Poland to help improve the understanding of etiologic heterogeneity and to identify cells of origin of ovarian cancers based on molecular profiles of normal reproductive tissues.</p>
<p class="first-graf">In collaboration with investigators in the Biostatistics Branch, we are extending our analyses to cases from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Residual Tissue Repository (SEER RTR). I am analyzing several <i>a priori</i> markers and pathways, such as mismatch repair deficiency, <i>p53</i> and p16/Rb alterations, and telomere length alterations. We seek to identify markers that can be integrated with standardized histological typing and grading to improve the classification of ovarian tumors for epidemiologic studies. We also want to identify markers for early detection that can be translated into clinical or screening applications. In collaboration with investigators in the Clinical Genetics Branch and with outside clinical partners, we are evaluating novel techniques for sampling of endometrial and ovarian epithelium, as well as fallopian tubes.</p>
<h3>Endometrial Cancer</h3>
<p>My main focus on endometrial cancer research is to characterize cancer precursors and to develop early detection biomarkers. In a study to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303581" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7317422" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303581" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303581">evaluate biomarkers in samples collected using endometrial brushings and intravaginal tampons</a>, my colleagues and I identified several candidate markers that showed good performance to identify women with endometrial cancer. I am now conducting a large prospective study to evaluate methylation and mutation markers to identify endometrial cancers and cancer precursors.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Jill Koshiol received her Ph.D. in epidemiology from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Public Health in 2005. Subsequently, she joined the Genetic Epidemiology Branch of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics as a Cancer Prevention Fellow. Dr. Koshiol joined the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch as a research fellow in 2008 and became an Earl Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator in 2010.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Koshiol has focused her research program on hepatobiliary cancers, which are linked to both infections and inflammation. Biliary tract cancers are rare in much of the world, but there are hotspots where these cancers constitute a major public health burden. Because these cancers are rare in the developed world, their etiology is poorly understood, even with respect to classic cancer risk factors. Biliary tract cancers have a multifactorial etiology, and inflammation is likely central in the carcinogenesis process. Dr. Koshiol&rsquo;s work is identifying previously unknown risk factors, such as aflatoxin. Identification of such determinants, as well as biomarkers, may lead to new opportunities for cancer prevention and early detection that can be translated into public health impact, particularly in high-risk areas.</p>
<p>Chile is one such high-risk area. Gallbladder cancer (GBC) is a leading cause of cancer death in Chilean women. To investigate the epidemiologic and molecular predictors of gallbladder dysplasia and cancer, Dr. Koshiol initiated the Chile Biliary Longitudinal Study (Chile BiLS). The very high rates of GBC and gallstones in Chile provide a unique opportunity to test several emerging hypotheses that are difficult to examine in other populations.</p>
<p>Dr. Koshiol is also the principal investigator for the Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study and leads the Biliary Tract Cancer Pooling Project and the Cholecystectomy Risk Stratification (CRS) study. In addition, she collaborates on the REVEAL-HBV and -HCV studies of individuals with chronic hepatitis B and C infection. Using these studies and others, she plans to elucidate hepatobiliary cancer etiology and aid cancer prevention through the identification of cancer-related molecular pathways and targets.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Loud received her B.S. in Nursing from Old Dominion University in 1981, followed by an M.S. in Nursing from George Mason University in 1992 and a Doctor of Nursing Practice from the University of Maryland, Baltimore in 2008. She has been a board-certified Adult Nurse Practitioner since 1992. She spent six years as a Nurse Practitioner with NCI's Medical Oncology Branch, working with individuals enrolled in clinical trials of new cancer treatments. During that time, she was a Clinical Trials Coordinator, and an Associate Investigator on two chemoprevention trials for women at increased risk of breast cancer. This led to an interest in cancer genetics, in pursuit of which she has taken both the Basic and the Advanced Course for Nurses in Genetic Cancer Risk Counseling at the Fox Chase Cancer Center. She joined the Clinical Genetics Branch in 2000, where she is currently involved in multiple clinical and epidemiologic studies aimed at understanding hereditary cancer and at better understanding the psychosocial impact of individuals identified as being at high genetic risk of cancer. In September 2008, Dr. Loud was appointed Assistant Branch Chief, Clinical Genetics Branch. She is also a member of NCI's Clinical Center Institutional Review Board and of the Gynecologic Oncology Group Nursing Committee.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Current research interests include assessing the impact of risk identification and risk management as they affect various aspects of an at-risk individual's life, with a particular focus on hereditary breast and ovarian cancer. Dr. Loud is also a co-investigator on CGB's Familial Testicular Cancer study, and the National Ovarian Cancer Prevention and Early Detection study (GOG-199). As CGB investigates the clinical implications of carrying mutations in cancer susceptibility genes, and develops novel approaches to risk management, she also hopes to learn how these strategies affect individuals and their families. She is studying how specific factors impact complex decisions related to cancer risk assessment, cancer risk communication, and activities of cancer prevention and control made by individuals at increased risk of cancer.</p>

<h2>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Kleinerman received a B.A. from Washington University, an M.P.H. from Boston University School of Public Health, and a Ph.D. from the University of London, U.K. Dr. Kleinerman joined the NCI Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program in 1979. Currently, she is Deputy Branch Chief of the Radiation Epidemiology Branch. As lead of the large follow-up study of late effects in adult survivors of retinoblastoma with a focus on the risk of second cancers, Dr. Kleinerman identified for the first time that hereditary retinoblastoma survivors with an inherited germline <i>RB1</i> mutation are at higher risk of a second cancer, especially melanoma, compared to hereditary retinoblastoma survivors with a <i>de novo</i> germline <i>RB1</i> mutation. She has received the NIH Merit Award as well as two NCI DCEG awards for Outstanding Research Paper by a Staff Scientist based on her research on retinoblastoma survivors. Through her research, she has identified new risks of specific second cancers in retinoblastoma survivors. Her interest in second cancers has led her to collaborate on a large study of second gastrointestinal cancers following radiotherapy for cervical cancer, which builds on her earlier research on second cancers following radiation for cervical cancer.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<ul class="grey-bullets">
<li>Gene-environment interaction in retinoblastoma patients</li>
<li>Interventional radiation and fluoroscopically-guided procedures</li>
<li>Second gastrointestinal cancers following radiotherapy</li>
</ul>
<h3>Retinoblastoma</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Children with hereditary retinoblastoma (Rb) are at exceptionally high risk of sarcomas, melanoma and brain tumors due to a germline mutation in their <i>RB1</i> gene,especially those with an inherited germline mutation. Radiotherapy used to treat these patients has enhanced the risk of these cancers. In collaboration with the Human Genetics Program, we continue to investigate cancer incidence and mortality in a series of 1,850 one-year survivors of RB to learn whether these patients continue to be at risk of sarcomas as they age as well as typical epithelial tumors of adulthood. We identified a striking excess of leiomyosarcomas in patients 35 years and later after Rb diagnosis. Efforts are underway to identify specific mutations in the <i>Rb1</i> gene in hereditary patients who develop sarcomas and melanomas. We created a website to inform study participants about the risks of second cancers and provide cancer screening recommendations. <a href="http://rbstudy.cancer.gov/">Retinoblastoma Follow-Up Study</a></p>
<h3><b>Cancer mortality in physicians conducting fluoroscopically-guided procedures</b></h3>
<p class="first-graf">During the past few decades, there has been dramatic growth in the number of high-dose diagnostic x-ray examinations and fluoroscopically&ndash;guided (FG) procedures, primarily performed by interventional cardiologists and interventional radiologists. These complex procedures use long and on-time radiological imaging, resulting in high radiation exposure not only to patients but also to physicians. Cancer mortality has not been investigated in physicians exposed to radiation from FG procedures We are conducting the first comprehensive mortality study of radiologists, cardiologists and other physicians performing these procedures to determine their risk of dying from cancer. A large cohort of radiologists and other physicians exposed to radiation has been assembled to determine cause of death compared to physicians who are not exposed to radiation.</p>

<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. O'Brien received undergraduate and medical degrees from the University of Michigan, and an M.P.H. from the Harvard School of Public Health. He was an Epidemic Intelligence Service Officer and Medical Epidemiologist with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention before joining the NIH Intramural Research Program in 1992. His primary research interests have involved studies on the transmission and natural history of oncogenic viruses, including human immunodeficiency virus type 1, hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus (HCV).</p>
<h2><a id="Research"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s research program targets viruses that cause cancer, especially hepatitis C virus, through interdisciplinary studies that emphasize human genetics. He focuses on studies that may translate into clinical or public health benefits. Dr. O&rsquo;Brien organized a trans-disciplinary group of investigators to refine understanding of the genetic basis for spontaneous HCV clearance and response to treatment for chronic hepatitis C. This collaboration led to the discovery of interferon lambda 4 (<em>IFNL4</em>), a novel gene that appears to underlie observed differences in HCV clearance (Prokunina-Olsson et al, <em>Nature Genetics</em>, 2013). His current work focuses on <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=1140233&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1140233" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7280136">hepatitis viruses</a>, hepatocellular carcinoma and <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=1140677&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1140677" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7280137">phenotypic expressions of the <em>IFNL4</em> genotype</a>.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Sinha received a B.S. with honors and M.SC. in biochemistry from the University of Stirling in Scotland, and a Ph.D. in nutritional sciences from the University of Maryland. She began work at the NCI in the Laboratory of Cellular Carcinogenesis and Tumor Promotion in 1987, was selected as a Cancer Prevention Research Fellow in 1990, and later joined the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics in 1992. Dr. Sinha was promoted to senior investigator in 2001 and co-principal investigator of the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. She served for many years as Deputy Chief of the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch.</p>
<p>Dr. Sinha was awarded a fellowship from the Japanese Foundation for Cancer Research in 2001 and 1997, Sigma Xi Distinguished Lectureship 2005; and in 2007 was invited to present at the prestigious 38th International Princess Takamatsu Symposium, Tokyo, Japan. She has received the NIH Award of Merit, Technology Transfer Award, DCEG Special Appreciation Award, and several performance awards. Dr. Sinha was one of the founding members of the steering committee of the Molecular Epidemiology Group of the American Association for Cancer Research from 1997-1998, and of the Nutritional Epidemiology Research Group of the American Society of Nutritional Sciences from 1998-2000. She was a member of the working group for the IARC Monograph on the Evaluation of Carcinogenic Risks to Humans, (Volumes 92, 114, 116), and was a reviewer for the American Institute for Cancer Research/World Cancer Research Fund report <em>Food, Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Prevention of Cancer</em> (2007 and 1997 editions). As an expert in the field of nutritional epidemiology, Dr. Sinha regularly chairs international committees and sessions at national meetings, as well as organizes meetings, symposia, and workshops. She was the president of the 8th International Conference on Carcinogens and Mutagenic&ndash;substituted Aryl Compounds and edited a special issue of <em>Mutation Research &ndash; Fundamental and Molecular Mechanisms</em> in 2002. She serves on the Editorial Board of <em>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention</em>, and the journal of the Japanese Cancer Association, <em>Cancer Science</em>.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Sinha conducts interdisciplinary research to elucidate the dietary exposures and biological mechanisms associated with cancer risk, including the role of the microbiome.</p>
<h3>Diet and Cancer</h3>
<p class="first-graf">Only a small number of dietary components are convincingly linked causally to cancer, even though diet is thought to be important in the etiology of human cancers. The goal of our research is to explain the complex role of diet in cancer etiology, using an interdisciplinary approach that integrates biological mechanisms with epidemiologic studies. An aim of the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch is to improve dietary exposure assessment using questionnaires and novel biochemical measures to elucidate dietary exposures and biological mechanisms associated with cancer risk, including the role of genetic susceptibility. Dr. Sinha is particularly interested in examining the role of meat, poultry, and fish in relation to cancer risk. She also studies non-nutritive constituents of diet, e.g., <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302637" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302637" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7252815" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302637">carcinogens formed during the cooking process</a> and chemopreventive properties of coffee.</p>
<h3>Dietary Cohort in Asian Populations</h3>
<p>Asia is undergoing marked changes in diet, lifestyle, and chronic disease patterns. Dietary characteristics unique to Asia may be of particular interest. In high-income societies, over one-third of cancers are believed to be attributable to potentially modifiable, lifestyle-related exposures, such as diet, physical activity, and obesity. However, the relationship between diet and cancer risk within Asians are largely unexplored, despite the startling prevalence of diet-related conditions that may affect cancer and chronic disease risk, such as insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. Dr. Sinha is actively involved in dietary studies in the Asian Cohort Consortium.</p>
<h3>Role of Gut Microflora and Health</h3>
<p>An evolving hypothesis is that dysbiosis, which is maladaptation of the commensal human microbial community, may contribute to disease development. Furthermore, cancer may be caused or prevented from an interplay between diet, gut bacteria, and microbial metabolites. To date, there are few well-conducted epidemiologic studies evaluating the role of the human microbiota and its related metabolites in cancer development.</p>
<p class="first-graf">Dr. Sinha&rsquo;s vision is to advance epidemiologic research on the microbiome in both extra- and intramural programs. She has taken a four-pronged approach to achieve this vision: (1) conducting methods studies to develop best practices including methods for collecting specimens, developing quality control standards, extracting and sequencing DNA, comparing different bioinformatics pipelines, and conducting statistical analyses; (2) incorporating fecal and oral collection into new or existing cohorts; (3) evaluating associations of cancer risk factors, such as body mass index and diet, with the microbiome and metabolome; and (4) conducting etiologic studies.</p>

<p>Dr. Steven Moore earned his Ph.D. in cancer epidemiology from Yale University School of Public Health.&nbsp;He joined the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch of the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics as a predoctoral fellow in 2005 and became a research fellow in 2009. Dr. Moore was appointed as an Earl Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator in 2013. In the newly formed <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=23&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=1033171" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7276871" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033171" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="1033171">Metabolic Epidemiology Branch</a>, Dr. Moore investigates the role of physical activity and obesity in the development of cancer. He has received a number of awards for his work in this area, including a DCEG Fellowship Achievement Award, as well as the Karen Hornbostel Memorial Award from the American College of Sports Medicine.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<h4>Physical Activity, Obesity, and Cancer</h4>
<p>Dr. Moore&rsquo;s research focuses on the role of obesity-related factors on cancer risk, including waist circumference, sedentary behavior, and physical activity. He is exploring these questions in large population-based studies, such as the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort, and within the NCI Cohort Consortium, a group which has pooled data from nearly two million individuals. Dr. Moore seeks to establish the reduction in cancer rates that would occur if all people were more physically active, including for rare cancers and specific cancer subtypes. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Metabolomics and Cancer</h4>
<p>Dr. Moore is a pioneer in the field of metabolomics, which applies novel high-throughput technology to analyze small-molecule metabolites in biospecimens, like blood or urine, as a way to understand how molecular pathways may influence cancer risk. In studying the metabolomics of energy balance, he has been instrumental in uncovering biomarkers for body mass index and diet. Dr. Moore is leading studies to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways involved in breast cancer and is a lead collaborator on studies of colorectal and pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>Dr. Moore is chair of the Consortium of Metabolomics Studies (<a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/comets/">COMETS</a>), an international consortium of prospective cohort studies that uses metabolomics to identify risk factors for chronic disease.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Lisa Mirabello earned her Ph.D. in biomedical sciences with a focus on molecular population genetics and infectious disease from the University at Albany School of Public Health, State University of New York in 2007. She joined the Clinical Genetics Branch of the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics as a postdoctoral Cancer Genetics research fellow in 2007, was promoted to research fellow in 2010,&nbsp;was appointed as an Earl Stadtman&nbsp;Investigator in 2013, and was awarded NIH scientific tenure and promoted to senior investigator&nbsp;in 2019.&nbsp;Dr. Mirabello's&nbsp;research program is focused on genetic susceptibility to pediatric cancer and the genomics of HPV carcinogenicity. Dr. Mirabello has received a number of awards for her work in this area, including five DCEG Intramural Research Awards and three NCI Director&rsquo;s Intramural Innovation Awards.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<h4>Pediatric Cancer Genomics-Osteosarcoma</h4>
<p>Osteosarcoma is the most common primary, malignant bone tumor among children and adolescents. Osteosarcoma etiology has remained poorly characterized, and metastatic disease has a poor prognosis. Dr. Mirabello is using epidemiologic studies to examine incidence patterns and identify risk groups for this rare cancer. She is using whole-genome approaches, including large genome-wide association studies and whole-exome sequencing, to comprehensively explore the relationship between genetic variation and susceptibility to osteosarcoma. Dr. Mirabello and her colleagues have completed the first international, multi-institution genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of osteosarcoma risk. She continues to conduct large genomic epidemiologic studies of osteosarcoma, and other pediatric cancers, to broadly seek novel germline genetic markers of disease risk.</p>
<p>Metastasis is responsible for approximately 90% of cancer deaths. Dr. Mirabello is interested in discovering genes and biological pathways, which could potentially lead to new strategies for early detection and treatment. She conducted the first GWAS of osteosarcoma metastasis, and with functional studies, identified a novel locus strongly linked to metastatic disease. Her work is focused on determining the role of germline genetic variation in metastatic disease and identifying genetic markers of adverse patient outcomes.</p>
<p><strong>Carcinogenic HPV Genomics</strong></p>
<p>Thirteen human papillomavirus (HPV) types cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer and a large proportion of other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers. HPV is a common, sexually-transmitted infection, but only a small fraction of infected women progress to developing cervical precancer or cancer. Little is known about why only certain infections progress. There is huge variability in risk conferred by the different carcinogenic HPV types and, remarkably, strong differences even between closely related variant lineages within each type.</p>
<p>Dr. Mirabello is studying a large number of whole-genome sequences of carcinogenic HPV types from precancer/cancer cases and controls to understand the viral genetic basis of HPV carcinogenesis using a novel high-throughput HPV next-generation sequencing assay. HPV type 16 causes approximately half of all cervical cancers worldwide and causes most other HPV-related cancers. A primary focus of this <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=491113&amp;sys_revision=11&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="491113" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_siteid="475" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7374915">HPV genomics project</a> is to evaluate why HPV 16 is so much more carcinogenic than closely related HPV types, and to evaluate HPV16 variants related to within type risk differences. Dr. Mirabello has evaluated HPV whole-genome sequences from over 15,000 high-risk HPV-positive women with benign infections or cervical precancer/cancer and has made several novel observations regarding HPV epidemiology and the uniquely high carcinogenicity of HPV 16.</p>

<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Koutros received her M.P.H. and Ph.D. in epidemiology from Yale University. She completed her doctoral work through the Yale-NCI partnership training program in cancer epidemiology, conducting research in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB). In 2008, upon completion of her doctorate, she became a fellow in OEEB; she was appointed to the position of tenure-track investigator in 2015.</p>
<h2 class="dceg-bio-content"><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Koutros&rsquo;s research involves the design and conduct of epidemiologic investigations to evaluate occupational exposures as risk factors for cancer. She employs state-of-the-art exposure assessment methods and molecular studies within highly exposed populations to identify the etiology and clarify the biological mechanisms underlying chemical-induced carcinogenesis. Areas of interest include exposures occurring in the workplace and those contributing to the etiology of bladder cancer.</p>
<h3>Occupation and Industry-based Exposures</h3>
<p>Dr. Koutros leads several efforts in large occupation and industry-based cohort studies studying the impact of high levels of exposure to several important chemicals that have large public health and regulatory concerns. Specific areas of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pesticide exposures as risk factors for cancer. Areas of focus include exposure to specific organophosphate insecticides and risk for aggressive prostate cancer and bladder cancer as well as the interaction between agricultural pesticide use and genetic susceptibility on cancer risk.</li>
<li>Acrylonitrile and cancer mortality. Areas of focus include suggested elevated risks for cancers of the lung and bladder among acrylonitrile-exposed workers.</li>
<li>Diesel exhaust and cancer mortality in a cohort of workers exposed to diesel exhaust at eight U.S. non-metal mining facilities.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Bladder Cancer</h3>
<p>Occupational exposures are a leading risk factor for bladder cancer, second only to smoking. Dr. Koutros is currently leading efforts within large case-control studies of bladder cancer to identify important occupational exposures that might influence risk. Dr. Koutros and her collaborators are examining potential gene-environment interactions as well as incorporating important somatic variation and bladder tumor marker data to integrate exposure, germline genetic variation, and somatic changes to gain insights into the etiology of bladder carcinogenesis.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="Biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Vladimir Drozdovitch is a radiation physicist and part of the Dosimetry Unit and Chernobyl Research Unit in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB). Dr. Drozdovitch received an M.S. in nuclear physics from the Belarusian State University in Minsk, Belarus, and a Ph.D. in nuclear physics from the Belarusian Academy of Sciences. Previously, he was scientist at the Research Institute for Radiation Medicine in Minsk and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France. He joined the Radiation Epidemiology Branch as a visiting fellow in 2006 and became a staff scientist in 2014.</p>
<h2 id="Research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Drozdovitch&rsquo;s main scientific interests include radiation dosimetry and dose reconstruction methods and analysis of uncertainties associated with radiation doses. Within the REB, he leads the dosimetry calculation effort for studies of the Chernobyl accident, leads efforts to estimate historical doses from nuclear medicine in a nationwide cohort of the U.S. Radiologic Technologists (USRT), and is involved in studies to evaluate exposure and risk from radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing.</p>
<h2>Studies related to the Chernobyl accident</h2>
<p>In the Chernobyl-related cohort study of thyroid cancer and other diseases, conducted jointly with the Ministries of Health of Ukraine and Belarus, Dr. Drozdovitch is responsible for conducting and overseeing the dosimetry for the thyroid screening studies, the Belarusian <i>in utero</i> cohort, and the study of Ukrainian clean-up workers, including a case-control study of thyroid cancer and an investigation into germline mutations in the offspring of those workers. He assesses uncertainties in the doses by accounting for shared and unshared errors and collaborates with statisticians on the incorporation of uncertainties into the risk estimates. He also continues to conduct and support characterization of uncertainties in dosimetry for the IARC case-control study of thyroid cancer in Belarus and Russia.</p>
<h2>USRT study</h2>
<p>Dr. Drozdovitch is the lead dosimetrist on the nuclear medicine component of the USRT cohort. These technologists currently receive some of the highest occupational radiation doses of any medical workers. He has collected historical data, reviewed current practice standards and developed cutting edge methods to reconstruct doses from radioisotope diagnostic procedures.</p>
<h2>Fallout studies</h2>
<p>Dr. Drozdovitch has been a key researcher in the dosimetry effort for a study of thyroid nodules among persons in Kazakhstan who were exposed to radioactive fallout resulting from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests carried out at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site between 1949 and 1962. Information to estimate doses is based, in large part, on the analysis of historical behavior and food consumption. As part of a multi-disciplinary team, Dr. Drozdovitch set up and conducted focus-group sessions in Kazakhstan and incorporated those data in a complex 2-dimentional Monte Carlo dosimetry system. He also provides dosimetry support to the INSERM (France) case-control study of thyroid cancer in persons exposed to fallout resulting from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted in French Polynesia between 1966 and 1974.</p>
<h2>Assessment of uncertainties in doses</h2>
<p>Dr. Drozdovitch has successfully worked to evaluate the uncertainties in exposure assessment, which involves the separation of shared and unshared errors, and of the errors related to stochastic variability and to lack of knowledge. He has initiated studies to evaluate uncertainties due to human factors in dosimetry for clean-up workers in Ukraine and estimate the reliability of questionnaire based dose reconstruction in Belarusian thyroid screening cohort.</p>

<p>Dr. Michael Dean is a senior investigator in the Laboratory of Translational Genomics. He obtained his Ph.D. from the Biochemistry Department at the Boston University School of Medicine. He performed his postdoctoral studies at the National Cancer Institute, Center for Cancer Research (CCR), on the <i>MET</i> oncogene and cystic fibrosis gene. He is a member of the American Society of Human Genetics, Centre d'Etude du Polymorphisme Humaine (CEPH), the Human Genome Organization (HUGO), and an adjunct faculty member at Hood College. Before joining DCEG in 2015, Dr. Dean led the Human Genetics Section of the Cancer and Inflammation Program within CCR.</p>
<h2 id="Research Interests">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Dean is broadly interested in inherited (germline) genetic variation, somatic mutations in tumors, and the combined effect of both on cancer risk, progression, and response to therapy. While part of CCR, Dr. Dean participated in cloning genes (<i>PTCH</i>, <i>VHL</i>) involved in inherited cancers; characterized common variants associated with cancer; and sequenced the genomes of tumors to identify genes commonly altered. In the LTG, Dr. Dean is continuing his work on unlocking the mechanisms through which genetic alterations affect cancer risk. By evaluating the genetic factors of tumor as well as host, Dr. Dean is determining new biomarkers for early detection and treatment. He also&nbsp;continues his investigations into the genetic components of cancer health disparities in the U.S. and in Latin America.</p>
<h3>Association to Function</h3>
<p>Genome-wide association studies have been completed on most major cancer types and have revealed many chromosome regions that influence cancer risk. We have focused on a region including the <i>MSMB</i> and <i>NCOA4</i> genes associated with prostate cancer, and demonstrated complex regulation of expression and splicing of these genes. We are also studying variations associated with renal cancer risk to understand their function.</p>
<h3>Tumor Genomes</h3>
<p>All cancer is genetic in the sense that all tumors have genetic alterations not present in normal tissue of the person with cancer. We have sequenced the exome (coding portion of the genome) of tumors from the bladder, cervical, kidney, prostate, and adrenal gland. These data have identified potential markers for early diagnosis and targets of therapy, and many somatic mutations of the genes involved in histone modification and chromatin remodeling. We will continue to explore these areas focusing on samples from the many large cohorts that DCEG has assembled. By studying samples with detailed epidemiological data, we hope to better apply genetics and genomics to understanding cancer.</p>
<h3>Global Health and Cancer</h3>
<p>Cancer is increasingly a global health problem. We have established studies of cervical and breast cancer in Guatemala, Nicaragua, Mexico and Venezuela, which are yielding important genetic differences as well as potential environmental factors.</p>
<p>For common cancers among adults, we are investigating the reasons behind the very high rates of cervical cancer in the region. We apply a molecular and genomic approach to this question, analyzing cancer tissue, blood samples, and standard epidemiological information on cases as well as genome sequencing. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dr. Purdue received a Ph.D. in epidemiology from the University of Toronto, Canada. He joined DCEG in 2004 as a postdoctoral fellow within the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, was appointed as a tenure-track investigator in 2009, and was awarded NIH scientific tenure in 2017. He has received several awards for his research in molecular epidemiology, including DCEG and NIH Fellowship Achievement awards, the&nbsp;DCEG Intramural Research Award, and the NIH Merit Award.</p>
<h2 id="Research Interests"><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Purdue&rsquo;s interests center on applying molecular and classical epidemiologic methods to study the causes of cancer and improve exposure assessment. He is particularly interested in evaluating the potential carcinogenicity of chlorinated solvents and investigating the etiology of kidney cancer and lymphomas.</p>
<h3>Chlorinated Solvents</h3>
<p>Chlorinated solvents are manmade compounds widely used across different industries for a variety of applications. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified trichloroethylene (TCE), commonly used in vapor degreasing in the past, as a (Group 1) human carcinogen affecting kidney cancer, and the widely used dry cleaning solvent perchloroethylene (&ldquo;Perc&rdquo;, also known as tetrachloroethylene) as a probable human carcinogen (Group 2A).</p>
<p>Dr. Purdue is leading case-control and cohort investigations to clarify whether TCE is a human carcinogen at sites other than the kidney, and whether Perc and other chlorinated solvents are human carcinogens at any site.&nbsp; He is also conducting molecular epidemiologic research to elucidate exposure-related biologic mechanisms relevant to cancer.</p>
<h3>Kidney Cancer</h3>
<p>Investigations of kidney cancer etiology make up a large part of Dr. Purdue&rsquo;s research program. His leadership in organizing genome-wide association studies have produced seminal contributions to our understanding of genetic susceptibility for this malignancy. In other kidney cancer research, Dr. Purdue has been evaluating suspected occupational risk factors, investigating possible factors underlying the excess of this disease among Black vs. White Americans, and exploring the existence of etiologic heterogeneity across histologic and molecular subtypes.</p>
<h3>Lymphomas</h3>
<p>While severe immune dysregulation is an established risk factor for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), it is unclear whether subtle, subclinical immune system function influences lymphomagenesis in the general population. Dr. Purdue has been conducting investigations of serum immune markers and NHL within prospective cohorts to address this research question. He is also conducting research to better understand serum markers associated with risk of multiple myeloma (MM), a highly lethal B-cell malignancy, including investigations into markers predictive of future progression to MM from its asymptomatic precursor, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance.</p>

<h3 id="Biography">Biography</h3>
<p>Dr. Montserrat Garc&iacute;a-Closas investigates the causes of cancer with the aim of improving risk assessment tools that can aid the development of targeted screening and risk reduction strategies for personalized prevention. She carries out a multidisciplinary research program on the molecular epidemiology of breast and bladder cancers, and has made important contributions to the understanding of genetic susceptibility and etiologic heterogeneity of these malignancies.</p>
<p>As Deputy Director for the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) she focuses not only on her own research interests, but also on the management of the broad scientific program of the Division. She was appointed Acting Chief of the Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch in 2016.</p>
<p>Dr. Garc&iacute;a-Closas received her M.D. from the University of Barcelona, Spain, a Master of Public Health in quantitative methods, and a Doctorate of Public Health in epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health. She joined DCEG in 1996 as a postdoctoral fellow, became a tenure-track investigator in 1999 and a tenured senior investigator in 2007. From 2008-2010, she was a visiting scientist at the Department of Oncology and Strangeways Laboratory, Cambridge University, U.K. In 2010, she became a Professor of Epidemiology at the Division of Genetic and Epidemiology of the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR), University of London, U.K.</p>
<p>She is the recipient of several awards including two NIH Merit Awards, an NCI Intramural Research Award, and an NCI Mentor of Merit Award. She has also served in numerous expert committees including the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) Molecular Epidemiology Working Group (MEG), the U.K. MEG and the Advisory Committee on NHS Breast Cancer Screening, England. She is a founder member of several large consortia, served as the Chair of the Coordinating Committee for the International Consortium of Case-Control Studies of Bladder Cancer from 2005-2011, and co-Chairs the Pathology and Survival Working Group of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC), a major breast cancer consortium.</p>
<h3 id="Research Interests">Research Interests</h3>
<p>Dr. Garc&iacute;a-Closas employs a multidisciplinary approach to identify biomarkers of breast and bladder cancer risk in combination with questionnaire-based information collected from large epidemiological studies. Specific areas of interest include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Molecular characterization of tumors to identify exposure signatures and subtype-specific causes of cancer</li>
<li>Identification of biomarkers of risk, including genetic and epigenetic changes</li>
<li>Integration of biomarkers and other risk factors into cancer risk prediction models, and evaluation of their utility in risk stratification to inform personal and public health decisions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Breast Cancer</h3>
<p>In the study of breast cancer etiology, Dr. Garc&iacute;a-Closas is co-leader of large-scale molecular pathology studies within BCAC. She has contributed to the development of one of the largest, centralized collection of breast tumor tissue with detailed data on risk factors and clinical outcomes. This resource has revealed important tumor markers that delineate the etiologic heterogeneity of breast cancer. At the ICR, she co-led the Breakthrough Generations Study, a large prospective cohort study of over 110,000 women in the U.K. aimed at evaluating risk factors for breast cancer.</p>
<p>As an investigator in the ongoing international genotyping project, OncoArray, Dr. Garc&iacute;a-Closas seeks to identify inherited susceptibility loci associated with specific subtypes of breast cancer. OncoArray uses a custom microarray chip of 500,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in over 100,000 breast cancer cases drawn from multiple studies from around the world.</p>
<p>In addition, she is one of the lead investigators in a large-scale project embedded in BCAC that will be characterizing thousands of breast tumors using targeted DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry and <em>in-situ</em> hybridization analysis. Through the study of how genetic and environmental risk factors, tumor features and clinical progression interrelate, this effort will provide critical information for the development and validation of integrated risk and prognostic models.</p>
<p>To identify novel biomarkers, Dr. Garc&iacute;a-Closas is also conducting an epigenetic-wide association study (EWAS) of breast cancer using pre-diagnostic DNA samples from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ultimate goal of this research is to facilitate the development and implementation of targeted prevention and screening strategies for different types of breast cancer.</p>
<h3>Bladder Cancer</h3>
<p>Dr. Garc&iacute;a-Closas investigates the combined effects of genetic and environmental risk factors for bladder cancer. She published the definitive study of the interaction between smoking history and the <em>NAT2</em> genotype, which is one of the few consistent gene-environment interactions described to date. She has made important contributions to the discovery of novel susceptibility loci for bladder cancer using genome-wide association studies (GWAS), an area where she continues to collaborate. In addition, she is engaged in an EWAS of bladder cancer in the PLCO Study to identify additional biomarkers of risk.</p>

<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Olusegun (Segun) Onabajo received a Bachelor of Pharmacy degree from the Obafemi Awolowo University, Nigeria and a Ph.D. in cell biology and molecular genetics from the University of Maryland, College Park in 2008. He received postdoctoral training at the University of Maryland Medical School in Baltimore and the Uniformed Services University for the Health Sciences in Bethesda. In May 2013, Dr. Onabajo joined the group of <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=39&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349662" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349662" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7390580" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349662">Ludmila Prokunina-Olsson, Ph.D.</a>, in the Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG), DCEG as a postdoctoral fellow. He has been instrumental in establishing functional studies to explore the role of the newly discovered interferon lambda 4 (<em>IFNL4</em>) in cancer and infection. Dr. Onabajo has received the NCI Director&rsquo;s Career Development Award, the DCEG Fellows Award for Research Excellence, and the DCEG Fellowship Achievement Award. He also received an award from the International Cytokine and Interferon Society. He was promoted to staff scientist in LTG in 2016.</p>
<h2><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Onabajo&rsquo;s research interests are focused on understanding the biology of <em>IFNL4</em>, a novel interferon that was discovered by the Prokunina-Olsson group in LTG and collaborators in 2013. He is defining how <em>IFNL4</em> is associated with the pathogenesis of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, which is a leading cause of liver cancer. Dr. Onabajo showed that <em>IFNL4</em> has a strong anti-proliferative effect in a hepatoma cell line and is currently defining the mechanism of this effect. He is evaluating the anti-proliferative effect of <em>IFNL4</em> on other cancer cell lines, which may have translational potential. Dr. Onabajo also explores the association of <em>IFNL4</em> with cancers of viral origin as well as viral infections in general. For example, he is exploring the role of <em>IFNL4</em> in Burkitt lymphoma, a major pediatric cancer in Africa.</p>

<h3><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h3>
<p>Dr. Troisi received a Sc.D. from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1994 and joined NCI the same year.&nbsp;Her research has focused on the hormonal etiologies of reproductive cancers and the role of maternal, gestational, neonatal and early life factors in breast cancer risk, including endocrine disruptors such as diethylstilbestrol, a drug previously given to pregnant women. Dr. Troisi and colleagues Dr. Marlene Goldman and Dr. Kathryn Rexrode edited the second edition of <em>Women and Health</em>, a comprehensive review of the behavioral, social, and biological determinants of health and well-being in women, published in late 2012 by Elsevier. She received NIH Merit Awards in 2011 and 2012.</p>

<li>Hormonal etiologies of reproductive cancers</li>

<li>The biology of early life risk factors and implications for cancer risk</li>
</ul>
<h4>DES Follow-up Study</h4>
<p>Since 1992, Dr. Troisi, other NCI investigators, and collaborators from five field study centers have been actively following DES exposed and unexposed mothers, daughters and sons, and granddaughters for adverse health effects resulting from this exposure. As DES-exposed offspring are currently reaching the age when cancer rates begin to rise, it is important to continue to monitor long-term risk of cancer and other adverse health outcomes in this unique population. The study also provides a model for assessing a number of hypotheses that address concerns about prenatal hormonal influences on disease risk, both an intriguing area of science and an increasingly controversial environmental issue that affects a substantial proportion of the population.</p>
<p>To date the study has identified excess female breast cancer after age 40 that shows a dose-response effect, as well as increased risk for high-grade lesions of the cervix and vagina. Concern over other hormone-related cancers remains; though to date analyses have been limited due to small numbers of cases. In the sons, investigators observed an excess risk for urogenital anomalies and infertility, and a likely excess of testicular cancer. To examine the effects in the third generation (the daughters of the prenatally exposed daughters), investigators assembled a small cohort in 2000. Given their average age, there have been few relevant disease outcomes. However, investigators noted an elevated risk for infertility&mdash;though not statistically significant, this outcome was also seen in DES-daughters. In addition, there were three cases of ovarian cancer in the granddaughters, even though substantially less than one had been expected. While both of these observations remain difficult to interpret, they have added some urgency to expand the cohort and continue to follow-up. <a href="http://www.desfollowupstudy.org/index.asp">More on the DES Follow-up Study</a>.</p>

<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Kelly J. Yu received a B.S. in biology from the University of Maryland, College Park, an M.P.H. from Yale University, and a Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She focused her doctoral dissertation on evaluating early risk factors and prevention of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in high-risk families, and continued her postdoctoral work in the same area under the mentorship of Allan Hildesheim, Ph.D. In January 2011, she joined the Early Detection Research Group in the Division of Cancer Prevention as an epidemiologist and project officer for the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Screening Trial. She returned to DCEG/IIB in November 2015 as a staff scientist.</p>
<p>Dr. Yu has received several awards for her research, including the AACR Scholar-in-Training Award and NCI Award of Merit.</p>
<h2><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Yu&rsquo;s research has been focused primarily on screening as a mode of cancer prevention. Her interest is in evaluating the utility of the Epstein-Barr virus as a biomarker for early detection of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) in general and high-risk populations. To that end, she has maintained a long collaboration with researchers at the National Taiwan University and Academia Sinica, Taiwan, to evaluate the genetic and environmental risk factors of NPC. In addition, she is involved with a longitudinal study that aims to investigate the early natural history of head and neck cancer precursor lesions and evaluate the predictive ability of biomarkers for progression. This study is important because there are currently no consensus guidelines for follow-up and treatment of patients with precursor lesions. Successful completion of this study will provide critical information regarding 1) the most optimal screening intervals for follow-up of patients with precursor lesions and 2) the ideal way to identify patients for treatment.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Cahoon received her B.S.E. in bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania, her S.M. from the Engineering Systems Division at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and her M.H.S. in biostatistics and Ph.D. in epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. She joined the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) as a postdoctoral fellow in 2010 and was promoted to research fellow in 2014. She was appointed to the position of Earl Stadtman Tenure-Track Investigator in 2017. Dr. Cahoon has received numerous awards for her work, including the DCEG Intramural Research Award, the DCEG Outstanding Research Paper by a Fellow, and the NIH Award of Merit.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Cahoon&rsquo;s research focuses on cancer and precancer risks conferred by environmental sources of radiation exposure.</p>
<h3>Ultraviolet Radiation and Skin Cancer</h3>
<p>Solar radiation is the primary environmental risk factor for most types of skin cancers, which occur in 5 million people and result in more than ten thousand deaths each year in the United States. Sensitivity to sunlight is influenced by constitutional characteristics such as skin complexion and potentially external factors such as use of photosensitizing medications. Dr. Cahoon is working to identify medications that modify the relationship between UV radiation and skin cancer risk.</p>
<p>For skin cancer prevention, information on the timing of UV radiation exposure over the life course is important. In addition, despite a shift in our relative exposure to different UV radiation wavelengths due to use of sunscreens, tanning beds, and even window glass, the relative roles of UV radiation wavelengths and skin cancer risks are not known. Dr. Cahoon is evaluating the UV radiation dose-response relationship for skin cancer risk by wavelength, age at exposure, and anatomic site.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Cahoon is evaluating the role of UV radiation in viral activation, immune modulation, and other mediators of skin (and other) cancer risk. Her previous work identified a relationship between ambient UV radiation and risk of Kaposi sarcoma, possibly through reactivation of the causative virus, human herpesvirus 8. Dr. Cahoon is working to confirm these findings in independent populations.</p>
<h3>Ionizing Radiation</h3>
<p>Ionizing radiation exposure from occupational, accidental, and medical sources continues to be of public health significance and regulatory concern. Quantification of radiation-related risks provides important information for risk assessment models and risk/benefit analyses of cancer screening programs that rely on radiation for early cancer ascertainment. Dr. Cahoon examines radiation-related risk of various cancer types in the Lifespan Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors and is also leading a thyroid cancer case-control study nested in a cohort of Chernobyl liquidators (i.e., emergency clean-up workers) who were exposed to a large range of external radiation.</p>
Few studies have evaluated the relationship between I-131 exposure and thyroid nodules, which are potential precursors for thyroid cancer. Dr. Cahoon is examining incidence of new thyroid nodules in Belarus and Ukraine and progression of prevalent nodules. Potentially providing a rare window into multistage carcinogenesis, these will be the first studies to evaluate whether nodule characteristics associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer, such as size and vascularization, are apparent at clinical diagnosis or whether these characteristics emerge and evolve over time.</div>

<p>Dr. Hoskins earned his B.S. in biochemistry in 2002 and his Ph.D. in biochemistry in 2007, both from the University of Rochester, New York. His thesis work helped establish the RNA-based toxicity of the chemotherapeutic drug 5-fluorouracil, and proposed a model mechanism for these RNA-based effects in <em>Saccharomyces cerevisae</em>. Prior to joining NCI, Dr. Hoskins served as a postdoctoral fellow in the laboratory of Charles Thornton at the University of Rochester, studying candidate compounds for the treatment of myotonic dystrophy. <br /><br />Dr. Hoskins joined the Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG) as a postdoctoral fellow in 2011, and became a research fellow in 2014, under the mentorship of Laufey Amundadottir, Ph.D., senior investigator, LTG. In these roles, he identified a new putative pancreatic tumor suppressor gene (<em>HNF1A</em>), and developed a molecular model explaining the risk altering effects of a germline pancreatic cancer risk variant in a large gene desert on chr13q22.1. In 2017, Dr. Hoskins was appointed as a staff scientist in the LTG, where he continues his pancreatic cancer post-GWAS functional work with an interest in applying systems biology approaches to understanding the effects of risk altering alleles in the context of complex gene regulatory programs.</p>

<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Liu received his Ph.D. in biostatistics from the University of Washington in 2010, and completed a two-year postdoctoral training at the National Alzheimer&rsquo;s Coordinating Center, University of Washington. Prior to joining NCI, he served as a tenure-track investigator at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD). Dr. Liu joined the Biostatistics Branch of the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics in October 2017.</p>
<h2 id="research">Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Liu is interested in developing new statistical methods to evaluate and combine biomarkers for use in risk prediction. Individualized disease risk prediction is particularly attractive to patients, health care providers and policy makers. At the population level, accurate prediction of disease helps target interventions and treatments to the most vulnerable groups. Biomarker research has attracted much attention in the diagnosis or prediction of disease outcomes, especially in studies of cancer. Particularly, Dr. Liu is interested in the following topics.</p>
<h3>Developing methods to incorporate longitudinal biomarkers into risk prediction</h3>
<p>It is important to incorporate longitudinal biomarkers into risk prediction of clinical endpoints, because additional information on pathology and critical time window is contained in the subject-specific trajectories of the biomarkers. Prediction accuracy could be substantially improved by incorporating the longitudinal information. Dr. Liu has been working on methods for effectively combining longitudinal biomarkers in predicting disease outcomes. In cancer risk prediction, a unique challenge is to account for the timing of, and cancer staging at, diagnosis. Dr. Liu is interested in risk prediction under a survival model framework, where the staging at diagnosis can be used to estimate the lag between cancer onset and diagnosis. While properly accounting for the timing and staging information, Dr. Liu is developing statistical methods to make formal inference on how the risk prediction accuracy of a biomarker changes over time.</p>
<h3>Developing model selection techniques for combining high-dimensional longitudinal biomarkers</h3>
<p>Including more biomarkers into a prediction model does not always improve prediction accuracy. Selection of markers is a crucial step, especially when the number of candidate markers is large. Marker selection involves several aspects: selecting markers with high classification power, selecting the important time points for making observations, and selecting subgroups of patients for enhanced prediction. Dr. Liu is interested in developing model selection techniques for longitudinal risk prediction.</p>
<h3>Missing data problems in biomarker evaluation and combination</h3>
<p>Incomplete observations are common in most longitudinal studies, but this problem has not been studied in the context of biomarker combination. Both the biomarker and the outcome could be missing due to loss of follow-up. The absence might be informative if the dropout process depends on a subject&rsquo;s unobserved characteristics. For example, the subjects who develop cancer sooner have a shorter follow-up and hence fewer biomarker observations. Dr. Liu&rsquo;s interest lies in developing efficient and robust techniques to correct for the bias that results from ignoring the missing data.</p>

She is board certified in pediatrics and pediatric hematology-oncology.</p>
<h2><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Khincha&rsquo;s research interests lie in understanding inherited cancer predisposition syndromes, particularly those that can affect children.</p>
<h3>Dyskeratosis Congenita and Telomere Biology</h3>
<p>During her tenure as a clinical collaborator, Dr. Khincha worked with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=44&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349621" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349621" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7328568" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349621">Sharon A. Savage, M.D.</a>, Chief, CGB, focusing her research on the diagnostic methods and clinical management of dyskeratosis congenita (DC), a cancer-prone inherited bone marrow failure syndrome and telomere biology disorder (TBD). As clinical fellow, she continued this work, reporting on novel phenotypes and treatment of effects of DC, while developing expertise in the TBD spectrum and telomere measurement methods. Dr. Khincha is also embarking on a deep phenotyping and genotype-phenotype project in DC, and is currently working on collaborative international studies of a novel vascular phenotype in DC/TBDs within the Clinical Care Consortium for Telomere Associated Ailments.</p>
<h3>Li-Fraumeni Syndrome</h3>
<p>Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is a highly-penetrant autosomal dominant cancer predisposition syndrome associated with a wide range of cancer types that occur at younger-than-expected ages. The NCI&rsquo;s longitudinal study on the <a href="https://lfs.cancer.gov/">clinical, genetic, and epidemiologic study of LFS</a> opened in 2011 under the leadership of Dr. Savage, in order to further characterize the clinical and molecular consequences of this disorder, and develop a cancer screening program for <em>TP53</em> mutation carriers. The team also assisted in the creation of an international LFS research consortium. During her NCI tenure, Dr. Khincha has been involved with the LFS Study in clinical evaluations and genetics of LFS families, quickly building her expertise in this area, taking on leadership roles in the study, and collaborating with experts in the consortium. Her LFS research focusses on developing an effective cancer surveillance protocol for these families, genotype-phenotype analyses, understanding the genetics and biological basis for cancer development in LFS, and evaluating the effects of cancer treatment on subsequent cancer risks.</p>

<h2><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h2>
<p>Dr. Arash Etemadi received an M.D., an M.P.H., and a Ph.D. in epidemiology from Tehran University of Medical Sciences. As a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maastricht in the Netherlands, he worked on polymorphisms in the genes responsible for the metabolism of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and DNA repair. Dr. Etemadi was appointed as an Assistant Professor of Epidemiology at Tehran University of Medical Sciences, before joining DCEG as a postdoctoral visiting fellow in 2010. He was promoted to research fellow in 2015 and became a staff scientist in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB) in 2018.</p>
<p>Dr. Etemadi has been the recipient of multiple awards, including an Intramural Research Award, the DCEG Fellows Award for Research Excellence, the NCI Director&rsquo;s Career Development Innovation Award, the DCEG Fellowship Achievement Award, and the Outstanding Research Paper by a Fellow Award.</p>
<h2><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>As a molecular epidemiologist, Dr. Etemadi&rsquo;s main research focus is population-based studies on the molecular basis of etiology, early detection, and prevention of chronic diseases, especially cancer.</p>
<h4>Emerging exposures</h4>
<p>Dr. Etemadi is studying exposures to carcinogens from tobacco and non-tobacco sources in a number of studies and research collaborations. As part of these studies, he is working on health outcomes associated with alternative tobacco products (such as waterpipe or hookah, and smokeless tobacco), using questionnaires and biomarkers.</p>
<p>Another example is his evaluation of the effects of long-term opioid use. With the increasing number of people using opioids over extended periods of time, their long-term health effects pose important concerns. However, studying these health effects is particularly challenging because of the lack of longitudinal data, difficulties in following opioid users over extended periods of time, and the lack of information about the best way to characterize and measure long-term opioid use. Dr. Etemadi&rsquo;s research is using unique resources and collaborations to overcome these challenges.</p>
<h4>Upper gastrointestinal cancers</h4>
<p>Dr. Etemadi has a track record of studying upper gastrointestinal tract cancers (i.e. cancers of the esophagus and stomach). He is a member of the&nbsp;<a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/dceg-working-groups/ugcrg-upper-gastrointestinal-group">DCEG Upper Gastrointestinal (UGI) Cancer Research Group</a>. He is also a member of several large field studies of UGI cancers in high-incidence areas and helps coordinate MEB&rsquo;s broad portfolio of international field studies across Asia and Africa. In addition, Dr. Etemadi is an investigator in the <a href="https://dceg2.cancer.gov/gemshare/">GEMINI project</a> and the <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/members/gcs.html">Golestan Cohort Study</a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Mille received a B.S. in physics and mathematics from the University of Maryland, College Park, and a Ph.D. in nuclear engineering and science from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, with a focus in medical physics and radiation protection. Prior to joining the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), Dr. Mille served as a National Research Council postdoctoral associate (2014-2016) in the Radiation Physics Division of the National Institute of Standards and Technology, where he performed research related to quantitative medical imaging, radiation dosimetry, and radionuclide metrology. Dr. Mille joined the REB in 2016, starting as postdoctoral fellow in the Radiation Dosimetry Unit, where he performed radiation exposure assessment for branch studies. He was appointed as a staff scientist in May 2019.</p>
<h2><a id="Research-Interests"></a>Research Interests</h2>
<p>Dr. Mille&rsquo;s research interests center on computer simulations and metrology related to the delivery, detection, and dosimetry of ionizing radiation in medical imaging, radiation therapy, radiation protection, and homeland security. His research has touched on the need to optimize the radiation dose received by patients undergoing medical imaging exams or radiation treatment for cancer, as well as the need to detect and accurately quantify radioactivity inside the body resulting from planned nuclear medicine procedures or accidental contamination during a radiological emergency.</p>
<p>The key tools of his research are physical and computational human body phantoms, which are used in conjunction with experiment measurement and Monte Carlo radiation transport calculations. He supports radiation exposure assessment for several REB epidemiological studies looking at late health effects following radiotherapy, such as the National Wilms Tumor Study Cohort and the Kaiser Breast Cancer Survivors Cohort.</p>

<h3><a id="Biography"></a>Biography</h3>
<p>Margarita Aryavand received her B.S. in Nursing from George Mason University, followed by an M.S. in Nursing from Marymount University. She is a Board-Certified Family Nurse Practitioner and joined the NIH in 2001. She spent eleven years as a Nurse Practitioner with NCI's Medical Oncology Branch, working with individuals enrolled in clinical trials of new cancer treatments. At that time, she was a Clinical Trials Coordinator, and an Associate Investigator on numerous chemoprevention trials for solid and endocrine tumors. During her time at NIH she has also worked with minority populations with a focus on arthritis with the National Institute of Arthritis and Muscoloskeletal Skin Diseases and gained extensive knowledge on Renal Diseases with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. She joined the Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) in 2019, where she is currently involved in clinical and epidemiologic studies aimed at understanding familial cancer syndromes. She is a Commissioned Officer in the US Public Health Service and was promoted to Captain in 2017.</p>
<h3><a id="ResearchInterest"></a>Research Interests</h3>
<p>Current research interests include assessing the genetic causes and clinical features of RASopathies&mdash;a group of conditions caused by a genetic variation in the Ras pathway, which is key to cellular growth&mdash;and understanding the role of genetic and environmental factors in the etiology of cancer and related conditions. As CGB investigates the clinical implications of carrying mutations in cancer susceptibility genes and develops novel approaches to risk management, Ms. Aryavand&nbsp;hopes to learn which patients are at risk for cancer and other conditions and how family members may be impacted.</p>
