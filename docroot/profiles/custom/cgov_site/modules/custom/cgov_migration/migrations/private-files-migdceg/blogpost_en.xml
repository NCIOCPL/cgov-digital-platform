Findings from two complementary papers, a cohort mortality study and a nested case-control study of lung cancer, provide evidence that exposure to diesel exhaust may cause lung cancer in humans. This is the first report of a significant exposure-response relationship for <img alt="" class="left" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_contentid=352057&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="352057" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="2840897" sys_siteid="475" />diesel exposure and lung cancer based on quantitative estimates of historical diesel exposure with adjustment for smoking and other potential confounders. The collaborative effort between NCI and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) was led by <b>Debra T. Silverman, Sc.D.,</b> Chief of the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), and Dr. Michael Attfield, formerly of NIOSH.</p><h4>Why Study Diesel Exhaust?</h4><p>Researchers first raised the possibility that diesel exhaust might cause cancer in humans in 1955, after discovering components of diesel exhaust that were known to cause tumors in experimental animals. In 1989, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified diesel exhaust as a &#8220;probable&#8221; carcinogen based primarily on data from animal studies; data from humans were considered too limited to establish causality. Occupational exposure to diesel exhaust is common among certain groups, including miners, mechanics, transportation workers, and other operators of diesel-powered equipment. Exposure is not limited to workers, however; diesel exhaust is ubiquitous in cities, and people who live near highways, ports, and rail yards may have considerable exposure to diesel exhaust throughout their lives.</p><p>Since the 1980s, more than 35 studies have examined the relationship between lung cancer risk and diesel exhaust. Although most of these studies suggested a modest association between diesel exhaust exposure and lung cancer, few quantified exposure levels or adjusted for smoking in their analyses. These limitations of previous studies led Dr. Silverman and her colleagues to conclude that a need existed for further research on the carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust.</p><p>&#8220;It was vitally important to undertake a large study of diesel exhaust and lung cancer based on a quantitative assessment of historical exposure, taking into account smoking and other potentially relevant factors in order to estimate lung cancer risk,&#8221; Dr. Silverman said.</p><h4>A Landmark Study</h4><p>The Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study included four components: (1) an exposure monitoring study conducted from 1998 to 2001 (led by NIOSH), (2) a retrospective exposure assessment (led by NCI), (3) a retrospective cohort mortality study of 12,315 workers at eight non-metal mines (led by NIOSH), and (4) a nested case-control study of lung cancer deaths in the cohort (led by NCI). The researchers chose to investigate exposure to diesel exhaust in underground mines because high levels of diesel exhaust from heavy equipment build up in the enclosed underground mining environment. Non-metal mines (i.e., mines that produce limestone, potash, salt, and trona) were selected to avoid confounding exposures to other potential carcinogens, such as radon.</p><p><img alt="" class="left" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_contentid=351057&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="351057" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="2840894" sys_siteid="475" />The researchers characterized current and historical exposures to diesel exhaust, represented by respirable elemental carbon, and estimated personal exposures for each worker in the cohort. They based their estimates on thousands of measurements from exposure surveys at each mining facility, past Mine Safety and Health Administration enforcement surveys, and information from company records and interviews with long-term workers. In addition, the researchers reviewed records of inventories of working diesel equipment at each mine and ventilation data over time. The exposure assessment process is described in five papers published in the <i>Annals of Occupational Hygiene</i> (October 2010 and March 2012).</p><p>In the case-control study, the researchers interviewed subjects or next of kin about smoking behavior and other lung cancer risk factors, such as employment in other high-risk occupations and history of nonmalignant respiratory disease. Several DCEG scientists assisted with the case-control study. <b>Jay H. Lubin, Ph.D.,</b> senior investigator (now retired) in the Biostatistics Branch (BB), conducted the continuous modeling of exposure data; <b>Nathaniel Rothman, M.D., M.P.H., M.H.S.,</b> senior investigator in OEEB, collaborated on the analysis and mechanistic interpretations of the smoking-diesel interaction; <b>CDR Claudine M. Samanic, Ph.D.</b> (OEEB), assisted with the data collection and conduct of the study; and <b>Sholom Wacholder, Ph.D.,</b> senior investigator in BB, contributed to the case-control design and analysis. In addition, <b>Aaron E. Blair, Ph.D., M.P.H.,</b> a scientist emeritus of OEEB, offered general study guidance.</p><h4>Diesel Exhaust and Lung Cancer</h4><p>The cohort study, under the direction of Dr. Attfield, found that the risk of lung cancer among heavily exposed underground workers was five times the risk among workers in the lowest exposure category.</p><p>The case-control study, which was led by Dr. Silverman, confirmed the lung cancer findings from the cohort study and had the added strength of smoking histories. After taking smoking and other risk factors into account, the researchers found a threefold risk of lung cancer overall and about a fivefold risk among heavily exposed underground workers. The researchers estimated risk for several exposure metrics, with cumulative diesel exhaust exposure lagged 15 years yielding the strongest gradient in lung cancer risk.</p><p>For never smokers and light-to-moderate smokers, the risk of lung cancer death increased with more diesel exhaust exposure. Non-smokers with the highest level of diesel exposure were seven times more likely to die from lung cancer than non-smokers in the lowest exposure category. In contrast, among miners who were heavy smokers, the risk of lung cancer death decreased with increasing levels of exposure.</p><p>&#8220;Little is known about the interaction of smoking with diesel exhaust,&#8221; Dr. Silverman said. &#8220;The qualitative interaction we observed has not been reported previously and will require replication.&#8221;</p><p>The researchers offered possible explanations for the tapering off of risk at high levels of diesel exhaust exposure. Heavy smokers might be more likely to clear diesel exhaust particulate matter from their lungs than non-smokers, a phenomenon that has been reported previously among coal miners who smoke. Carcinogens in diesel exhaust and cigarette smoke also might operate along the same metabolic pathway in the body, competing with each other and saturating the pathway and, thus, diminishing the effects of both components.</p><h4>Study Challenges and Impact</h4><p>The Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study has been described as groundbreaking&#8212;not only because of its contribution to science but also because of the scientific and other challenges that the researchers overcame during the 20-year study period. For example, the careful exposure assessment and sophisticated methods development took years. &#8220;This study represents an enormous team effort,&#8221; Dr. Silverman said. &#8220;Many people provided invaluable input during the different stages of the study.&#8221;</p><p>From the very beginning, the study had high visibility because of its potential impact on regulatory policy, which led to significant legal and political challenges. As early as the mid-1990s, the researchers faced delays resulting from lawsuits from a coalition of companies representing mining industry interests.</p><p>&#8220;Despite the many challenges throughout the duration of this study, I&#8217;m proud to say that we persevered and finally published our findings,&#8221; Dr. Silverman said.</p><p>Although the researchers studied miners with very high levels of exposure to diesel exhaust, the results may be applicable to other workers with similar levels of diesel exposure and may extend to people living in urban areas with high diesel exhaust levels. Environmental exposures to average respirable elemental carbon levels in the range of 2 to 6 &#956;g/m3 over a lifetime, as is typical in some highly polluted cities, are similar to the cumulative exposures experienced by the underground miners with the lowest exposures in the study. Even underground workers with low exposure levels experienced about a 50 percent increase in lung cancer risk.</p><p>The publication of the study results was timely because it preceded reviews by IARC and the NIH National Toxicology Program to reassess the health risks associated with diesel exhaust exposure. In June, IARC announced that it had reclassified diesel exhaust as a Group 1 human carcinogen, a category that IARC uses when sufficient evidence is available indicating that a substance is carcinogenic to humans. The NIH National Toxicology Program will hold a review of diesel exhaust later in 2012.</p><h5><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1426&amp;sys_revision=5&amp;sys_contentid=350825&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="350825" sys_dependentvariantid="1426" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="2840898" sys_siteid="475">Back to the July 2012 issue of <i>Linkage</i>&#160;</a></h5></div>]]></body>

Today, DCEG&#8217;s research portfolio on cancer among immunocompromised patients involves two distinct, yet related, study populations: (1) organ transplant recipients and (2) HIV-infected individuals and persons with AIDS. Organ transplants have increased in recent decades for certain organ types (see Figure 1), and recipients must take immunosuppressive drugs for the remainder of their lives to prevent organ rejection. Both groups provide valuable populations in which to study the interconnected roles of infections, environmental exposures, inflammation, and the immune response in the development of cancer. DCEG senior investigator <b>Eric A. Engels, M.D., M.P.H.</b> (IIB), leads the Transplant Cancer Match (TCM) Study and the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match (HACM) Study, two large and complementary registry linkage studies on cancer among immunosuppressed populations.</p><p style=" text-align: center;"><img alt="" inlinetype="rximage" longdesc="/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2012-07/research-publications/fig1" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=5&amp;sys_contentid=351058&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="351058" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3159771" sys_siteid="475" /></p><h4>Transplant-related Immunosuppression and Cancer</h4><p>More than five years ago, Dr. Engels met with officials from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), the Department of Health and Human Services agency that oversees the U.S. organ transplant program, to discuss the creation of a resource linking the U.S. transplant registry with multiple cancer registries. &#8220;It was an exciting opportunity to take an unprecedented look at the cancer burden among solid organ transplant recipients,&#8221; Dr. Engels noted, &#8220;but it was also daunting because of the logistics involved in getting all the approvals from the cancer registries.&#8221; It took six years to get the study off the ground, but the efforts were well worth the time. The TCM Study now combines data from HRSA&#8217;s Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network and 15 population-based state or regional cancer registries, making it the largest study of its kind.</p><p>Dr. Engels and other TCM Study researchers published the study&#8217;s first article, which provides the most comprehensive description to date of the cancer burden among solid organ transplant recipients, in the November 2011 issue of the <i>Journal of the American Medical Association</i>. The authors assessed linked registry data from 175,732 solid organ transplant recipients, who represented roughly 40 percent of the U.S. transplant recipient population between 1987 and 2008, and measured the risk of individual cancer types among recipients of all types of organs. The researchers found a twofold increased risk of cancer among transplant recipients. This finding confirmed results from earlier, smaller studies, but the large size of the TCM Study also allowed the investigators to evaluate the risk of rare cancer types.</p><p>&#8220;We were surprised to find that this population is at increased risk for a large number of different cancers&#8212;32 different types of cancer, including some that we don&#8217;t commonly associate with HIV and immunosuppression,&#8221; Dr. Engels noted. For example, the four most common cancers among transplant recipients and that occur more commonly in these individuals than in the general population were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and cancers of the lung, kidney, and liver. NHL also is common among HIV-infected individuals and is associated with immunosuppression and Epstein-Barr virus, whereas liver cancer is associated with hepatitis B and C. However, researchers do not generally believe that lung and kidney cancers are associated with infection.</p><p>Having such a large, valuable resource as the TCM Study also permits swift follow-up studies on interesting leads. For example, <b>Todd M. Gibson, Ph.D.,</b> a postdoctoral fellow, and <b>Lindsay M. Morton, Ph.D.,</b> an investigator, both in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch, conducted an analysis of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, a common and highly aggressive form of NHL. They observed an almost 14-fold elevation in the risk of this NHL subtype among transplant recipients compared with the general population. Dr. Gibson recently presented the findings of this study at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research.</p><p>Dr. Engels and his team plan to pursue these leads in order to characterize the proportion of cancers related to infection and impaired immune response as well as to shed light on other possible mechanisms, especially for cancers not linked to infection.&#160;</p><h4>HIV and Cancer</h4><p>DCEG&#8217;s HACM Study is an example of a unique resource that has permitted the examination of cancer trends among the HIV and AIDS population over time. <b>James J. Goedert, M.D.</b> (IIB), and Dr. Robert Biggar (formerly of DCEG) initiated the HACM Study in 1990. The study now links data from 14 state and metropolitan HIV/AIDS registries across the United States with corresponding cancer registries. DCEG researchers have been able to show how AIDS-related cancer trends in the United States have changed since the HIV epidemic began, including the impact of the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy in 1996, through the mid-2000s.&#160;Over this time, individuals with HIV have experienced dramatic improvements <img alt="" class="left" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_contentid=351059&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="351059" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3159769" sys_siteid="475" />in survival and are now reaching ages when cancer is commonly diagnosed. The population of U.S. residents living with HIV quadrupled between 1991 and 2005, and the average age of this group has risen substantially. Recent DCEG work is focusing on the long-term effects of chronic HIV infection and the ways in which cancer affects individuals with HIV as they age.</p><p><b>Meredith Shiels, Ph.D.,</b> a research fellow in IIB, recently described the new landscape of cancer risk and burden among the HIV-infected population in the United States (Journal of the National Cancer Institute, May 2011, see Figure 2). Based on an analysis of data from the HACM Study, she showed that the number of AIDS-defining cancers (Kaposi sarcoma, NHL, and cervical cancer) has declined threefold (from 34,580 to 10,320 cases), while the number of other non&#8211;AIDS-defining cancers has tripled (from 3,200 to 10,000 cases). &#8220;We know that some of the more common non&#8211;AIDS-defining cancers diagnosed in this population are due to viral co-infection, such as hepatitis B or C viruses or human papillomavirus, or are related to smoking, which is much more common among the HIV/AIDS population than the general U.S. population,&#8221; said Dr. Shiels. &#8220;The results underscore the magnitude of the cancer burden that will continue to rise as this population ages and the need for surveillance and screening grows.&#8221;</p><p style=" text-align: center;"><img alt="" inlinetype="rximage" longdesc="/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2012-07/research-publications/fig2" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_contentid=351060&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="351060" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3159772" sys_siteid="475" /></p><p>To define these trends further, Drs. Engels and Shiels are working with <b>Ruth M. Pfeiffer, Ph.D.,</b> Biostatistics Branch, and other scientists to take a closer look at how HIV has influenced overall cancer rates in the general population. They recently estimated that 28 percent of anal cancer cases in men and 1 percent of cases in women in the United States between 2001 and 2005 occurred among the HIV-infected population. Anal cancer is rare in the United States, but its rates have been rising steadily for several decades. The large size of the HACM Study allowed investigators to estimate general population incidence rates with and without HIV-infected cases and to show for the first time that the rates of anal cancer over time in men have been influenced substantially by HIV-infected cases.</p><p>Examining cancer trends in large registry-based resources has been critical for understanding cancer risk in immunosuppressed populations in the United States, Dr. Engels stated. &#8220;There&#8217;s still a lot we&#8217;re trying to learn about what&#8217;s driving the increased risk for certain cancers, and hopefully we can identify mechanisms so that the cancer risks in these populations can be minimized.&#8221;</p></div>]]></body>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>Tenure-track investigator <b>Kevin Brown, Ph.D.,</b> Laboratory of Translational Genomics, has added a new chapter to DCEG&rsquo;s history of discovering the genetic factors that contribute to the risk of melanoma. As reported in a recent <i>Nature</i> article, Dr. Brown and colleagues used whole-genome sequencing to identify a novel, recurrent mutation, the E318K variant, in <i>MITF</i>. <i>MITF</i> is a gene that predisposes people to familial and sporadic melanoma (see <a href="#Figure 1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<p>The <i>MITF</i> gene, or microphthalmia-associated transcription factor, helps control the development and function of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. <i>MITF</i> has been considered an important gene in melanoma tumors for many years, being somatically amplified or mutated in some subsets of melanoma while strongly overexpressed in others.</p>
<p><a id="Figure 1"></a><img class="center" alt="" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=386454" longdesc="/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2012-03/research-publications/03122" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" sys_dependentid="386454" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="6425346" sys_siteid="475" /></p>
<p>Dr. Brown&rsquo;s paper describes the latest in a series of major DCEG findings on the genetics of melanoma. The ultimate goal of this research is the prevention and early detection of melanoma in high-risk individuals. The application of novel research approaches has been enabled by the large body of clinical and epidemiological data, as well as biospecimens, that have been collected over years of family and case-control studies.</p>
<h4>A History of Genetic Detective Work</h4>
<p>DCEG first began investigating possible genetic linkages to melanoma during the late 1970s under the leadership of <b>Mark H. Greene, M.D.,</b> now Chief of the Clinical Genetics Branch. <b>Margaret A. Tucker, M.D.,</b> Director of DCEG&rsquo;s Human Genetics Program, was a postdoctoral fellow working with Dr. Greene at the time of the initial investigation, and she later led and expanded the effort in melanoma research. Over time, the Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) evaluated and prospectively followed approximately 80 multigenerational families with more than 1,800 members, some for up to 30 years. The investigators gathered detailed family histories, performed clinical examinations, and phenotyped the families. The goal was to identify high-risk susceptibility genes for melanoma, understand the risk factors for sporadic and familial cases, and provide better guidance for screening and clinical practice.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="left" alt="" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=386663" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" sys_dependentid="386663" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="6425347" sys_siteid="475" />One of the first major clinical findings in these families was the identification and characterization of dysplastic nevi, the unusual moles seen in melanoma families. In a large case-control study, Dr. Tucker later showed that dysplastic nevi are precursors to both familial and sporadic melanoma, a finding that has had a significant impact on clinical screening protocols.</p>
<p><b>Gathering the Pieces of the Melanoma Puzzle</b></p>
<p>The first linkage analysis of familial melanoma, based on 23 genetic markers, was conducted in 1983 by <b>Lynn R. Goldin, Ph.D.,</b> now Deputy Chief of GEB, who found suggestive evidence of linkage on the short arm of chromosome 1. In 1994, <b>Alisa M. Goldstein, Ph.D.</b> (GEB), and Dr. Tucker identified the first melanoma susceptibility gene&mdash;<i>CDKN2A</i>, a tumor suppressor gene found in roughly 40 percent of melanoma-prone families. <i>CDKN2A</i> codes for p16 and p14 proteins and also has been found to be associated with pancreatic cancer, although the precise mechanism underlying that association has yet to be understood. The two researchers identified a second melanoma susceptibility gene in 1996&mdash;<i>CDK4</i>, which encodes cyclin-dependent kinase 4, an oncogene, and accounts for approximately 2 percent of melanoma-prone families. Dr. Goldstein also demonstrated that another gene, <i>MC1R</i>, is a modifier of melanoma risk in American families with <i>CDKN2A</i> mutations. Individuals with <i>MC1R</i> variants are more likely to have multiple melanomas that start at an earlier age.</p>
<p>Further studies were performed through GenoMEL (the Melanoma Genetics Consortium), which was established in 1997 with initial funding through NCI and is composed of researchers from approximately 20 countries. The creation of GenoMEL provided a larger number of familial melanoma patients in whom mutations in the high-risk melanoma genes could be studied and better characterized. Dr. Goldstein has led multiple analyses within GenoMEL, including a study that identified differences in the risk of melanoma and other tumors associated with mutations in <i>CDKN2A</i> across geographic locales. That study also detected a strong association between pancreatic cancer and <i>CDKN2A</i> mutations.</p>
<p>In 2006, <b>Maria Teresa Landi, M.D., Ph.D.</b> (GEB), reported on data from case-control studies in Italy and San Francisco showing that Caucasians with a germline variant of <i>MC1R</i>, the gene encoding the melanocortin-1 receptor, were more likely to develop melanoma with <i>BRAF</i> mutations. Following up on her finding by examining the association in a much larger number of subjects in GenoMEL, Dr. Landi and colleagues found three areas of significant association with melanoma: on 16q24 marking <i>MC1R</i>, on 11q12-q14 near <i>TYR</i>, and on 9p21 near <i>MTAP</i>. In subsequent larger studies, four more loci have been identified, in <i>ATM</i>, <i>MX2</i>, and <i>CASP8</i>, as well as on 1q21.3.</p>
<p>Along with <b>Ruth A. Kleinerman, M.P.H.,</b> of the Radiation Epidemiology Branch, Dr. Tucker and colleagues found that patients with inherited retinoblastoma, a rare cancer of the eye that tends to develop in early childhood, had a significantly higher risk of developing melanoma and that a family history of retinoblastoma further increased their risk. This work suggests that the tumor suppressor gene <i>RB</i> may play a role in melanoma as well as retinoblastoma.</p>
<h4>Harnessing New Technology</h4>
<p>In more recent years, investigators have harnessed next-generation DNA sequencing technology to make critical discoveries. For example, exome sequencing has become a common means of interrogating the protein-coding regions of a genome at a relatively low cost. Other new techniques include high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH), which detects genomic copy number variations, or alterations of the DNA of a genome that result in an abnormal number of copies of a section of DNA; chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing, which is used to analyze protein interactions with DNA; and molecular profiling, which provides a powerful means of classifying tumors based on their underlying biology.</p>
<p><b>Xiaohong Rose Yang, Ph.D., M.P.H.</b> (GEB), is employing these new techniques in her search for genetic variation and regulation of genes linked to melanoma susceptibility within the American families. In collaboration with Dr. Meg Gerstenblith of the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine in Cleveland, Ohio, Dr. Yang is launching a study that will identify clinically and etiologically relevant subtypes of melanoma using integrated molecular profiling approaches. She and other scientists are assessing the feasibility of conducting molecular profiling analyses on DNA and RNA extracted from melanoma tissue blocks. &ldquo;With improved awareness and earlier diagnoses, most melanoma tumors diagnosed in the U.S. are small,&rdquo; said Dr. Tucker. &ldquo;With this pilot study, we will assess whether enough tumor material is available in routinely collected pathology tissue blocks for the molecular analyses.&rdquo;</p>
<h4>Translating Research Into Clinical Practice</h4>
<p>The DCEG melanoma research program has always had a strong translational clinical component. Following melanoma-prone families over the long term has enabled investigators to develop recommendations for managing risk factors and has changed clinical practice for screening. Mary Fraser, a former clinical research nurse in GEB, spent considerable time educating members of melanoma-prone families on ways to reduce their risk of the disease and how to recognize dysplastic nevi and other warning signs of early-stage melanoma. GEB also developed a tool to measure exposure to the sun based on lifetime history of residence, and developed a risk prediction model that can be used by primary care providers to plan for screening of individuals not in melanoma-prone families. In addition, to inform study participants, clinicians, and the public, DCEG has published a melanoma atlas, videos, newsletters, and brochures, including a recent award-winning brochure targeting populations of color and their physicians titled <i>Anyone Can Get Skin Cancer</i> (see the July 2011 issue of Linkage).</p>
<p>Thanks to the long-term investment in these resources, DCEG investigators are poised to apply novel technologies and approaches that will help unlock the complexities of melanoma genetics, including gene-environment interactions, and to translate the findings to facilitate the prevention, early detection, and treatment of this disease.</p>

<p>In epidemiology, what can be learned from eight cases of an extremely rare tumor observed in the same clinic? Quite a lot, in fact, thanks to an inquisitive mother who asked whether her daughter’s tumor was caused by “the medicine” the mother took during pregnancy and to the astute physicians who decided to follow up on her question.</p>

<p>The medicine that the mother referred to was diethylstilbestrol, or DES, a synthetic estrogen manufactured and marketed as a drug that would prevent miscarriage and other complications of pregnancy. DES became clinically available in the United States during the early 1940s and, for the next 30 years, was prescribed to millions of pregnant women. By the late 1950s, a series of clinical trials had been published that showed no efficacy in preventing the adverse events that DES was supposed to keep from occurring. Nonetheless, the drug continued to be prescribed.</p>

<p>Then, in 1971, Dr. Arthur Herbst, Dr. Howard Ulfelder, and Dr. David Poskanzer published their report of eight clear cell adenocarcinomas (CCA) of the vagina and cervix among young women (aged 14 to 22 years old) in a clinic in Boston and their documented prior exposure to DES. The researchers’ findings were noteworthy because CCA is extremely rare and is usually found in much older women. The seminal paper established the association between <i>in utero</i> exposure to DES and a woman’s increased risk of cancer. The paper also prompted the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to issue a warning to physicians that the drug should not be prescribed to pregnant women.</p>

<p><img alt="" class="left" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=386664&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="386664" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="5978788" sys_siteid="475" />Various clinics across the country initiated clinical and follow-up studies of the effects of DES in females and males exposed to the drug <i>in utero</i>. However, according to <b>Robert N. Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.,</b> Director of DCEG’s Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program (EBP), “Over time, enthusiasm and funding for these efforts progressively waned, so that by the late 1980s, most of the follow-up work had stopped.”</p>

<p>Recognizing the need to continue observing DES-exposed mothers and their offspring, Dr. Hoover reached out to several principal investigators at the various study centers and suggested reviving the cohorts and pooling the data to better answer the many questions that remained. Having the larger cohort would allow sufficient statistical power to find associations for rarer outcomes that otherwise would be missed in the individual cohorts.</p>

<p>In 1992, a combined cohort was assembled and named the “DES Follow-up Study.” It included DES-exposed and non–DES-exposed mothers and their offspring from cohorts that had been enrolled during the 1970s along with clinical and other information from that era. The combined study pooled 5,067 daughters exposed to DES <i>in utero</i> and 2,387 non-exposed females. It also included 2,001 DES-exposed sons and 2,111 non-exposed males. Among the mothers, 5,441 were exposed to DES during pregnancy and 4,036 were not exposed, making it the largest follow-up study of DES in the country. Dr. Hoover and <b>Rebecca Troisi, Sc.D.,</b> a staff scientist in EBP, have been DCEG’s coprincipal investigators of the study.</p>

<p>Subjects were re-contacted and invited to participate in the combined cohort by completing the 1994 baseline questionnaire and subsequent periodic questionnaires. Since that time, numerous key findings have emerged. “DES is an endocrine-disrupting chemical,” Dr. Troisi stated. “From the many laboratory studies that have been done, we know these types of chemicals can cause cancer, birth defects, and other developmental abnormalities in the reproductive tract, and the effects of exposure are most severe when it occurs during fetal development.” The study team explored these leads and confirmed that effects of DES were evident not only in DES-exposed mothers but also in both daughters and sons exposed to the drug <i>in utero</i>.</p>

<p>In 2001, the study team found that mothers who had been prescribed DES during pregnancy had a 20 to 30 percent increased risk of breast cancer than non–DES-exposed women in the same age group. A 2009 study of DES-exposed sons found that risks for cryptorchidism, epididymal cyst, and testicular inflammation or infection were twice those of non–DES-exposed males and were three times as great among sons exposed to DES before the 11th week of gestation. The sons’ abnormalities, however, had no overall adverse effect on their fertility or reproductive outcomes.</p>

<p>Using data from the 1994, 1997, and 2001 follow-up questionnaires, the study team, led by Dr. Hoover, published an article in the October 6, 2011, issue of the <i>New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM)</i> that included the most comprehensive analysis of data on women exposed to DES while <i>in utero</i>, illustrating the cumulative effects of this exposure over the course of a woman’s lifetime. Among 4,653 DES-exposed and 1,927 non–DES-exposed women, the authors evaluated 12 adverse health and reproductive outcomes—infertility, spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, loss of second trimester pregnancy, preterm delivery, preeclampsia, stillbirth, neonatal death, early menopause, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade 2+, breast cancer, and CCA—all of which had been linked previously to DES exposure in preliminary reports from the combined study (see Table 1).</p>

<p>Compared with non–DES-exposed women, women exposed to DES <i>in utero</i> had eight times the risk of neonatal death, almost five times the risk for preterm delivery, and nearly four times the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy. In addition, DES-exposed daughters were twice as likely to experience infertility. Risks of breast cancer or neoplastic cervical lesions were approximately doubled and persisted until age 55. Finally, the data showed that the 40-fold increased risk of CCA, the cancer diagnosed in young women exposed to DES <i>in utero</i>, remained elevated until at least age 40.</p>

<p>The 2011 paper by Dr. Hoover and colleagues also was the first to assess possible dose-response effects between the amount of DES exposure <i>in utero</i> and the risk of all outcomes by using a unique marker called vaginal epithelial changes (VEC), a phenomenon observed particularly in women exposed to high doses of DES early in gestation. These changes appear as red granular patches in the epithelium of the vagina and represent a precursor to CCA. According to the report in <i>NEJM</i>, women with VEC experienced even higher risks for 9 of the 12 outcomes evaluated than DES-exposed women without VEC.&#160;</p>

<p><img alt="" class="right" inlinetype="rximage" longdesc="/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2012-03/research-publications/03121" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=393793&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="393793" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="5978789" sys_siteid="475" /></p>

<p>Findings from the studies of DES-exposed women have provided the impetus and the laboratory model for the current widespread interest in the biologic impact of endocrine disruptors, particularly from fetal and other early-life exposures. “The DES story has many valuable lessons for clinical medicine, in particular for an entire generation of clinicians who, for the most part, have been unaware of this signal event in medical history,” Dr. Hoover noted. These lessons include the value of clinical trials; the special vulnerability of the fetus; the importance of being alert to unusual events and searching for possible causes; and, perhaps most important, the need for systematic long-term surveillance for adverse outcomes of drug exposures. Dr. Hoover further added, “It is clear that without the startling occurrence of a cluster of a rare cancer in adolescent girls, we would be unaware of the massive burden of multiple common adverse health outcomes ultimately endured by DES-exposed women.”</p>

<p>The DES Follow-up Study will continue to follow DES-exposed daughters as they move into the menopausal years and beyond (i.e., the ages when cancers more commonly occur) as well as follow DES-exposed sons. In addition, the study recently has expanded to include granddaughters of DES-exposed and non–DES-exposed women, referred to as the “third generation.” Because of the relatively young age of the research participants, these studies will focus on exploring the basis for biological persistence of DES effects across generations.</p>

Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.,</b> reached a career milestone of 50 years at NCI. He marked this anniversary by stepping down as Director of DCEG, while continuing to serve as a senior investigator and advisor at NCI and NIH.</p><p>&#8220;Throughout his 50 years at NIH, Dr. Fraumeni has distinguished himself by his creative and diligent pursuit of the causes of cancer, both genetic and environmental. He has been universally recognized for his intellectual contributions to&#8212;and inspired leadership of&#8212;the field of cancer epidemiology,&#8221; said NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. &#8220;Furthermore, he has almost single-handedly built the remarkable, even enviable, epidemiology division at NCI, an intramural program in which scientists continue to study the origins of cancer with tools that range from the population to the molecular level.&#8221;</p><p>Dr. Fraumeni received an undergraduate degree from Harvard College, an M.D. from Duke University, and an M.Sc. in epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health. After completing a medical residency at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, he joined NIH in 1962 as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS). After a progression of leadership positions at NCI, Dr. Fraumeni became founding Director of DCEG in 1995, at which time he was promoted in the PHS to the rank of Rear Admiral and Assistant Surgeon General.</p><p>Throughout his years of leadership at NIH, Dr. Fraumeni shaped and directed a comprehensive epidemiological and interdisciplinary research program designed to identify the environmental and genetic determinants of cancer and the means of prevention. A continuing focus of his personal research has been the study of genetic susceptibility to cancer, particularly by investigating familial aggregations of various cancers. Most notable was his discovery in 1969 with fellow NCI researcher Dr. Frederick P. Li of a rare, inherited syndrome manifested by a striking constellation of multiple cancers in children and young adults. This observation eventually led to collaborative molecular studies that uncovered inherited mutations in the <i>p53</i> tumor suppressor gene.</p><p><img alt="" class="right" height="241" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=3&amp;sys_contentid=519482&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="519482" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410742" sys_siteid="475" width="256" />Another central theme of Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s research has been the search for lifestyle and other environmental causes of cancer. In 1975, he led the development of the first in a series of computer-generated maps depicting geographical variation of U.S. cancer mortality at the county level. This work allowed Dr. Fraumeni and his colleagues to develop a way to identify the environmental exposures driving the distinctive patterns of certain malignancies and also to target high-risk areas for measures aimed at cancer prevention and control.</p><p>Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s recent work has centered on the integration of genomic and other emerging technologies in efforts to dissect the genetic and environmental components of cancer and their interactive effects in the origins and progression of cancer. Toward this end, Dr. Fraumeni has been a leader in developing molecular epidemiology platforms and large-scale collaborative strategies to accelerate a fuller understanding of carcinogenic risks and mechanisms that will inform new clinical and public health interventions.</p><p><img alt="" class="left" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=505584&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="505584" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410740" sys_siteid="475" />In recognition of his scientific achievements, Dr. Fraumeni has received numerous honors, including the Charles S. Mott Prize from the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation, the Abraham Lilienfeld Award from the American College of Epidemiology, the John Snow Award from the American Public Health Association, the James D. Bruce Award from the American College of Physicians, the Nathan Davis Award from the American Medical Association, the Alton Ochsner Award from the American College of Chest Physicians, the Medal of Honor from the American Cancer Society, and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Association for Cancer Research. In addition, Dr. Fraumeni has been elected to membership in the National Academy of Sciences, the Institute of Medicine, the Association of American Physicians, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.</p><p>Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s research contributions are documented in more than 860 scientific publications and books, including several editions of the definitive textbook <i>Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention</i>, which he co-edited with Dr. David Schottenfeld of the University of Michigan.&#160;</p><p>As an extension of his strong commitment to mentoring, Dr. Fraumeni has provided the vision to create a renowned fellowship program at NCI designed to train the next generation of scientific leaders in epidemiology, genetics, statistics, and related fields. This legacy continues through efforts of the current leadership of the Division and its Office of Education.</p><p>&#8220;The last 50 years have seen the discipline of cancer epidemiology come of age, providing the foundation for cancer prevention and control,&#8221; said Dr. Christopher P. Wild, Director of the International Agency for Research on Cancer. &#8220;Dr. Fraumeni has been one of the leading contributors throughout, both because of his own innovative research and through the productive environment he has created at NCI. His view of cancer is a global one. In this context, he has been a wonderful supporter and collaborator for scientists at our international agency and for so many others in countries around the world.&#8221;</p><p><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1426&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_contentid=502987&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="502987" sys_dependentvariantid="1426" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410743" sys_siteid="475">Back to the December 2012 issue of <i>Linkage</i></a></p></div>]]></body>

Such an evaluation reflects the investigator&#8217;s demonstration of leadership in the field; the mentoring and training of junior scientists; and the development of resources, technologies, and methodologies that galvanize research by other scientists. Several indices have been developed as benchmarks to estimate the overall impact of a scientist&#8217;s work. The two most commonly used are the Thomson Reuters Web of Knowledge Science Citation Index (SCI) and the <i>h</i>-index. The SCI indicates the number of articles that have cited a given publication, whereas the <i>h</i>-index estimates a scientist&#8217;s cumulative contribution by expressing the number of articles (<i>h</i>) that have received at least <i>h</i> citations. By any of these measures, the contributions of <b>Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.,</b> are remarkable.</p><p>Based on an analysis conducted in August 2012, Dr. Fraumeni had more than 860 publications with more than 60,000 citations in the Web of Knowledge database; he also had an almost unheard of <i>h</i>-index of 121. Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s top-cited publications include articles on Li-Fraumeni syndrome and the Wilms tumor-aniridia syndrome; the racial and geographic variation of cancer in the United States and internationally; the rising incidence of several cancers, including adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, gastric cardia, and kidney; studies of cancer risk among various immunosuppressed populations, including organ transplant recipients; the role of smokeless tobacco and alcohol in oral and pharyngeal cancer; the relationship between herbicide exposures and non-Hodgkin lymphoma; the impact of nutritional and antibiotic interventions on esophageal and gastric cancer in high-risk populations in China; the role of indoor air pollution in the high rates of lung cancer in China; and genome-wide association studies of breast, prostate, and several other cancers. <a href="#Fig1">Figure 1</a>, showing the annual number of citations of publications that Dr. Fraumeni has written, demonstrates that his scientific impact shows no signs of waning.</p><p><a id="Fig1">&#160;</a></p><p><img alt="" class="center" inlinetype="rximage" longdesc="/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2012-12/research-publications/impact-fig1-longdesc" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=505604&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="505604" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410752" sys_siteid="475" /></p><p><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1426&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_contentid=502987&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="502987" sys_dependentvariantid="1426" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410753" sys_siteid="475">Back to the December 2012 issue of <i>Linkage</i></a></p></div>]]></body>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>In the 1960s, <b>Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.,</b> and Dr. Robert W. Miller, in what was then the Epidemiology Branch of NCI, began an exploration into the epidemiologic patterns of childhood and familial cancer about which little was known. Their search began with a systematic multicenter study of childhood cancer that suggested an excess of certain congenital anomalies (e.g., aniridia with Wilms tumor) and multiple primary cancers in the same individual (e.g., adrenocortical and brain tumors). At the same time, Dr. Fraumeni began to investigate a series of cancer-prone families that he identified while making rounds at the NIH Clinical Center. These families became the foundation for the DCEG familial cancer registry, which continues to this day. As expected, most of the familial aggregations were confined to a single type of cancer, but a few families were found to have an unusual diversity of tumors that was difficult to explain.</p>
<p><img class="right" alt="Frederick Li and Joseph Fraumeni at NIH in 1991" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=512238" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7280451" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="512238" rxinlineslot="104" />Soon thereafter, a remarkable familial occurrence came to the attention of Dr. Frederick P. Li, a research colleague at NCI. In an almost explosive manner, several members of one family developed a variety of tumors, notably childhood rhabdomyosarcoma and breast cancer, but also other forms of cancer among children and young adults in the line of descent. This observation prompted Drs. Li and Fraumeni to return to the multicenter survey of childhood tumors and expedite completion of a study of children diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma. In 1969, they reported their findings in two landmark papers that appeared in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i> and the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>. The striking diversity of tumors was at variance with the prevailing notion that familial susceptibility to cancer is usually site- or tissue-specific (see <a href="#Fig1">Figure 1</a>).</p>
<p><a id="Fig1"></a>&nbsp;</p>
<p><img class="center" alt="Figure 1. Pedigree of Family A from the first paper documenting the constellation of tumors in what would later come to be known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome." src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=512248" longdesc="/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2012-12/research-publications/Fig1-longdesc-hereditary-multicancer-syndrome" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7280450" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="512248" rxinlineslot="104" /></p>
<p>The spectrum of early-onset cancers was clarified in 1982, when Drs. Li and Fraumeni published in <i>JAMA</i> a 12-year prospective study of members of the original four families. There were 16 new cases of cancer, far exceeding expectations based on general population rates. The array of new cancers closely resembled the familial pattern that was initially reported. By the late 1980s, Drs. Li and Fraumeni had assembled 24 families with similar, well-documented manifestations of a multiple-cancer syndrome. A prospective study of all families provided epidemiologic evidence of an excess risk of diverse cancers affecting young people in a dominantly inherited pattern. Breast cancer and soft tissue and osteogenic sarcomas were especially prevalent, but the risks of acute leukemia, brain tumors, and adrenocortical neoplasms were elevated as well. As interest increased in this familial disorder, it generally became known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS).</p>
<p>As time passed, Drs. Li and Fraumeni collected biospecimens and collaborated with laboratory investigators using a variety of biomarkers to search for an underlying mechanism that might explain the familial susceptibility to multiple tumors. Success was limited, however, until collaboration with Dr. Stephen Friend and Dr. David Malkin at Harvard, along with Dr. Louise Strong at the MD Anderson Cancer Center, uncovered germline mutations of the <i>p53</i> tumor suppressor gene in five consecutive families. The finding was quickly confirmed and intensified clinical and molecular interest in LFS, particularly because somatic mutations of <i>p53</i> also were reported in a large proportion of cancers arising in the general population.</p>
<p>The discovery of inherited <i>p53</i> mutations provided an opportunity for predictive genetic testing and clinical intervention aimed at the early detection and management of tumors in LFS. The finding also brought into sharp focus a series of clinical, psychological, legal, and ethical problems that would likely extend to other cancer susceptibility genes that seemed on the verge of isolation at that time. The issues prompted a series of NCI-sponsored workshops that published recommendations about predictive genetic testing in cancer-prone families.</p>
<p>Over the next two decades, LFS work continued mainly outside of NCI until 2010, when <b>Sharon Savage, M.D.,</b> and <b>Phuong Mai, M.D.,</b> both of the Clinical Genetics Branch, organized a workshop that brought together researchers, clinicians, and members of affected families. An international consortium was formed to develop effective cancer prevention and risk-reduction strategies for LFS families, provide a platform for developing a support group for LFS families, and pool resources for further research into the biology and genetics of the syndrome. Working with other clinical investigators in the consortium, Drs. Savage and Mai launched a feasibility study to recruit LFS families into a new screening protocol study at NIH designed to identify effective methods for early cancer detection without the use of radiation, which is known to magnify the risk of cancer in <i>p53</i> gene carriers. Efforts also are being made to understand and manage the psychosocial aspects of this disease among LFS patients as well as their relatives and caretakers. So far, the study has enrolled 118 families at NIH, with many additional families being seen at extramural locations. &ldquo;Clearly, there is a desire across the LFS community for this type of study,&rdquo; Dr. Savage said. &ldquo;Families really want to do something to help understand and ultimately prevent this devastating disease.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At the end of the workshop, Dr. Strong commented, &ldquo;In the 1960s, studies of familial cancer generally focused on a single site, such as hereditary breast cancer. The initial description of a familial syndrome involving so many tumor types raised questions about the possibility of referral bias, chance events, or an environmental factor such as an oncogenic virus. It was the perseverance of Drs. Li and Fraumeni over 20 years; the prospective findings; and the convergence of clinical, epidemiological, and biological observations that convinced the medical and scientific community that there was, indeed, a distinctive syndrome of cancer susceptibility. The work of Drs. Li and Fraumeni reflects the power of the multidisciplinary approach of genetic epidemiology and its potential contribution toward a better understanding of cancer etiology and prevention.&rdquo;</p>

Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.,</b> is a poster containing a Chinese proverb attributed to Confucius. This proverb roughly translates as &#8220;When you drink the water, remember who dug the well.&#8221;</p><p>Dr. Fraumeni is one of those rare individuals who always remembers and honors the mentors and scientific leaders who paved the way. And yet, for the more than 300 people currently in DCEG, Dr. Fraumeni is the one &#8220;who dug the well&#8221; that initiated their research. For a majority of scientific themes under study across the Division, Dr. Fraumeni conducted seminal work showing the promise of that particular line of research for yielding clues to cancer etiology and prevention. Under his guidance, these research themes have flourished and expanded.</p><img alt="" class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=513999&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="513999" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410708" sys_siteid="475" /> <p>The well-known work on what is now called Li-Fraumeni syndrome laid the foundation for the many studies of familial cancer that Dr. Fraumeni and others have conducted in DCEG. These projects have had a significant impact not only on scientific discovery but also on the clinical management of hereditary cancer syndromes and related conditions. For example, by studying families at high risk for melanoma, DCEG researchers and their collaborators established that dysplastic nevi are precursors to familial and sporadic melanoma, identified the first major susceptibility genes for melanoma, published a clinical pathology atlas for melanoma and nevi, created training videos on how to manage high-risk families and individuals, and developed the first calculator to estimate an individual&#8217;s risk of developing melanoma.</p><img alt="A technician prepares single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping arrays for hybridization with human DNA." class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_contentid=514055&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="514055" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410706" sys_siteid="475" /> <p>Special emphasis is now being placed on determining the biological mechanisms of melanoma susceptibility through genome-wide association studies, exome sequencing, high-resolution array-based comparative genomic hybridization (array-CGH), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) sequencing (used to analyze protein interactions with DNA), and molecular profiling. The search for high-risk susceptibility genes is under way for several other familial cancers and precancerous syndromes, both common and rare, such as lymphoproliferative disorders; bone marrow failure syndromes; chordoma; osteosarcoma; and cancers of the ovary, lung, testis, and bladder.</p><p>In 1967, in the first published report of familial bladder cancer, Dr. Fraumeni described what might be viewed as a forerunner to DCEG&#8217;s interdisciplinary investigations of familial cancer. In striving to explain why bladder cancer developed in a man and his three sons, all of whom were smokers, Dr. Fraumeni brought the affected and unaffected family members to the NIH Clinical Center for a study of tryptophan metabolism, which was suspected at the time to play a role in bladder carcinogenesis.</p><p>Although the findings proved to be unremarkable, echoes of this approach reverberate in DCEG&#8217;s portfolio of studies that use molecular biomarkers to identify mechanisms of cancer susceptibility, including gene-environment interactions in familial and non-familial forms of cancer.</p><img alt="Arsenical emissions from a copper smelter in Montana." class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=513916&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="513916" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410703" sys_siteid="475" /> <p>Although studies of genetic susceptibility to cancer remain a major focus in DCEG, Dr. Fraumeni and his colleagues began, in the 1960s, a series of investigations designed to identify the role of environmental and occupational exposures in cancer etiology. Most informative was the landmark report in 1969 of a study of copper smelter workers in Montana that revealed a significant dose-related excess risk of lung cancer associated with exposure to inorganic arsenic. This was the first indication that inhaled arsenic is a respiratory carcinogen, and the finding was sufficiently robust to prompt the Occupational Safety and Health Administration to set new federal occupational exposure limits.</p><p>In 1975, interest in environmental cancer was further sparked by the publication of the first NCI cancer mortality atlas, which mapped the death rates for cancer across the United States at the county level. In view of the earlier report that occupational arsenical exposure is carcinogenic, it was not surprising to find elevated rates of lung cancer in counties with arsenic-emitting smelters, but further studies with fellow NCI researcher Dr. William Blot revealed that the elevated risk extended beyond the workforce to the residential population exposed to arsenical pollution emitted by the plants.</p><img alt="Thomas Mann, Robert Hoover, and Joseph Fraumeni examine a U.S. cancer mortality map in 1977." class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=513927&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="513927" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410704" sys_siteid="475" /> <p>The most dramatic geographic pattern for lung cancer was seen in the string of U.S. counties with markedly elevated rates along the southeast Atlantic coast. In a series of case-control studies conducted in this area with Dr. Blot and <b>Robert N. Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.,</b> Director of the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, the researchers found that the excess lung cancer was due to asbestos exposures associated with short-term shipyard work that took place during World War II.</p><p>In recent decades, the expanding portfolio of occupational and environmental studies in DCEG has been strengthened by increasingly sophisticated methods of exposure assessment to identify specific carcinogens and quantify the risks involved. The studies continue to have an impact on regulatory and public health policies, as illustrated by recent studies of workers exposed to diesel exhaust, formaldehyde, benzene, trichloroethylene, and agricultural pesticides.</p><p>The initial publication of the U.S. cancer maps was soon followed by similar atlases from other countries. Most remarkable was geographic clustering of various cancers in China, motivating Drs. Fraumeni and Blot, along with their colleagues, to collaborate with Chinese scientists in a series of epidemiologic studies in high-risk populations of various cancers. In efforts to explain the elevated rates of lung cancer among nonsmoking women in northern China, case-control studies implicated indoor air pollution from coal-burning stoves and cooking oil volatiles in poorly ventilated homes.</p><img alt="Woman cooking over a coal fire in China, an example of indoor air pollution." class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=514054&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="514054" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410705" sys_siteid="475" /> <p>More recent studies have focused on Xuan Wei province, which has the highest incidence of lung cancer in China, providing evidence for the International Agency for Research on Cancer to classify coal-combustion products as an established carcinogen. The research has extended to other high-risk populations in China and Asia, where genetic susceptibility markers for lung cancer have been identified through collaborative genome-wide association studies. Other ongoing studies instigated by geographic patterns include investigations of bladder cancer in northern New England; gallbladder cancer in Chile; and esophageal cancer in high-risk areas spanning the globe, including China, Iran, Kenya, and Brazil.</p><p>When Dr. Fraumeni arrived at NCI in 1962, he was asked to evaluate the potential cancer risk associated with exposure to polio vaccine that had been inadvertently contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40), known to be carcinogenic in laboratory animals. Public health concern was intense, but Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s report in <i>JAMA</i> in 1963 revealed no evidence of excess cancer risk among children who were exposed to those early batches of vaccine that contained SV40. When concern over SV40 resurfaced in the 1990s due to its apparent detection in human mesothelioma, brain, and other tumors, DCEG studies found that cancer risks did not increase among newborns and others who had received the SV40- contaminated vaccine.</p><p><img alt="" class="right" height="145" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_contentid=520237&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="520237" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410709" sys_siteid="475" width="256" />In addition to studies of the role of infectious agents in cancer risk, most notably HIV/AIDS and human papillomavirus, recent attention has centered on the impact of immunological alterations and inflammatory processes in cancer susceptibility.</p><p>A series of epidemiological studies was launched to evaluate the cancer risk following immunosuppression related to underlying medical conditions and their treatments, including the first study, with Dr. Hoover, that quantified the excess risk of lymphoma and other cancers among solid organ transplant recipients. This report, published in <i>The Lancet</i> in 1973, became a forerunner of current record-linkage studies of transplant-related cancers that encompass the majority of the U.S. population.</p><p>Another long-standing interest of Dr. Fraumeni and his colleagues has been the risk of cancer following chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, and radiotherapy, including their interactions with genetic, immunological, and lifestyle factors. These studies became the cornerstone of the expanding portfolio of DCEG research in radiation and hormonal epidemiology.</p><p>The studies described here represent only a few of Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s early wide-ranging research projects that, in retrospect, anticipated the next half century of cancer epidemiology in DCEG and elsewhere. His interdisciplinary approach to studies of high-risk populations continues to inspire lines of research across DCEG and around the world.</p><p><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1426&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_contentid=502987&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="502987" sys_dependentvariantid="1426" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410710" sys_siteid="475">Back to the December 2012 issue of <i>Linkage</i></a></p></div>]]></body>

In a case-control study conducted in North Carolina, an elevated risk was associated with long-term use of snuff among nonsmokers, reaching 50-fold for tissues in direct contact with tobacco. The published report in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> (Winn et al., 1981) stimulated congressional hearings that resulted in regulatory actions to control the advertising and labeling of smokeless tobacco and educational campaigns to reduce its use by young people.</li>

<ul>
<li>The excess risk of respiratory cancer among copper smelter workers (Lee and Fraumeni, 1969) and nearby residents (Blot and Fraumeni, 1975) exposed to inorganic arsenic has led to IARC&rsquo;s classification of airborne arsenic as a human carcinogen and to new OSHA exposure limits.</li>

In epidemiology, the relatively small studies of 300 or fewer subjects that predominated before the mid-1980s would not have adequate statistical power to investigate the relatively low-level effects of risk factors that are of particular interest today. Under the leadership of <b>Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.,</b> DCEG has partnered with NCI&#8217;s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS) to foster and support large-scale extramural-intramural consortial initiatives to assemble the substantial quantity of data and biospecimens necessary to conduct a wide range of epidemiologic studies.</p><p>An early example of &#8220;big science&#8221; involving extramural-intramural collaboration was the National Bladder Cancer Study, which DCEG launched in 1978 to examine the role of artificial sweeteners, notably saccharin, in the development of bladder cancer, a relationship suspected on the basis of laboratory animal studies. Because the expected risk was low, the investigators determined the need to enroll approximately 3,000 cases and 5,800 controls, about 10 times the size of a typical study of the era. Toward this end, DCEG investigators partnered with the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) program to conduct a multicenter, population-based study. In addition to shedding light on the major public health concern about saccharin use, the study provided an opportunity to investigate the effects of a wider range of lifestyle, environmental, and occupational exposures on bladder cancer risk.</p><img alt="" class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=518366&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="518366" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410696" sys_siteid="475" /> <p>In recent decades, epidemiologic research has become increasingly interdisciplinary, especially with the advent of new genomic and molecular markers that have sharpened our measures of causal factors and mechanisms as well as diverse outcomes. Biomarkers of cancer susceptibility initially took the form of studies that evaluated the risk associated with candidate genes, which were underpowered and led to many positive findings that could not be reproduced. DCEG was well positioned to foster and participate in large-scale consortia involving case-control, cohort, and family studies, a strategy through which genetic findings could be identified with some precision and then replicated rapidly and efficiently.</p><p>In 2002, extramural and intramural leaders of case-control studies of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) formed the international &#8220;InterLymph Consortium&#8221; to investigate a number of candidate genes suspected to confer susceptibility (see Figure 1). The Consortium identified the <i>TNF</i> gene as playing a role in NHL and, just as importantly, it ruled out the <i>IL1A</i> gene as a meaningful contributor to risk. InterLymph has now grown to include consortia for genome-wide and other studies of Hodgkin lymphoma and multiple myeloma.</p><p><img alt="International Lymphoma Epidemiology (InterLymph) study centers are located in the United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia." class="right" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=518365&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="518365" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410697" sys_siteid="475" /></p><p>In 2003, the Breast and Prostate Cancer and Hormone-Related Gene Variant Study (BPC3) was launched to enable large-scale analyses of candidate genes that affect hormone metabolism. The NCI study combined the resources of two intramural cohorts and six extramural cohorts, with prospectively gathered prediagnostic plasma samples; lymphocytes; body measurements; and extensive questionnaire data on diet, physical activity, exogenous hormones, smoking, and other lifestyle factors from more than 740,000 men and women, including 8,850 with prostate cancer and 6,160 with breast cancer. With the availability of high-throughput genomic and metabolic technologies for genome-wide association studies, the epidemiologic infrastructure has helped to unravel the role of genetic and hormonal risk factors for these tumors.</p><p>Family studies&#8211;based consortia also have been a focus for research on inherited mutations and cancer susceptibility. One of the earliest examples is the GenoMel Consortium, formed in 1997, in which DCEG joined forces with groups from more than 20 countries. The collaboration aims to identify and understand the genetic underpinnings of melanoma, including interactions with sun exposure and other risk factors, and their incorporation in risk-prediction models for individual patients.</p><p>Consortial strategies have more than proved the worth of large-scale collaborative research that incorporates innovative high-throughput technologies into robust epidemiologic designs to dissect the genetic and environmental components underpinning complex disorders such as cancer. NCI currently supports more than 50 consortia of various kinds. &#8220;Dr. Fraumeni recognized early on that for the kind of detective work it takes to unravel the complexities of cancer etiology, you need two things&#8212;teams of experts (because no one person can have all the expertise) and access to large numbers of study subjects and measurements of data so you can study the multiplicity of potential risk factors,&#8221; said Deborah M. Winn, Ph.D., Deputy Director of DCCPS. To date, the combined efforts of DCEG and DCCPS have led to dozens of epidemiologic consortia that are striving to inform clinical and public health interventions.</p><p>When asked to evaluate the future of collaborative studies in the era of molecular epidemiology, Dr. Fraumeni commented, &#8220;There are many challenges in establishing large-scale interdisciplinary studies, but we need such strategies if we hope to more fully understand the biological mechanisms of cancer induction and progression and the means of preventing and controlling cancer.&#8221;</p><p><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1426&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_contentid=502987&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="502987" sys_dependentvariantid="1426" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410699" sys_siteid="475">Back to the December 2012 issue of <i>Linkage</i></a></p></div>]]></body>

Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.,</b> recognized that the development of a strong research program requires attracting and training the next generation of scientists. Shortly after NCI established DCEG in 1995, Dr. Fraumeni created the DCEG Office of Education (OE) to oversee training and career development for various levels of scientific staff, coordinate the recruitment of postdoctoral fellows, develop and oversee predoctoral training partnerships with schools of public health, and establish and evaluate practices and policies. DCEG now provides unparalleled training for epidemiologists, biostatisticians, geneticists, clinicians, and laboratory scientists.</p><img alt="" class="left" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=518855&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="518855" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410772" sys_siteid="475" /> <p>Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s long-time mentor and colleague, Dr. Robert W. Miller, shaped Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s perspective on training and development in epidemiology at an early stage. Dr. Miller became Chief of the Epidemiology Branch at NCI in 1961, one year before Dr. Fraumeni joined NCI as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service.</p><p>&#8220;Bob was a marvelous mentor to all of us who joined his research program in positions equivalent to postdoctoral fellows,&#8221; said Dr. Fraumeni. &#8220;I believe I was his first and his longest serving prot&#233;g&#233; at NCI. He encouraged as much independence as we could handle, and he was generous in providing the guidance needed to pursue and complete our studies.&#8221;</p><p>In the early 1960s, the Epidemiology Branch was small. &#8220;In truth, epidemiologists in the United States devoted to cancer research were few and far between,&#8221; said Dr. Fraumeni. &#8220;Bob started from scratch to create an epidemiological research program with a strong clinical and interdisciplinary focus. He recruited and trained young physicians and scientists, many of whom have become leaders in the field.&#8221; Dr. Fraumeni soon followed in Dr. Miller&#8217;s footsteps, becoming a strong advocate for training within the NCI epidemiology research community.</p><p>DCEG&#8217;s fellowship training program has grown to more than 140 predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows. Predoctoral trainees include doctoral candidates, fellows who have obtained a master&#8217;s or baccalaureate degree, and summer students. Fellows comprise about one-third of DCEG&#8217;s workforce, and their contributions are vital to the Division&#8217;s research mission. DCEG maintains formal partnerships with the Yale University School of Public Health, the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, and the George Washington University School of Public Health and Health Services. These partnerships have yielded talented scientists who have launched their careers based on the research they completed while at DCEG.</p><p>As leaders for training in the Division, <b>Jackie Lavigne, Ph.D., M.P.H.,</b> Chief of OE, and <b>Kristin Kiser, M.H.A., M.S.,</b> fellowship coordinator, provide personalized support and opportunities for professional growth to fellows and scientific staff. Having an office dedicated to training across the Division enables DCEG to offer its fellows the potential to work with and learn from experts in many aspects of cancer epidemiology and genetics through direct mentorship, workshops, courses, and lecture series. Under the guidance of dedicated, experienced mentors, DCEG fellows gain in-depth experience in designing and executing research studies, analyzing data, and interpreting and publishing the results. Evidence of the success of trainees in the DCEG environment lies in their record of publishing the results of their innovative and high-quality research. Current and recent DCEG fellows are often the lead authors of papers published in the top scientific and medical journals.</p><p>DCEG also offers a variety of practical opportunities for fellows to develop a comprehensive set of professional skills, including giving research presentations (at local, national, and international meetings), planning scientific events, mentoring, and writing grant proposals. The Division provides a wide range of supplemental courses in such fields as molecular epidemiology, genetic analysis, radiation epidemiology, and dosimetry. Several DCEG lecture programs are available for fellows and staff, including the Visiting Scholars Program, the Distinguished Lecturer Series, and the weekly DCEG Seminar Series. Fellows have the opportunity to participate in many other activities, such as the Fellows Monthly Colloquia, Career Development Seminars, the annual DCEG Fellows&#8217; Training Symposium, and a variety of Institute and NIH meetings.</p><p>In June 2011, the North American Congress of Epidemiology recognized DCEG&#8217;s commitment to training by giving the Division the inaugural Alexander D. Langmuir Award for Training Program Excellence and Innovation. The award recognizes outstanding training programs in epidemiology that emphasize research experience and skills development, the application of epidemiology principles and advanced methods, and the importance of collaborative and integrative epidemiologic approaches. Dr. Lavigne accepted the award on behalf of DCEG during a ceremony at the Third North American Congress of Epidemiology in Montreal, Canada.</p><img alt="Jackie Lavigne receives the Alexander D. Langmuir Award on behalf of DCEG from John Vena and Stanley Weiss at the 2011 Congress of Epidemiology" class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=518857&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentid="518857" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410773" sys_siteid="475" /> <p>NCI has not tracked the number of people who have received training in epidemiology since Dr. Fraumeni arrived at the Institute in 1962. However, since NCI established DCEG in 1995, the Division has trained more than 600 outstanding cancer epidemiologists, many of whom are actively involved in epidemiology research in the United States and various other countries around the world. DCEG trainees are now working in academia, cancer centers and hospitals, federal and state government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and the private sector.</p><p>DCEG will continue to move forward, supporting and expanding Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s vision of training the next generation of cancer epidemiologists, biostatisticians, geneticists, and others by providing them with experience in evolving interdisciplinary research to meet the scientific challenges that lie ahead.</p><p><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1426&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_contentid=502987&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="502987" sys_dependentvariantid="1426" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="3410775" sys_siteid="475">Back to the December 2012 issue of <i>Linkage</i></a></p></div>]]></body>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield" xmlns:st2="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags2" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" xmlns:x="urn:www.microsoft.com/excel" xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office"><p>In May, DCEG was privileged to hold a panel discussion titled Cancer Epidemiology over the Last Half-century and Thoughts on the Future. The panel featured <b>Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.,</b> and Dr. David Schottenfeld, University of Michigan, co-editors of multiple editions of the indispensable textbook <i>Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention.</i> <b>Robert N. Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.,</b> Director of DCEG&#8217;s Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, moderated the discussion and posed questions on the major influences that affected the careers of Drs. Fraumeni and Schottenfeld, the key contributors and seminal discoveries in the field of cancer epidemiology, and advice for young epidemiologists. The full-capacity audience of NCI staff thoroughly enjoyed the panel members&#8217; thoughtful, gracious, enlightening, and often humorous responses.</p><img alt="" class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=518859" sys_dependentid="518859" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="7280464" sys_siteid="475" /> <p>Both Drs. Fraumeni and Schottenfeld initially had trained as clinicians, but influential mentors steered them toward careers in epidemiology. Dr. Schottenfeld was in his second year in the Epidemic Intelligence Service at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention when he was assigned to work with Dr. Abraham Lilienfeld at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health on a multi-hospital case-control study of male breast cancer. Dr. Schottenfeld recalled, &#8220;When I went to Hopkins, the chemistry with Abe Lilienfeld was perfect. On completing the project, I was persuaded to abandon my notion about being a practicing oncologist but instead pursue a career in cancer epidemiology and public health. The relationship that we developed was sustained throughout my career.&#8221;</p><p>Similarly, Dr. Fraumeni was encouraged to go into epidemiology by Dr. Rulon Rawson, chairman of the Department of Medicine at the Memorial Sloan- Kettering Cancer Center, where Dr. Fraumeni served as chief resident.</p><p>During weekly medical rounds, he was responsible for guiding Dr. Rawson to the most interesting cases on the wards. Dr. Fraumeni&#8217;s choices, however, led Dr. Rawson to remark, &#8220;You are thinking like an epidemiologist. It&#8217;s the patterns that you&#8217;re focusing on, and that&#8217;s epidemiology.&#8221; Dr. Rawson encouraged Dr. Fraumeni to consider spending time at NCI, where he was mentored by Dr. Robert W. Miller, then Chief of NCI&#8217;s Epidemiology Branch, who demonstrated the ways in which someone with a strong clinical orientation might contribute to epidemiologic research.</p><p>When asked to identify the cancer epidemiologists who have had the most significant impact on the field, Drs. Fraumeni and Schottenfeld agreed that the towering figure in cancer epidemiology, and epidemiology in general, was Sir Richard Doll at Oxford University in the United Kingdom. Professor Doll, along with Dr. Ernst Wynder in the United States, was the first to establish a causal relationship between cigarette smoking and lung cancer. However, Professor Doll&#8217;s contributions to epidemiology extended well beyond that landmark finding.</p><p>Dr. Fraumeni also cited Mr. William Haenszel, former Chief of NCI&#8217;s Biometry Branch, whose landmark studies of the changing cancer risks among migrant populations offered many key epidemiologic insights; Dr. Miller for his trailblazing work in clinical epidemiology and childhood cancer; and Dr. Alfred Knudson for his seminal contributions to cancer genetics. Dr. Schottenfeld also gave tribute to Sir Austin Bradford Hill. &#8220;His book <i>Principles of Medical Statistics</i> had an enormous impact on the medical profession, which tended not to think numerically or quantitatively,&#8221; Dr. Schottenfeld explained. He also credited other biostatisticians who have made important and lasting contributions by developing rigorous study methods and analytical approaches in epidemiology. They included Mr. Nathan Mantel, Mr. Jerome Cornfield, Dr. Norman Breslow, Mr. Nicholas Day, Dr. Kenneth Rothman, and Dr. Sander Greenland.</p><p>After describing the dominant influence of tobacco in cancer etiology, Dr. Fraumeni spoke about the changing themes that motivated epidemiologic research over time, such as the possible role of viral infections during the 1960s; environmental and occupational hazards during the 1970s; dietary practices, including fat intake, in the 1980s; and genetics from the 1990s on. For epidemiology, the genomics era began with family-based studies of rare, high-penetrant genes and vastly expanded as new technologies enabled genome-wide association studies to identify common low-penetrant genetic variants at the population level. Dr. Schottenfeld cited several remarkable discoveries in epidemiology that were transformative in nature, such as the roles of human papillomaviruses in cervical cancer, hepatitis B and C in liver cancer, asbestos exposure in lung cancer and mesothelioma, ionizing radiation in a wide variety of cancers, and the detection of low-level risks of lung cancer associated with passive smoking.</p><p>Drs. Fraumeni and Schottenfeld also discussed epidemiologic discoveries that were surprising at the time and caused paradigm shifts in thinking about cancer etiology. Among their examples were the association of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection with duodenal ulcer and gastric cancer; the complex and varied effects of steroid hormones on the risk of breast and other cancers; the protective effects of aspirin on colon cancer risk; the discovery of vaginal adenocarcinomas in the daughters of women treated with diethylstilbestrol during pregnancy, which called attention to the potential importance of early-life exposures for cancer etiology; and the growing evidence that obesity increases the risk of several forms of cancer.</p><p>When asked about notable &#8220;characters&#8221; in cancer epidemiology and what made them so interesting, Drs. Fraumeni and Schottenfeld agreed that Dr. Wynder was the most colorful. Dr. Schottenfeld described him as &#8220;dramatic, flamboyant, charismatic, and, at times, infuriating. He had endless ideas. The only issue was that <i>you</i> had to pursue them. But he was enormously productive with hundreds of important publications.&#8221; Dr. Fraumeni remarked that Dr. Wynder combined a very active professional <i>and</i> social life, recalling a dramatic moment at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center when Dr. Wynder strolled into the cafeteria with the movie star Kim Novak.</p><p>After commenting on non-epidemiologists who had a positive effect on the field and discussing what they considered to be their own personal successes, Drs. Fraumeni and Schottenfeld turned the discussion to the importance of training the next generation of scientists, a career-long passion for both men. Dr. Schottenfeld exhorted young investigators, &#8220;You are going to have to be life-long students. You must continue to learn and continue to master your methodologies. You need to experience passion and joy in the research or else don&#8217;t trouble yourselves with all the years of competing for funding. You need to be questioning, to be critical observers, to think &#8216;out of the box&#8217; in imaginative ways about questions, because it is framing the questions that&#8217;s the important issue.&#8221; Dr. Fraumeni encouraged young investigators to find the best possible mentors, work with compatible collaborators who have complementary skills, and carve out a niche in which to grow and eventually become an authority on the subject.</p><p>Drs. Fraumeni and Schottenfeld agreed that with imagination and resources, investigators should seize the opportunities to discover and investigate &#8220;natural experiments,&#8221; especially in the form of high-risk populations that provide etiologic clues. They also encouraged participation in large-scale collaborations and consortia when team science is warranted. Dr. Fraumeni concluded, &#8220;Despite the fact that we know so much more than we did 50 years ago, there is still an enormous amount that remains to be learned, and the opportunities in cancer epidemiology are greater than ever.&#8221;</p><p><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1426&amp;sys_contentid=502987" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="502987" sys_dependentvariantid="1426" sys_relationshipid="7280466" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1426" sys_contentid="502987">Back to the December 2012 issue of <i>Linkage</i></a></p></div>]]></body>

<p>The National Council on Radiation Protection &amp; Measurements estimates that the proportion of annual radiation exposure in the United States from medical sources has approximately tripled since the 1980s. In 2010, the President&rsquo;s Cancer Panel called for the elimination of unnecessary testing as well as improvements in equipment and operator skill to minimize radiation exposure. Information from DCEG&rsquo;s Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) helped provide the basis for the panel&rsquo;s concerns, and, since the report, REB has led new studies that shed further light on cancer risks related to low-dose diagnostic and screening procedures and to high-dose radiation therapy.</p>

<p><img class="right" alt="" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=537601" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6396580" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="537601" rxinlineslot="104" /><b>Amy Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez, D.Phil.,</b> senior investigator in REB, has focused her research attention on computed tomography (CT), which is the largest contributor to the recent increase in medical radiation. Although a lifesaving tool when used to help diagnose internal injuries or illness, CT scans often deliver a radiation dose that is up to 10 times higher than that of conventional x-rays. In addition, CT use has increased from approximately three million scans in 1980 to 70 million in 2007. Using information on the number of scans in the United States and radiation doses to various body organs, along with existing data on radiation-related cancer risks, Dr. Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez estimated that approximately 29,000 future cancers could be related to CT scans performed in the United States in 2007 alone. This risk projection prompted NIH to require that makers of scanners used at the NIH Clinical Center incorporate software to measure and track patients&rsquo; radiation doses over time. Dr. Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez was also a member of a National Academy of Sciences workshop committee that recently published recommendations on monitoring medical radiation exposures. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="CT-Scans-Children"></a>CT Scans and Children</h3>
<p>Pediatric CTs are of particular concern for several reasons: (1) children might receive a higher radiation dose than necessary if CT settings are not adjusted for children&rsquo;s smaller body size; (2) children are more sensitive to radiation than adults are; and (3) children have a longer life expectancy than adults do, providing more time for radiation exposure&ndash;related cancer to develop. With Dr. Mark Pearce and colleagues from Newcastle University in the United Kingdom (UK), Dr. Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez and <b>Mark Little, D.Phil.,</b> senior investigator in REB, recently published the results of a U.K.&ndash;NCI study of 180,000 children who underwent CT scans before age 22. The study is the first of its kind to show directly that pediatric CT scans are related to subsequent cancer risk. The report in <i>Lancet</i> showed small but statistically significant increased risks of leukemia and brain tumors within the first decade after the children&rsquo;s exposure to radiation.</p>
<p><b>Choonsik Lee, Ph.D.,</b> a tenure-track investigator in REB, developed radiation dose estimates for the study using innovative models (called &ldquo;phantoms&rdquo;) that approximated the size, shape, and composition of children&rsquo;s anatomies (<span style="color: #000000;"><a href="#Figure 1">see Figure 1</a></span>). Dr. Lee also developed new software, called NCICT, to assess organ doses from CT exams; the software is being used internationally in other studies of CTs.</p>
<p><a id="Figure 1"></a><img class="center" alt="Graphic shows three-dimensional front views of pediatric and adult phantoms: newborn, 1-year, 5-year, 10-year, 15-year male, 15-year female, adult male, adult female.

Later, the team also will be able to pool data with the ongoing European EPI-CT study to evaluate risk among approximately 2 million children.</p>
<h3><a id="Translating-Research-Results"></a>Translating Research Results Into Clinical Practice</h3>
<p><img class="left" alt="" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=532574" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6396575" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="532574" rxinlineslot="104" />The research on risks associated with CTs is affecting clinical practice. Radiology professional groups have joined forces to conduct the Image Wisely<sup>&reg;</sup> and Image Gently<sup>&reg;</sup> campaigns to address concerns about the increasing exposure of adults and children to radiation from medical imaging. Dr. Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez noted, &ldquo;Pediatricians are particularly interested and receptive to the issues of over-imaging in children. In the U.K., there are attempts to change the approach from immediately ordering a CT to having longer clinical observation times in the emergency room and conducting magnetic resonance imaging the following day if imaging is still deemed necessary.&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Understanding the Effects of High-Dose Radiation Treatment</h3>
<p><img class="right" alt="" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=532842" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6396576" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="532842" rxinlineslot="104" />In addition to diagnostic radiation from CTs, REB investigators study the long-term effects of high-dose radiation used to treat cancer. <b>Lindsay M. Morton, Ph.D.,</b> a tenure-track investigator, is leading a large investigation of second cancers of the gastrointestinal tract among patients who received radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma or breast, testicular, or cervical cancer. The study involves collaborators from seven countries, including Dr. Lois B. Travis, former member of REB and currently at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who initiated the study.</p>
<p>The first report from this complex project, published in the <i>Annals of Oncology</i>, described the risks of esophageal cancer among approximately 290,000 women treated for breast cancer. The researchers obtained detailed radiation dosimetry data for 252 women who developed esophageal cancer and 488 women who did not. Because the radiation dose varied more than 20-fold along the length of the esophagus, depending on the location of the radiation treatment fields used to target the breast cancer, Dr. Morton based her analysis on the dose at the location of the esophageal tumor. Esophageal cancer risk increased with increasing radiation dose to the esophageal tumor location, reaching 8.3-fold at doses at or above 35 Gray (<span style="color: #000000;"><a href="#Figure 2">see Figure 2</a></span>). Radiation and other esophageal cancer risk factors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and family history of cancer, had multiplicative effects.</p>
<p><a id="Figure 2"></a><img class="center" alt="" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=537603" longdesc="/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2013-03/research-publications/medradfig2-longdesc" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6396578" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="537603" rxinlineslot="104" />Dr. Morton and her colleagues are analyzing the other components of the study and expect to report soon on the risks for stomach and pancreatic cancers after radiation treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma, testicular cancer, and cervical cancer. Dr. Morton noted, &ldquo;Future research should focus on identifying patients at highest risk for developing radiation-related second cancers&mdash;whether because of the specific treatments they received, other exposures, or inherited predisposition.&rdquo; Understanding the basis of individual susceptibility has important clinical and public health implications for both prevention and treatment of malignancies.</p>
<h3>Cancer Susceptibility Factors and Treatment-Related Second Cancers</h3>
<p><b>Ruth A. Kleinerman, M.P.H.,</b> a staff scientist in REB, <b>Margaret A. Tucker, M.D.,</b> Acting Director of DCEG and Director of the Human Genetics Program, and long-time collaborators Dr. David Abramson of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and Dr. Johanna Seddon of Tufts Medical Center have evaluated cancer susceptibility factors in a cohort of retinoblastoma (RB) survivors who have been followed for almost 30 years. RB survivors experience elevated risk of sarcomas, mainly in the area that was treated with radiotherapy. <img class="right" alt="" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=537604" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6396579" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="537604" rxinlineslot="104" />The investigators, along with Dr. Little and Dr. Chu-Ling Yu, a former REB research fellow, recently reported in the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i> that RB survivors with bilateral disease and an inherited germline mutation in the <i>RB1</i> tumor suppressor gene are at slightly higher risk of a second cancer, particularly melanoma, than RB survivors with a <i>de novo</i> germline mutation, perhaps because of shared genetic alterations. Dr. Morton also is working with Ms. Kleinerman, Dr. Tucker, and <b>Jeannette Wong, M.P.H.,</b> a predoctoral fellow in REB, to identify the specific <i>RB1</i> mutations associated with the development of sarcomas or melanomas among RB survivors compared with RB survivors who did not develop a second cancer.</p>
<h3><a id="Evaluating-New-Technologies"></a>Evaluating New Technologies</h3>
<p>Although REB investigators conduct research on radiation modalities that were used in the past or that, like CTs, increased in use during the previous decades, the investigators also are alert to the need to evaluate new technologies as they are introduced or as they become widespread in use. <b>Martha S. Linet, M.D., M.P.H.,</b> Chief of REB, noted, &ldquo;We have found that often the best first step in evaluating new imaging technologies is to study the clinicians or radiologic technologists who administer the tests or treatments. They have repeated exposure and wear radiation dosimetry badges, which helps us determine their exposures accurately.&rdquo; Studying these occupational groups can inform risk projections for patients and help indicate whether a full-scale study of patients might be worthwhile. REB investigators are currently assessing cancer and other mortality among physicians performing fluoroscopically guided interventional procedures and among radiologic technologists assisting with fluoroscopic or nuclear medicine procedures. Branch scientists plan to investigate the feasibility of studying second cancer risks among patients receiving intensity-modulated or proton radiotherapy.</p>

In recent years, scientists and clinicians have used this knowledge to develop two successful and complementary preventive methods: (1) vaccination against HPV infection and (2) HPV testing. HPV testing detects treatable cervical cancer precursors with greater sensitivity than can be achieved by the Pap test (cytology) alone.</p><h3>Formulating Screening and Clinical Management Guidelines</h3><p><img alt="" class="right" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=571187" sys_dependentid="571187" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="6585666" sys_siteid="475" />DCEG staff members have contributed substantially to a series of guideline meetings focused on introducing HPV testing into cervical screening programs in the United States. The first set of meetings addressed general screening, or the testing of presumed normal women. These meetings led to the publication of new screening guidelines in 2012 (described in the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1955&amp;sys_contentid=351109" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="351109" sys_dependentvariantid="1955" sys_relationshipid="6585667" sys_siteid="475">July 2012 issue of <i>Linkage</i></a>). Multiple organizations, including the American Cancer Society, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, endorsed the use of concurrent HPV testing with Pap testing (referred to as co-testing) at five-year intervals for women who test negative on both tests. Compared with current practice, the new guidelines recommend longer intervals between routine screenings. <b>Mark Schiffman, M.D., M.P.H.,</b> a senior investigator in the Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), noted, &#8220;The high sensitivity and negative predictive value of HPV DNA testing make the test amenable to fewer screens in a lifetime than Pap testing.&#8221; <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=571824" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="571824" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="6585668" sys_siteid="475"><img alt="why screen if there is a vaccine" class="right" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=571851" sys_dependentid="571851" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="6585669" sys_siteid="475" /></a></p><p>With new screening guidelines in place, the focus turned to reaching agreement on the clinical management of women who test positive when screened for HPV. To support this goal, DCEG scientists, in collaboration with Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), used data from 1.4 million KPNC members to provide key evidence for the formulation of new risk-based guidelines for the clinical management of women with abnormal cervical cancer screening tests. The resulting 2012 American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology Consensus Guidelines and the eight reports with the supporting data from the KPNC study were published in a 2013 supplement of the <a href="http://journals.lww.com/jlgtd/toc/2013/04001"><i>Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease</i></a>.</p><p>The screening and clinical management strategies included in the guidelines are based on essential features of the natural history of cervical cancer: infection with HPV; persistence, rather than clearance, of the infection; development of a precancerous precursor lesion (effectively, carcinoma <i>in situ</i>); and invasion. Because all cervical cancer cases go through these steps, scientists can develop algorithms based on precancer and cancer rates among women with similar test results who have been followed over time. These calculations can then be used for managing women with various results from HPV testing, Pap testing, and colposcopy (a diagnostic exam during which biopsies are taken).&#160;</p><h3>Equal Management of Equal Risks</h3><p>Risk prediction models developed by DCEG were pivotal to the development of the new screening guidelines that recommend HPV-Pap co-testing as the primary screening method, with longer intervals between routine screens. This approach was applied to the management guidelines. Risk calculations reduce a complex battery of tests over time into a single number that forms the basis for action. <b>Hormuzd A. Katki, Ph.D.,</b> a tenure-track investigator in the Biostatistics Branch and lead author on the reports supporting the new management guidelines, explained, &#8220;If two different combinations of test results imply the same risk of disease, then we manage them similarly. This is the principle of &#8216;equal management of equal risks.&#8217;&#8221;</p><p>Risk calculations for HPV-Pap co-testing were compared, or benchmarked, with implicit risk thresholds underlying previously accepted Pap-only screening. For example, at KPNC, women with low-grade Pap results, for which immediate colposcopy is currently prescribed, have a five-year risk of 5.2 percent of developing precancer or cancer. Therefore, under the new guidelines, women with any combination of HPV and Pap results that carries a five-year risk of 5.2 percent or more of developing precancer or cancer should be referred for colposcopy. Women with a five-year risk of around 2.6 percent should be advised to return for testing in one year, because that has been the accepted practice for women with an equivocal Pap result. Women with a five-year risk below 0.26 percent need not return for screening for three years because they have risk equal to a woman with a negative Pap test.</p><p>Through long-term follow-up of the women in the KPNC study, which began HPV-Pap co-testing in 2003, DCEG investigators and their KPNC collaborators determined the risks of disease for various combinations of HPV and Pap test results. Dr. Katki and his colleagues conducted separate analyses for each combination of HPV and Pap results to calculate risk and then compared their analyses with the benchmark Pap-only thresholds to develop clinical management recommendations. The analyses considered sequential HPV-Pap test results, biopsy results, and excisional treatments for precancers. Because of the large number of women in the study, the excellent follow-up rate, and the detailed medical information, the analyses were powerful enough to detect clinically meaningful distinctions even for the lowest levels of risk. &#160;</p><h3>Mixed Screening Results Spur Efforts to Develop New Biomarkers</h3><p>The addition of HPV testing to cytology is creating novel screening results. One of the most challenging subgroups is comprised of women with positive HPV tests but negative Pap tests (<a href="#figure">see Figure 1</a>). Although the longer-term risk of precancer and cancer is elevated among women in this subgroup, cytology is still normal. The positive HPV test could reflect a transient infection that will clear on its own or a very early precancer that might not yet be detectable on biopsy. Thus, without evidence of abnormal Pap results, immediate referral for colposcopy is not recommended for this subgroup. Instead, these women are counseled to return for testing in one year. If infection persists, the risk of precancer and cancer is much higher and referral for colposcopy is then appropriate.</p><p><a id="figure"></a><i>Click on the figure below to enlarge</i>. <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=571661" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="571661" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="6585670" sys_siteid="475"><img alt="Figure 1 depicts the 5-year risk of precancer or cancer among HPV positive and HPV negative women with negative Pap test results, and the corresponding risk thresholds for clinical management.

The figure shows that women with a co-test result of HPV negative and Pap negative have a 0.08% risk of precancer or cancer after five years and fall below the threshold for a three year return examination. Women with a co-test result of HPV positive and Pap negative have a five year risk of 4.5% and fall just below the threshold for a biopsy referral." class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=571188" sys_dependentid="571188" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="6585671" sys_siteid="475" /></a></p><p>However, as <b>Nicolas Wentzensen, M.D., Ph.D., M.S.,</b> a senior investigator &#160;in the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch, explained, &#8220;It is far from ideal to wait for one year to see if HPV clears naturally. We need new biomarkers to identify infections that are destined to persist and cause precancer or cancer.&#8221; Promising biomarkers include <i>p16/Ki67</i> dual staining, HPV genotyping, HPV genome methylation, and HPV RNA testing. Dr. Wentzensen and colleagues are evaluating several of these biomarkers within Kaiser and another DCEG project called the Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants as well as the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial, which provides the opportunity to evaluate biomarkers in a vaccinated population.</p><h3>Possible Screening Strategies Outside the United States</h3><p>In the interest of applying HPV testing globally, Dr. Schiffman and colleagues have investigated whether alternative screening strategies are needed in low-resource countries or in countries in which the age patterns for HPV infection differ from those of the United States. In the United States, the prevalence of HPV infection peaks among women in their 20s and declines with age.</p><p><b>Julia C. Gage, Ph.D., M.P.H.,</b> a research fellow in CGB, described a project she conducted in Nigeria, where the prevalence of carcinogenic HPV infection remains high at all ages. &#8220;In each region, we need to adjust the screening program to fit the age-specific HPV prevalence pattern and available treatments,&#8221; Dr. Gage said. &#8220;In sub-Saharan Africa, although HPV prevalence does not decline with age, HPV-based screening programs might still be best targeted to mid-adult women because treatment of precancers found is most feasible before menopause.&#8221;</p><h3>Helping Clinicians Manage Risk in the Face of Increasing Complexity</h3><p>Although the new guidelines are a substantial step forward in incorporating the principles of benchmarking and &#8220;equal management of equal risk&#8221; into the full screening and management program, the resulting complexity is a challenge for clinicians. The complexity will only increase in the future as guidelines are updated to incorporate new biomarkers, such as HPV genotyping and <i>p16/Ki67,</i> and to address the screening of vaccinated women. One solution is to create a hand-held computer application for clinicians that would present HPV risk estimates based on the best data and evidence from sources all over the United States and the world. Perhaps, the management guidelines could be included as well.</p><p>&#8220;If guidelines are too complex, clinicians&#8217; and patients&#8217; compliance may be reduced,&#8221; Dr. Katki explained. &#8220;Calculating risk of cervical precancer or cancer for each combination of clinical tests may be the best way to cut through the complexity. Although these new guidelines are a big step forward, much work remains to bring the benefits of HPV testing to all women worldwide.&#8221;</p><p><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1426&amp;sys_contentid=567898" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="567898" sys_dependentvariantid="1426" sys_relationshipid="6585672" sys_siteid="475">Back to the July 2013 issue of <i>Linkage</i></a></p></div>]]></body>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield" xmlns:st2="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags2" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" xmlns:x="urn:www.microsoft.com/excel" xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office">
<p>In 2005, DCEG launched its first genome-wide association study (GWAS) as part of the NCI Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) initiative with the hope of uncovering novel genetic variations within the human genome that convey measurable cancer risk or protection among the general population. These variations would serve as leads for future research to identify the unique biologic mechanisms underlying the associations, thereby unifying epidemiologic, basic, and clinical scientists in a new area of multi-disciplinary translational research. The success of GWAS in producing these leads resulted in the establishment of DCEG’s Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG), which has led several follow-up studies since its inception in 2007.</p>

<p>Findings from LTG have confirmed that the promises of GWAS are being realized. Recently, <b>Ludmila Prokunina-Olsson, Ph.D.,</b> a tenure-track investigator in LTG, and her team examined a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the <i>PSCA</i> gene that had been identified earlier in DCEG’s GWAS of bladder cancer. The PSCA protein is commonly expressed on the surface of tumor cells of different cancer types and is currently being tested as a potential drug target for treatments of prostate and pancreatic cancers. Dr. Prokunina-Olsson and her colleagues at LTG, NCI’s Center for Cancer Research, and other institutions used 278 bladder tumor samples collected from patients from DCEG’s New England Bladder Cancer Study and found the risk allele to be the strongest factor predicting surface expression of PSCA in bladder tumors, clearly separating these tumors into PSCA positive and negative (<a href="#Figure1">see Figure 1</a>).</p>

<p><a id="Figure1"><img alt="Representative images and immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis of PSCA expression of bladder tumor tissue microarrays." longdesc="/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2013-07/research-publications/trans-res-fig1-longdesc" class="center" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=591255" sys_dependentid="591255" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="6585684" sys_siteid="475" /></a></p>

<p>“This is an exciting finding,” Dr. Prokunina-Olsson said, “that suggests that specific therapies targeting PSCA could be effective in bladder cancer patients, and testing patients for the risk allele could be an important tool of precision medicine to predict treatment success.” Based on the frequency of this genetic variant, the anti-PSCA treatment might be beneficial to as many as 75 percent of all bladder patients. This work was published online in the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23266392"><i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i></a> in December 2012.</p>

<p>DCEG’s translational efforts resulted in other exciting news when Dr. Prokunina-Olsson and <b>Thomas O’Brien, M.D., M.P.H.,</b> a senior investigator in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB), published work in <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23291588">Nature Genetics</a> in January 2013 on a follow-up study of recent GWAS findings implicating SNPs near the <i>IFNL3</i> gene as playing a role in the clearance of the hepatitis C virus (HCV), either spontaneously or in response to treatment. Chronic infection of HCV is a common cause of liver cancer, and identifying mechanisms responsible for HCV clearance is important in the clinical management of the disease, which is difficult to treat. Because of the challenges in linking the newly discovered variants to the likely candidate genes, Drs. Prokunina-Olsson and O’Brien conducted RNA sequencing in purified human liver cells treated <i>in vitro</i> to mimic HCV infection, which provided the investigators with a complete view of all genes expressed in the region of interest. Their work resulted in the discovery of a previously unknown gene in the interferon family, interferon lambda 4 (<i>IFNL4</i>).</p>

<p>Interferons are known to have broad effects in innate immunity that are important in infectious diseases and cancer. Remarkably, the existence of IFNL4 protein is found to be under complete genetic control: A deletion of one nucleotide within the first exon causes a frameshift and creates the IFNL4 protein, whereas the other allele does not create this interferon. The presence of the deletion allele and the IFNL4 protein results in poorer HCV clearance (<a href="#Figure2">see Figure 2</a>).</p>

<p>The deletion allele is also more common among populations of African descent, which potentially explains why African-American patients have poorer response to current HCV treatments compared with individuals from other populations. “Not only does this finding add to our understanding of human immune response to viral infection,” Dr. O’Brien said, “but we’ve also identified a potential new clinical marker that predicts treatment outcomes better than the test currently in use.” The finding also opens the door to the development of new potential treatments for HCV. Drs. Prokunina-Olsson and O’Brien are now working with colleagues in and outside of NIH to evaluate the role of the <i>IFNL4</i> gene in relation to other diseases and the response to IFN-alpha–based treatment of HCV and melanoma.</p>

These contributions may include formulating research ideas, developing study designs, conducting fieldwork and analysis, or interpreting results. Each of the recognized fellows also must have played a major role in drafting a manuscript. Special consideration is given to projects in which fellows demonstrate growth beyond the discipline of their previous training.&#160;</p><p>The D-FARE program was established because scientific meetings are integral to the fellowship experience. The awards enable a greater number of fellows to participate in meetings, where they present their work, hear about new scientific developments, and establish vital connections with other scientists.</p><p>This year, seven D-FARE winners were chosen by members of an ad hoc DCEG committee. Winners received a $1,500 travel award to present their research at a scientific meeting.</p><p>The 2014 D-FARE recipients and the titles of their abstracts are:</p><p><a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=302623&amp;sys_revision=48&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_folderid=#Arem" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302623" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4137788" sys_siteid="475">Hannah Arem, M.H.S., Ph.D.</a><br />&#8220;Leisure time physical activity and mortality: Is more better?&#8221;</p><p><a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=302456&amp;sys_revision=43&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_folderid=#Bodelon" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302456" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4137789" sys_siteid="475">Clara Bodelon, Ph.D., M.S.</a><br />&#8220;Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) scans and detection of ovarian cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) trial&#8221;</p><p><a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=302456&amp;sys_revision=43&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_folderid=#Felix" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302456" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4137790" sys_siteid="475">Ashley S.

Glenn, M.D., Ph.D., retired from NCI after 30 years of government service. Dr. Glenn received her M.D. in 1976 and a Ph.D. in molecular biology in 1979 from the University of Pennsylvania Schools of Medicine and Graduate School, respectively, in Philadelphia. She completed her internship and internal medicine residency in 1982, becoming board certified in internal medicine. After oncology fellowship training at the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore, Maryland, Dr. Glenn joined NCI&rsquo;s Laboratory of Immunobiology in 1984. While there, she began molecular biology investigations with her colleagues that led to identification of the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) disease gene, the first of several hereditary kidney cancer susceptibility genes identified later by this group of multidisciplinary associates.</p>
<p>Dr. Glenn became credentialed at the NIH Clinical Center, and over the next decades she combined research work with clinical responsibilities, all focused on hereditary kidney cancer. During her subsequent service in the NCI Cancer Diagnosis Branch, Dr. Glenn received the Public Health Service Special Achievement Award for her work in clinical investigative screening.</p>
<p>In 1996, Dr. Glenn joined DCEG&rsquo;s Genetic Epidemiology Branch, where she continued as physician and clinical genetic investigator in the screening clinic. In early 2010, Dr. Glenn joined the Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB). As a staff clinician, she participated in and contributed to CGB's ongoing studies of familial testicular cancer and inherited bone marrow failure syndromes, and the new study of <i>DICER1</i>-related familial pleuropulmonary blastoma.</p>

We are deeply indebted to her for her service, both to the NIH/NCI scientific enterprise and her dedication to the countless men and women afflicted by hereditary kidney cancer. Their lives have benefited beyond measure from her life&rsquo;s work.&rdquo;</p>

The authors confirmed this association in over 186,000 women enrolled in the <a href="http://dietandhealth.cancer.gov/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study</a>, of whom about 7,500 developed invasive breast cancer during almost 10 years of follow-up. A major strength of the study was that the authors were able to control for alcohol consumption, which is known to increase the risk of breast cancer, and is more common among smokers.</p>

<p>Scientists have identified a rare inherited mutation in a gene that can increase the risk of familial melanoma, according to a study that appeared online in <i>Nature Genetics</i> on March 30, 2014. Although the finding does not offer immediate benefit to patients, variation in the Protection of Telomeres-1 (<i>POT1</i>) gene provides additional clues as to the origins of melanoma and may open new avenues in prevention and treatment research.</p>

<h4 id="Gene-Environment">Gene-Environment Interaction</h4>
<p>A genome-wide interaction study based on primary scan data from 3,002 bladder cancer cases and 4,411 controls identified 10 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that provided evidence of interaction with tobacco use. Included were two novel SNPs (rs1711973 [<i>FOXF2</i>] and rs12216499 [<i>RSPH3-TAGAP-EZR</i>] on 6p25.3) that showed strong evidence of association with bladder cancer in tobacco use subgroups and approached genome-wide significance.

<h3 id="Brain">Brain Tumors</h3>
<h4 id="Benign-Brain">Benign Brain Tumor Risk Among Cancer Survivors</h4>
<p>Using data from the NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, the authors showed that the risk of second benign brain tumors, particularly meningioma, increases following first primary cancers of the brain/central nervous system, thyroid, prostate, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Radiation exposure likely contributes to these excess risks. (Kutsenko A, Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez A, Curtis RE, Rajaraman P. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24682745" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Risk of second benign brain tumors among cancer survivors in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program</a>. <i>Cancer Causes Control</i> 2014;25:659&ndash;668)</p>
<p><a href="#Cancer">Back to Cancer Topics</a></p>
<h3 id="Breast">Breast Cancer</h3>
<h4 id="Endometrial-Thickness-Breast">Endometrial Thickness</h4>
<p>Data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial suggest that endometrial thickness as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound is a biological marker of excess estrogen stimulation and is associated with postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer. (Felix AS, Weissfeld JL, Pfeiffer RM, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23907658" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Endometrial thickness and risk of breast and endometrial carcinomas in the prostate, lung, colorectal and ovarian cancer screening trial</a>. <i>Int J Cancer</i> 2014;134:954&ndash;960)</p>
<h4 id="Estrogen-Metabolism">Estrogen Metabolism</h4>
<p>The authors conducted a case-cohort study within the Breast and Bone Follow-up to the Fracture Intervention Trial to assess serum estrogens and estrogen metabolites in relation to breast cancer risk and found increased risk associated with elevated circulating estradiol and reduced risk associated with a higher ratio of the 2/16-hydroxylation pathways. (Dallal CM, Tice JA, Buist DS, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24213602" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Estrogen metabolism and breast cancer risk among postmenopausal women: A case-cohort study within B~FIT</a>. <i>Carcinogenesis</i> 2014;35:346&ndash;355)</p>
<h4 id="Fertility">Fertility Drugs</h4>
<p>Follow-up of 9,892 women evaluated for infertility between 1965 and 1988 at five U.S. sites showed that overall, those who took clomiphene citrate (brand name Clomid) or gonadotropins were not at increased risk for breast cancer. The authors reported elevated breast cancer risk among a subset of women in the study: those who remained nulligravid after treatment with gonadotropins, which may be related to underlying causes of infertility; and women who had 12 or more cycles of clomiphene, a finding which warrants continued monitoring. (Brinton LA, Scoccia B, Moghissi KS, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24700523" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Long-term relationship of ovulation-stimulating drugs to breast cancer risk</a>. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</i> 2014;23:584&ndash;593)</p>
<h4 id="Genetic-Predisposition-Lobular">Genetic Predisposition to Lobular Carcinoma</h4>
<p>A pooling study based on 6,023 breast cancer cases and 34,271 controls identified a novel lobular breast cancer&ndash;specific predisposition polymorphism at 7q34. This finding showed for the first time that common breast cancer polymorphisms predispose to lobular carcinoma <i>in situ</i> and that many of the estrogen receptor positive (ER+) breast cancer predisposition loci also predispose to invasive lobular breast cancer, although some heterogeneity exists between ER+ lobular and ER+ intraductal carcinomas. (Sawyer E, Roylance R, Petridis C, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24743323" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Genetic predisposition to <i>in situ</i> and invasive lobular carcinoma of the breast</a>. <i>PLoS Genet</i> 2014;10:e1004285)</p>
<h4 id="Breast-Genetic-Susceptibility">Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>Using data from 38 case-control studies, the authors assessed 41 common non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) for which some evidence of association with breast cancer risk had been previously reported. Strong evidence of association was observed for a novel susceptibility locus at 3p21 (rs1053338), a previously suggested locus rs6964587 at 7q21, and locus rs10510592 at 3p24, for which the association was substantially attenuated after adjustment for the known genome-wide association study hit. (Milne RL, Burwinkel B, Michailidou K, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24943594">Common non-synonymous SNPs associated with breast cancer susceptibility: Findings from the Breast Cancer Association Consortium</a>. <i>Hum Mol Genet</i> 2014;Jun 18 [E-pub ahead of print])</p>
<h4 id="Male-Breast">Male Breast Cancer</h4>
<p>Analyses within the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project, a consortium of 11 case-control and 10 cohort investigations involving 2,405 cases and 52,013 controls, showed risk associated with weight, height, and body mass index (BMI), particularly recent BMI, Klinefelter syndrome, gynecomastia, diabetes, cryptorchidism, orchitis, and never having children. (Brinton LA, Cook MB, McCormack V, et al. <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/research-news-highlights/2014/male-breast-cancer-risk-factor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anthropometric and hormonal risk factors for male breast cancer: Male breast cancer pooling project results</a>. <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2014;106:djt465)</p>
<h4 id="Smoking">Smoking</h4>
<p>Data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study showed an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer among women who smoke or have smoked in the past, particularly among those without a family history or late menarche. (Nyante SJ, Gierach GL, Dallal CM, et al. <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/research-news-highlights/2014/smoking-breast-cancer-risk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cigarette smoking and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in a prospective cohort</a>. <i>Br J Cancer</i> 2014;110:2339&ndash;2347)</p>

<h4 id="Multiple-HPV">Infection with Multiple Human Papillomavirus Genotypes</h4>
<p>Using a population-based stratified sample of 59,664 cervical cytology specimens from women residing in New Mexico, the authors did not see more than additive effects of human papillomavirus types on the risk of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions among women infected with multiple types. (Wentzensen N, Nason M, Schiffman M, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24179110" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">No evidence for synergy between human papillomavirus genotypes for the risk of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions in a large population-based study</a>. <i>J Infect Dis</i> 2014;209:855&ndash;864)</p>

<h4 id="Endometrial-Thickness-Endometrium">Endometrial Thickness</h4>
<p>Data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial suggest that endometrial thickness as assessed by transvaginal ultrasound is a biological marker of excess estrogen stimulation and is associated with postmenopausal breast cancer and endometrial cancer.

<h3 id="Gastrointestinal">Gastrointestinal Cancer</h3>
<h4 id="Folate">Folate and the One-Carbon Metabolism Pathway</h4>
<p>In a prospective study, the authors observed an association of low intake of folate with an elevated risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma but not with esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, or non-cardia gastric adenocarcinoma. The intakes of methionine, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 were not associated with esophageal and gastric cancer. (Xiao Q, Freedman ND, Ren J, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24481406" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intakes of folate, methionine, vitamin B6, and vitamin B12 with risk of esophageal and gastric cancer in a large cohort study</a>. <i>Br J Cancer</i> 2014;110:1328&ndash;1333)</p>
<h4 id="Gallstones-Cholecystectomy">Gallstones and Cholecystectomy</h4>
<p>Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database, the authors observed that gallstones and cholecystectomy&mdash;which cause inflammation, altered bile flux, and changes in metabolic hormone levels&mdash;were associated with increased risk of noncardia gastric cancer, small-intestine carcinoid, liver cancer, and pancreatic cancer. (Nogueira L, Freedman ND, Engels EA, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24470530" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gallstones, cholecystectomy, and risk of digestive system cancers</a>. <i>Am J Epidemiol</i> 2014;179:731&ndash;739)</p>
<h4 id="H-Pylori-Treatment"><i>Helicobacter pylori</i> Treatment</h4>
<p>The fifteen-year follow-up of a randomized clinical trial of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i>-seropositive subjects found that one-time treatment with amoxicillin-omeprazole was associated with a statistically significant decrease in gastric cancer incidence (odds ratio = 0.36) and mortality (hazard ratio = 0.26) among subjects aged 55 years or older at baseline, and a statistically significant decrease in incidence among those with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia at baseline (odds ratio = 0.56). Treatment benefits for incidence and mortality among those with and without post-treatment infection were similar. The study suggests that <i>H. pylori</i> treatment can benefit an entire population, not just the young or those with mild histopathology. (Li WQ, Ma L, Zhang L, et al. &nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925350">Effects of <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> Treatment on Gastric Cancer Incidence and Mortality in Subgroups</a>. <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2014;Jun 12 [E-pub ahead of print])</p>
<h4 id="Metabolic">Metabolic Syndrome</h4>
<p>Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare linked database compared with two control groups (Medicare population controls and endoscopy controls), the authors found that metabolic syndrome increased the risk of Barrett esophagus compared with population controls, but not the endoscopy controls, with the association driven by and confined to those without gastroesophageal reflux disease.

<h4 id="Survival-EBV">Survival in Relation to Tumor Epstein-Barr Virus Positivity</h4>
<p>In a follow-up study of 4,599 gastric cancer patients diagnosed between 1976 and 2010 in Asia, Europe, and Latin America, Epstein-Barr virus positivity of tumors was associated with lower mortality, even after adjusting for stage at diagnosis and other confounders.

<h4 id="Vitamin">Vitamin and Mineral Supplement Use</h4>
<p>Data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study showed no association of multivitamin use with reduced risk of four highly fatal upper gastrointestinal cancers (esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, esophageal adenocarcinoma, gastric noncardia adenocarcinoma, and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma), but there were some increases and decreases in risk with reported use of individual supplements.

<h4 id="Mitochondrial">Mitochondrial DNA Copy Number</h4>
<p>High pre-diagnostic leukocyte mtDNA copy number, a suspected marker of oxidative DNA damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, was associated with increased future renal cell carcinoma risk among 252 cases and 504 controls in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. (Hofmann JN, Hosgood HD 3rd, Liu CS, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398668" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A nested case-control study of leukocyte mitochondrial DNA copy number and renal cell carcinoma in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial</a>. <i>Carcinogenesis</i> 2014;35:1028&ndash;1031)</p>

<h4 id="Diesel">Diesel Engine Exhaust</h4>
<p>Combined data from three U.S. occupational cohort studies suggest that levels of diesel engine exhaust&mdash;recently classified as a known human carcinogen and common in the workplace and in outdoor air&mdash;appear to pose substantial excess lifetime risks of lung cancer above the usually acceptable limits in the United States and Europe, which are generally set at 1/1,000 and 1/100,000 based on lifetime exposure for the occupational and general population, respectively. (Vermeulen R, Silverman DT, Garshick E, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24273233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Exposure-response estimates for diesel engine exhaust and lung cancer mortality based on data from three occupational cohorts</a>. <i>Environ Health Perspect</i> 2014;122:172&ndash;177)</p>
<h4 id="Telomere">Telomere Length</h4>
<p>Using prediagnostic specimens from three prospective cohort studies, longer telomere length was associated with increased lung cancer risk and was particularly evident for female adenocarcinoma cases. Telomere length in white blood cell DNA may be a biomarker of future increased risk of lung cancer.

<h4 id="HIV">HIV and Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma Subtypes</h4>
<p>Through a comparison of 51 HIV-infected and 116 HIV-uninfected diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cases diagnosed from 1977 to 2003, the authors found key differences in the molecular characteristics, cell of origin, and prognosis by HIV status in the pre&ndash;highly active antiretroviral therapy and pre-rituximab era, supporting biologic differences in lymphomagenesis in the presence of HIV. (Morton LM, Kim CJ, Weiss LM, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23772639" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Molecular characteristics of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma in human immunodeficiency virus-infected and -uninfected patients in the pre-highly active antiretroviral therapy and pre-rituximab era</a>. <i>Leuk Lymphoma</i> 2014;55:551&ndash;557)</p>
<h4 id="Marginal">Marginal Zone Lymphoma Incidence</h4>
<p>A comprehensive assessment of incidence patterns of marginal zone lymphoma by anatomic site in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) Program population-based registry data supports the contention that this malignancy is characterized by etiological heterogeneity across sites and that susceptibility is probably influenced by intrinsic characteristics and environmental exposures.

<h3 id="Melanoma">Melanoma</h3>
<h4 id="Melanoma-Susceptibility">Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>Using whole-exome sequencing, the authors identified a rare inherited mutation in the telomere shelterin gene <i>POT1</i> (chromosome 7, g.124493086C&gt;T; p.Ser270Asn) in five unrelated melanoma-prone families from Romagna, Italy. The authors also identified additional rare <i>POT1</i> variants in all cases sequenced in two separate Italian families, one variant per family, as well as two rare recurrent <i>POT1</i> variants in U.S. and French familial melanoma cases, suggesting that <i>POT1</i> is a major susceptibility gene for familial melanoma in several populations.

<h4 id="Leveraging">Leveraging Family History in Population-Based Case-Control Studies</h4>
<p>The authors propose a simple approach to primary genetic association testing in population-based epidemiologic studies that incorporates family history information as a &ldquo;phenotype&rdquo; and increases efficiency by as much as 40%, depending on the type of design used for conducting the primary study, extent of family history, and accuracy and completeness of reporting.

<p>Pooled data from 12 population-based case-control studies of ovarian cancer, comprising 7,776 case patients and 11,843 control subjects accrued between 1992 and 2007, showed that aspirin use was associated with a reduced risk of ovarian cancer, especially among daily users of low-dose aspirin, suggesting that the same aspirin regimen proven to protect against cardiovascular events and several cancers could reduce the risk of ovarian cancer 20% to 34% depending on frequency and dose of use.

<h4 id="Susceptibility-West-African">Genetic Susceptibility Among West African Men</h4>
<p>A genome-wide association study of prostate cancer among West African men found a promising association at 10p14 within an intron of a long non-coding RNA (lncRNA RP11-543F8.2) 360 kb centromeric of <i>GATA3</i> (<i>p</i> = 1.29 &times; 10<sup>-7</sup>), as well as single nucleotide polymorphisms at 5q31.3 associated with high Gleason score (&ge; 7) cancers.

<h4 id="Genetic-Variants-African">Genetic Variants Among Men of African Ancestry</h4>
<p>By resequencing a region on chromosome 8 containing several prostate cancer susceptibility loci, as well as a locus associated with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), among samples from men from Ghana and African Americans, 1,838 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were identified, including 285 novel SNPs that had not previously been reported in any public database. These findings could be important for establishing priorities for future functional work designed to explain the biological basis of associations between SNPs and both prostate cancer and CLL.

<h4 id="Variants-Vitamin-E">Genetic Variants Related to Vitamin E Status</h4>
<p>A study of variants in vitamin E&ndash;related genes among participants in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian &nbsp;Cancer Screening Trial suggests that polymorphisms near <i>BUD13</i>/<i>ZNF259</i>/<i>APOA5,</i> involved in vitamin E transport and metabolism, may be associated with lower risk of prostate cancer.

<h4 id="Screen-Prostate">Screen-Detected Prostate Cancer Among West African Men</h4>
<p>In a relatively unscreened population in Ghana, the authors conducted a population-based prostate cancer screening study with biopsy confirmation and found that screen-detected prostate cancer prevalence is high, suggesting a possible role of genetics in both prostate cancer etiology and the disparity in prostate cancer risk between African Americans and Caucasian Americans.

<h3 id="Testicular">Testicular Cancer</h3>
<h4 id="Analysis-Sex-Determination">Pathway-based Analysis of Sex Determination Genes</h4>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT) have identified 18 susceptibility loci containing genes that are important for male germ cell differentiation and maturation. One of these genes, <i>DMRT1</i>, plays crucial roles in male germ cell development and sex determination across the phylogenetic spectrum. The authors undertook pathway-based analyses of genes influencing sex determination to identify additional loci associated with the development of TGCT. They found evidence of a statistically significant association with a set of genes involved in sex determination, including <i>DMRT1</i>, with TGCT status in three independent TGCT GWAS datasets. Even after removing <i>DRMT1</i> from the sex determination gene set, there were strong indications of a statistically significant association with TGCT in the datasets. These results suggest that the pathway-based finding is not solely driven by the associations of <i>DMRT1</i> single nucleotide polymorphism markers and that variation in other genes included in this gene set are involved in the development of TGCT.

Abnet, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH. Dr. Abnet earned a Ph.D. in environmental toxicology from the University of Wisconsin in 1998 and an M.P.H. in epidemiology from the University of Minnesota in 1999. He joined NCI as a Cancer Prevention Fellow in the Division of Cancer Prevention in 1998. Dr. Abnet became a tenure-track investigator in the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch in 2005, and has served as one of four acting Branch Chiefs since 2011.</p>
<p>Dr. Abnet's work focuses on the etiology of esophageal and gastric cancer and the lifestyle, environmental, and genetic contributions to the development of these diseases. He is interested in the differing incidence and etiologic factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, across diverse populations that share high rates of these two malignancies. He currently leads studies in China, Iran, and Kenya to carry out this work. Furthermore, Dr. Abnet&nbsp;is participating in an International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) working group on &ldquo;<i>Helicobacter pylori</i> eradication as a strategy for preventing gastric cancer."</p>
<p>Dr. Abnet&rsquo;s work also explores the microbiome and its associations with cancer, as well as risk factors that may affect oral health and its potential association with disease. For example, using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), he is conducting one of the first studies aiming to characterize the effects of tobacco on the oral microbiome within a nationally-representative study population, with his co-investigators <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=23&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349667" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349667" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260503" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349667">Anil Chaturvedi, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349608" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349608" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260504" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349608">Neal Freedman, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a> This work is funded via a competitive grant process, though a collaboration between the Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products and the NIH.</p>
<p>Dr. Abnet is also the recipient of numerous awards, including the NCI Director's Intramural Innovation Award (2006 and 2009), DCEG Intramural Research Award (2006), NIH Merit Award (2008), DCEG Outstanding Mentor Award (2009), as well as a Research Highlights Award lecture, which he presented at the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1955&amp;sys_contentid=409832" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="409832" sys_dependentvariantid="1955" sys_relationshipid="7260502" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1955" sys_contentid="409832">2011 NCI Intramural Scientific Retreat</a>.</p>

<p>In March, DCEG investigators participated in a workshop titled &ldquo;Measuring Estrogen Exposure and Metabolism,&rdquo; held in Bethesda, Maryland. The workshop provided an opportunity for experts to discuss how to improve and standardize methods for assessing estrogen exposure and metabolism in both epidemiologic and clinical research. A major focus was the need for improved methods for breast cancer research, prevention, and treatment. The workshop closed with the development of guiding principles for future research directions and clinical guidelines; summaries and conclusions will be published in the <i>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</i>. Individual presentations will be published in the journal <i>Steroids</i>.</p>
<p><a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/ziegler-regina">Regina G. Ziegler, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, co-chaired the workshop along with Dr. Laurence M.

<p>Nearly 350 scientists attended the symposium, titled <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=19&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=884839" sys_contentid="884839" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7264376" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="884839" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418">&ldquo;Cancer Epidemiology: From Pedigrees to Populations,&rdquo;</a> which focused on a selection of some of the major scientific themes that flourished and expanded out of Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s groundbreaking research into cancer etiology and prevention. In addition, many of Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s closest friends and family were present at the event.</p>
<p>Dr. Fraumeni stepped down as DCEG Director in July 2012, but continues to serve as a senior investigator and advisor at NCI and NIH. Prior to the symposium, NCI Director Harold E. Varmus, M.D., honored Dr. Fraumeni by revealing a commemorative plaque formally designating Shady Grove Room TE-406 as the &ldquo;Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D., Conference Room.&rdquo;</p>

Chanock, M.D.</a>, Director of DCEG, provided opening remarks and welcomed symposium speakers, honored guests, and attendees. He gave an overview of Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s legacy and impact on the cancer research community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Over the past 50 years, cancer research has benefited from Joe seizing opportunities to bring about so many remarkable discoveries,&rdquo; Dr. Chanock said. &ldquo;His career truly exemplifies what Louis Pasteur remarked: 'In the fields of observation, chance favors only the prepared mind'.&nbsp;We are fortunate that he continues to be an essential contributor to DCEG, offering an extraordinary intellect, and more importantly, wisdom for our Division and the field of cancer epidemiology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The symposium was organized into three major sessions, during which Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s colleagues and collaborators highlighted critical findings made over the past 50 years. The speakers also discussed opportunities for future research with the potential to significantly advance our understanding of the causes of cancer. In addition, speakers shared their personal stories about Dr. Fraumeni, all noting his support for scientific collaboration, generosity with his time, and wise counsel.</p>
<p><img class="right" alt="" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=7&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=789620" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7264379" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="789620" rxinlineslot="104" />The first session, &ldquo;Search for Cancer Susceptibility Genes,&rdquo; was moderated by Dr. David Schottenfeld, University of Michigan. Drs. Schottenfeld and Fraumeni have co-edited several editions of the definitive textbook, <i>Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention</i>. The first speaker, Dr. Louise C. Strong, University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, recounted Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s discovery in 1969 with fellow NCI researcher Dr. Frederick P. Li of a rare, inherited, multicancer syndrome. The syndrome, which manifested by a striking constellation of multiple cancers in children and young adults, is now known as Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Dr. David Malkin, The Hospital for Sick Children, described how this observation eventually led to collaborative molecular studies that uncovered inherited mutations in the <i>p53</i> tumor suppressor gene. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=43&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349621" sys_contentid="349621" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7264380" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349621" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965">Sharon A. Savage, M.D.</a>, Chief of the Clinical Genetics Branch, examined how Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s early family studies laid the groundwork for current studies of cancer etiology and telomere biology. Dr. Kenneth Offit, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, discussed how germline cancer genetics informs tumor genetics and current generation approaches to understanding cancer susceptibility syndromes.</p>
<p>The second session, &ldquo;High-risk Populations and Insights into Carcinogenic Mechanisms,&rdquo; was moderated by Dr. Margaret R. Spitz, Baylor College of Medicine. Dr. Spitz also serves as a special advisor to DCEG. During this session, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=22&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349601" sys_contentid="349601" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7264381" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349601" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965">Eric A. Engels, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, offered a review of past and current research on transplant-associated immunosuppression and cancer, including Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s early epidemiologic studies of cancer in transplant recipients. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349664" sys_contentid="349664" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7264382" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349664" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965">Robert N. Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.</a>, Director of the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, discussed hormonal carcinogenesis across the life course, particularly focusing on early-life events that might initiate carcinogenesis.</p>
<p><img class="left" alt="" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=789619" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7264383" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="789619" rxinlineslot="104" />The final section session, &ldquo;Global Health: Opportunities for Epidemiologic Research,&rdquo; was moderated by Dr. Brian E. Henderson, University of Southern California, whose friendship with Dr. Fraumeni dates back to their collaboration on epidemiologic studies in China in the 1980s. Starting the session, Dr. William J. Blot, International Epidemiology Institute &amp; Vanderbilt University, and a former Branch Chief at NCI, described Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s role in developing the first U.S. cancer maps, which were soon followed by similar atlases from other countries. The maps identified geographic cancer hot spots and allowed Dr. Fraumeni and his colleagues to identify environmental exposures driving the distinctive patterns of certain malignancies and also to target high-risk regions for cancer prevention and control measures. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349644" sys_contentid="349644" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7264384" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349644" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965">Nathaniel Rothman, M.D., M.P.H., M.H.S.</a>, reviewed the Division&rsquo;s long history of epidemiologic research on lung cancer and indoor air pollution in China. Finally, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=50&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349612" sys_contentid="349612" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7264385" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349612" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965">Christian C. Abnet, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, discussed Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s legacy of interventional and etiologic studies of esophageal and gastric cancer, as well as current research in China, Brazil, and Iran.</p>
<p>The symposium concluded with statements by Dr. Michael Thun, American Cancer Society, and Michael Gottesman, M.D., NIH Deputy Director for Intramural Research. In addition, Dr. Varmus offered final remarks on Dr. Fraumeni&rsquo;s remarkable 50-year legacy in the field of cancer epidemiology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Epidemiology is connected to everything,&rdquo; Dr. Varmus said. &ldquo;We heard today about clinical science, about global health, about environmental health, about mechanisms of disease, about counting what's there so [we] can study it&hellip;Almost all provocative questions begin with some epidemiological observation. I want to thank all of you for coming today to celebrate not only Joe as an NIH hero, but epidemiology as a remarkable underpinning and cohesive effort throughout the realm of cancer research.&rdquo;</p>

Mentoring has also played a vital role in shaping his career; a particularly good secondary school teacher encouraged his early interest in science. &#8220;I remember that the genetics revolution was under way and the Human Genome Project had begun; it was all very exciting,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I decided then and there that I was going to study biology and preferably human genetics.&#8221;</p><p>After earning a bachelor&#8217;s degree in genetics from the University of Nottingham in England, Dr. Cook knew that he wanted to continue in the field. &#8220;The natural counterpart to genetics is epidemiology,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I wanted to apply the tools and concepts I had learned while studying genetics to understand disease in human populations.&#8221;</p><p>Dr. Cook next pursued a Ph.D. in molecular epidemiology from the University of Leeds in England, where he started looking at sex differences in the pathogenesis of esophageal adenocarcinoma. His mentors encouraged his desire to look abroad for postdoctoral positions, and he eventually applied to DCEG and accepted a position within HREB.</p><p>Upon arriving at DCEG as a postdoctoral fellow in 2007, Dr. Cook started working with <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_revision=8&amp;sys_contentid=349637&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349637" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4569604" sys_siteid="475">Katherine A. McGlynn, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, Deputy Chief of HREB, in the area of testicular cancer, particularly focusing on the U.S. Servicemen&#8217;s Testicular Tumor Environmental and Endocrine Determinants (STEED) study. He also became heavily involved with the <a href="http://beacon.tlvnet.net/" target="_blank">International Barrett&#8217;s and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON)</a> and in studies with now-former DCEG investigator Dr. Wong-Ho Chow, thanks in part to a post-Thanksgiving dinner conversation with <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_revision=7&amp;sys_contentid=349670&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349670" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4569605" sys_siteid="475">Sanford M. Dawsey, M.D.</a></p><p>&#8220;After introducing me to bacon-wrapped turkey, Sandy took me for a walk and asked me what else I was interested in working on in addition to my studies with Dr. McGlynn,&#8221; Dr. Cook said. &#8220;We discussed my prior work on esophageal adenocarcinoma, and he said he must introduce me to Wong-Ho Chow, who subsequently gave me some great opportunities in esophageal cancer research. Sandy played an important role in starting that collaboration at an early stage in my DCEG career.&#8221;</p><p>Dr. Cook was promoted to a research fellow in 2008 and to a tenure-track investigator in 2011. During the past several years his research portfolio has diversified; he still spends much of his time working on esophageal adenocarcinoma, but he is now focused on prostate cancer as well.</p><h3>Esophageal Adenocarcinoma: Sex Differences and Obesity</h3><p>Dr. Cook uses both classical and molecular epidemiologic approaches in his attempts to understand why as many as seven men for every one woman develop esophageal adenocarcinoma. &#8220;No one has been able to explain why such a large sex disparity exists with this malignancy,&#8221; he said.</p><p>One long-standing theory is that sex steroid hormones, such as androgens, estrogens, and their derivatives, might play a role. Dr. Cook and colleagues are currently investigating whether different levels of sex steroid hormones within men contribute to altered risks of esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett esophagus, the metaplasia that precedes cancer. In addition, they are pursuing other hypotheses, including the possibility that both inflammatory cytokines and metabolic syndrome affect risk. Each of these factors shares associations with both sex and body mass index.</p><p>&#8220;Obesity is the central theme of my esophageal adenocarcinoma research,&#8221; Dr. Cook said. &#8220;Obesity is strongly associated with this malignancy, and adipose tissue is a major site of sex steroid hormone metabolism.&#8221;</p><p>Accurate risk prediction for esophageal adenocarcinoma is also needed. Most individuals are diagnosed with a late-stage malignancy, resulting in a five-year survival rate of less than 20 percent. Dr. Cook is currently assessing whether circulating microRNAs and inflammatory markers in blood can be used to differentiate between esophageal adenocarcinoma and Barrett esophagus, with the eventual goal of enhancing carcinogenic risk prediction in those with Barrett esophagus, as well as detection in those with early-stage malignancy.</p><h3>Prostate Cancer: Hormonal and Genetic Mechanisms</h3><p>Dr. Cook&#8217;s interest in prostate cancer includes the interplay of hormones and genetics, with continued aims of elucidating pathogenesis and increasing our ability to predict risk.</p><p>&#8220;Although most analyses of hormones and prostate cancer have not provided evidence for an association, most of these have focused on &#8216;parent&#8217; hormones alone,&#8221; he said. Dr. Cook, Amanda Black, Ph.D., M.P.H., and colleagues are currently analyzing the role of estrogen metabolites, as well as the estrogen-androgen balance, in relation to aggressive prostate cancer within the <a href="http://prevention.cancer.gov/plco/eems" target="_blank">Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial</a>.</p><p>One problem with current approaches to hormonal exposure and prostate cancer is that hormones are typically quantified at only a single point. &#8220;Because of the barriers to assessing at multiple time points, we are also looking at phenotypic markers that are proxies of long-term hormone status, including male pattern baldness and adolescent and adult height,&#8221; Dr. Cook said.</p><p>In addition, Dr. Cook is investigating germline and somatic genetics of prostate cancer, and he is assessing how this may overlap with hormonal factors that may be associated with carcinogenic risk. &#8220;We are currently establishing a pilot study of somatic genetics within the Ghana Prostate Cancer Study,&#8221; said Dr. Cook. &#8220;This work is in line with my background in genetics, and the study provides a unique population in which we can conduct cutting-edge research.&#8221;</p><h3>Mentoring for Success</h3><div class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" contenteditable="false" inlinetype="rxvariant" rxinlineslot="105" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentid="790155" sys_dependentvariantid="2066" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4569607" sys_siteid="475"><figure class="image-right-medium" rxanchortext=""><img alt="" contenteditable="false" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=790155&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_folderid=784841&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_command=edit" unselectable="on" /><!--Comment--> <figcaption contenteditable="false" unselectable="on"><div class="caption-container" contenteditable="false" unselectable="on"><p contenteditable="false" unselectable="on">Michael Cook receives the DCEG Outstanding Mentor Award from Stephen Chanock.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p>When discussing his various research pursuits, Dr. Cook often highlights the pivotal role that certain individuals, mentors, and collaborators have played each step of the way.</p><p>&#8220;The mentorship I have received at DCEG has been outstanding,&#8221; Dr. Cook said. &#8220;Especially from Katherine; she understands when to advise and when to let you spread your wings, paving the path for independence.&#8221;</p><p>Dr. Cook is now a mentor himself and credits Dr. McGlynn with teaching him mentoring skills and giving him opportunities to practice. &#8220;After a couple of years in DCEG, Katherine enabled me to co-mentor three successive summer students,&#8221; he said. &#8220;That was a great learning experience, and I&#8217;m really proud that each of my students ended up with a first-author manuscript.&#8221;</p><p>When asked about his most significant achievement to date, Dr. Cook immediately pointed to the DCEG Outstanding Mentor Award hanging on the wall of his office. Each year, the award is bestowed by DCEG fellows. Dr. Cook was nominated by HREB postdoctoral fellow <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_revision=49&amp;sys_contentid=302456&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475#Drahos" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302456" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4569606" sys_siteid="475">Jennifer Drahos, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, and was subsequently selected for the honor in early 2014.</p><p>&#8220;Without a doubt, the mentoring award means a great deal to me,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Every day I&#8217;m motivated to help my fellows find success and achieve their goals.&#8221;</p><p><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1426&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=784834&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="784834" sys_dependentvariantid="1426" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4569609" sys_siteid="475">Back to the summer 2014 issue of <i>Linkage</i> newsletter</a></p></div>]]></body>

If neither occurs, the cell can continue to divide despite having critically short telomeres, which can lead to genetic instability and chromosomal abnormalities that can lead to cancer.</p><div class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" contenteditable="false" inlinetype="rxvariant" rxinlineslot="105" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentid="792759" sys_dependentvariantid="2082" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4569597" sys_siteid="475"><figure class="image-center" rxanchortext=""><img alt="" contenteditable="false" longdesc="/http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=792759&amp;sys_revision=3&amp;sys_folderid=784835&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=2068&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_command=edit" src="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=792759&amp;sys_revision=3&amp;sys_folderid=784835&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_command=edit" unselectable="on" /><!-- Comment --> <figcaption contenteditable="false" unselectable="on"><div class="caption-container" contenteditable="false" unselectable="on"><p contenteditable="false" unselectable="on">DCEG scientists combine clinical, laboratory, and epidemiological expertise to learn about defects in telomere biology that cause inherited bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition syndromes, such as dyskeratosis congenita.</p></div></figcaption></figure></div><p>&#160;</p><h3>Dyskeratosis Congenita</h3><p>Mutations in the genes responsible for telomere maintenance have been found in subsets of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes, acute myeloid leukemia, severe aplastic anemia, and some other conditions. Dr. Savage&#8217;s work has focused on <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_revision=7&amp;sys_contentid=335952&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="335952" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4569590" sys_siteid="475">dyskeratosis congenita (DC)</a>, a cancer-prone inherited bone marrow failure syndrome. Through family-based genetic linkage studies and recent exome sequencing studies, Dr. Savage and colleagues have identified three genes in which mutations cause DC: <i>TINF2</i> (a gene in the shelterin telomere protection complex), <i>WRAP53</i> (also known as <i>TCAB1</i>, a gene related to telomerase localization), and <i>RTEL1</i> (a gene that regulates telomere length). Germline mutations in these genes plus six others associated with telomere maintenance (<i>CTC1</i>, <i>DKC1</i>, <i>NOP10</i>, <i>NHP2</i>, <i>TERC</i>, and <i>TERT</i>) are present in approximately 70 percent of DC patients.</p><p>DCEG investigators are continuing their efforts to identify additional genes that might be responsible for DC in patients without mutations in any of the nine known genes. Moving from the clinic to the population genetics setting, the investigators also have evaluated the frequency of a particular mutation in <i>RTEL1</i> that causes Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, a clinically severe variant of DC among Ashkenazi Jews. The mutation has been found at a high-enough frequency to recommend its inclusion in the genetic screening panels for the Ashkenazi population.</p><p><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_revision=5&amp;sys_contentid=349651&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349651" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4569591" sys_siteid="475">Blanche P. Alter, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, initiated the cohort study of patients and family members with cancer-prone inherited bone marrow failure syndromes in which the DC research has been conducted. She led an effort to use the knowledge that DC patients have extremely short telomeres (below the first percentile for age) to develop a diagnostic test for DC using automated flow-FISH (fluorescent <i>in-situ</i> hybridization) in collaboration with Dr. Peter M. Lansdorp of the British Columbia Cancer Agency. By analyzing telomere length in white blood cells, this test can confirm the diagnosis of DC, distinguish patients with DC from unaffected family members, identify clinically silent DC carriers, and discriminate between patients with DC and those with other bone marrow failure disorders.</p><h3>Telomere Biology</h3><p>Patients with DC are at high risk from complications after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT), possibly because of their germline defects in telomere biology. <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_revision=6&amp;sys_contentid=349606&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349606" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4569592" sys_siteid="475">Shahinaz Gadalla, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, is investigating the association between telomere length and HSCT outcomes in patients with acquired severe aplastic anemia (SAA).

Also, sporadic melanoma cases (cases occurring outside melanoma-prone families) had significant overall genetic burden due to rare variants in <i>POT1</i> when compared with healthy controls. Together with the <i>TERT</i> promoter variant previously identified in familial melanoma, the investigators&#8217; findings suggest that genes involved in telomere maintenance may serve important roles in melanoma development.</p><p>Researchers across DCEG have been evaluating telomere length in relation to the risk of other cancers among members of the general population (i.e., people not in cancer-prone families). The strongest evidence for an association with short telomeres is for bladder, esophageal, gastric, and renal cancers, types of cancer that are linked to smoking and inflammation. To date, the results for other cancers have been inconsistent or null.</p><h3>Telomere Molecular Epidemiology</h3><p>The studies of telomeres and cancer among the general population could be affected by methodological issues, including whether the samples were collected after cancer diagnosis or treatment instead of prior to development of the disease, the use of surrogate tissues instead of the actual cancer cells, the laboratory technique used to measure length, variability in other cancer risk factors, and other issues.

<p>Over the past 14 years, researchers in the Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), led by Branch Chief <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=43&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349621" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349621" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260520" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349621">Sharon Savage, M.D.</a>, have carried out a study of dyskeratosis congenita (DC) at the NIH Clinical Center to better understand the disorder and to identify the genes responsible for it.</p>
<p>DC is a rare inherited bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition syndrome caused by aberrant <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302581" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302581" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7260521" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302581">telomere biology</a>. Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that are essential for maintaining chromosomal integrity. DC is often diagnosed in early childhood but individuals can develop features of DC at any age. Families who have one child with DC are at high risk for having future children with the disorder.</p>
<p>Using exome sequencing, Dr. Savage and her team have identified several genes that cause DC, including <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24009516" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><i>RTEL1</i></a>, a gene known to be involved in telomere biology. Discovery of a rare founder mutation in this gene has led to a direct benefit for at least one DC family. The story has been covered in the popular press. <a href="https://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/family-who-lost-daughter-to-rare-genetic-disease-has-healthy-baby-with-nih-s-help-175955374.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Read more about it here</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Next generation platforms for genetic studies have accelerated our progress and allowed us to identify additional DC genes in record time,&rdquo; Dr. Savage said. &ldquo;This family&rsquo;s triumph was the result of successful exome sequencing studies. It&rsquo;s truly gratifying to hear of such a success story.&rdquo;</p>

<h4 id="Extreme-Obesity">Obesity and All-Cause Mortality</h4>
<p>Adults with extreme obesity have increased risks of dying at a younger age from cancer and many other causes including heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and kidney and liver diseases, according to a pooled analysis of data from 20 large studies. Risks rose continuously with increasing body mass index (BMI) within the class III obesity group (BMI of 40-59 kg/m<sup>2</sup>), with years of life lost ranging from 6.5 years for participants with a BMI of 40-44.9 to 13.7 years for a BMI of 55-59.9. (Kitahara CM, Flint AJ, Berrington de Gonzalez A, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25003901">Association between class III obesity (BMI of 40-59 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) and mortality: A pooled analysis of 20 prospective studies</a>. <i>PLOS Medicine</i> 2014;11:e1001673). <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=7&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1424&amp;sys_contentid=801830" sys_contentid="801830" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="801830" sys_dependentvariantid="1424" sys_relationshipid="7277668" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1424">Read more about obesity and mortality risk</a>.</p>

<h4 id="Markers-Aggressive-Disease">Genetic Markers for Aggressive Disease</h4>
<p>Through fine-mapping of a genetic marker for bladder cancer within the 19q12 region located upstream of the <i>CCNE1</i> gene, along with functional studies, the investigators identified a functional promoter variant, rs7257330, as the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) signal for aggressive bladder cancer. (Fu YP, Kohaar I, Moore LE, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25320178">The 19q12 bladder cancer GWAS signal: Association with cyclin E function and aggressive disease</a>. <i>Cancer Res</i> 2014;74:5808-5818). <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1424&amp;sys_contentid=841024" sys_contentid="841024" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="841024" sys_dependentvariantid="1424" sys_relationshipid="7277672" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1424">Read more about the genetic marker identified for aggressive bladder cancer</a>.</p>

<h4 id="Childhood-Height">Childhood Height and Weight</h4>
<p>In a prospective evaluation linking data from the Copenhagen School Health Records Register, the Danish Cancer Registry, and other national registries, the investigators found that exposures associated with higher birth weight and, in boys, greater height during childhood may contribute to the etiology of adult glioma.(Kitahara CM, Gamborg M, Rajaraman P, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25205831">A prospective study of height and body mass index in childhood, birth weight, and risk of adult glioma over 40 years of follow-up.</a> <i>Am J Epidemiol</i> 2014;180:821-829)</p>
<h3 id="Breast">Breast Cancer</h3>
<h4 id="Alcohol">Alcohol</h4>
<p>The effects of alcohol consumption, an established risk factor for breast cancer, were found to vary by tumor characteristics with positive associations limited to ER+/PR+ tumors, and within this subgroup, risks were observed for ductal and mixed ductal/lobular cancers. Analyses incorporating multiple tumor characteristics indicated that PR status, and not necessarily ER status, may characterize alcohol-associated etiological heterogeneity for breast cancer subtypes. (Falk RT, Maas P, Schairer C, et al.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25150269">Alcohol and risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women: An analysis of etiological heterogeneity by multiple tumor characteristics</a>.&nbsp;<i>Am J Epidemiol</i> 2014;180:705-717)</p>
<h4 id="Bisphenol-A">Bisphenol A</h4>
<p id="Bisphenol-A">In a large population-based case-control study of breast cancer conducted in Poland, there was no association between the major urinary bisphenol A (BPA) metabolite [BPA-glucuronide (BPA-G)] measured at the time of diagnosis and postmenopausal breast cancer risk (Trabert B, Falk RT, Figueroa JD, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25189422">Urinary bisphenol A-glucuronide and postmenopausal breast cancer in Poland.</a> <i>Cancer Causes Control</i> 2014;25:1587-1593)</p>
<h4 id="Heterogeneous-Effects">Detecting Genetic Variants with Heterogeneous Effects</h4>
<p>The investigators propose a robust statistical procedure to identify genetic risk factors that have either a uniform effect for all disease subtypes or heterogeneous effects across different subtypes, in situations where the subtypes are not predefined but can be characterized roughly by a set of clinical and/or pathologic markers. They demonstrate the advantage of the new procedure through numeric simulation studies and an application to a breast cancer study. (Yu K, Zhang H, Wheeler W, et al.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25057183">A robust association test for detecting genetic variants with heterogeneous effects</a>. <i>Biostatistics</i> 2014; E-pub July 23)</p>
<h4 id="Fertility">Fertility Treatment</h4>
<p>Norwegian women exposed to assisted reproductive technology, which involves hormonal exposures, had an elevated risk of breast cancer (hazard ratio [HR] 1.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.01-1.42), with HRs of 1.30 (CI 1.07-1.57) for women treated with <i>in vitro</i> fertilization and 1.35 (CI 1.07-1.71) for women with follow-up &gt;10 years, compared with controls. Continued monitoring of women treated with assisted reproductive technology is warranted as this population advances into more typical cancer age ranges. (Reigstad MM, Larsen IK, Myklebust TA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25042052">Risk of breast cancer following fertility treatment-A registry based cohort study of parous women in Norway</a>. <i>Int J Cancer</i> 2014; E-pub July 9)</p>
<h4 id="TDLU-Involution">Terminal Duct Lobular Unit Involution</h4>
<p>Using normal tissues donated by volunteers, the investigators show that age, menopausal status, and parity are critical determinants of breast terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) involution, which has been linked to lower breast cancer risk.&nbsp;Morphometric analysis of TDLU involution warrants further evaluation to understand the pathogenesis of breast cancer and assessing its role as a progression marker for women with benign biopsies or as an intermediate endpoint in prevention studies. (Figueroa JD, Pfeiffer RM, Patel DA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25274491">Terminal duct lobular unit involution of the normal breast: Implications for breast cancer etiology</a>. <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2014;106: E-pub October 1)</p>

<h4 id="Acquired-Immunity">Acquired Immunity Against Reinfection</h4>
<p>An investigation of the association between enrollment human papillomavirus (HPV) serostatus and risk of type-specific HPV reinfection and incident cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2+ over a two-year follow-up period in the Atypical Squamous Cells of Undetermined Significance/Low-Grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion Triage Study (ALTS) found that seroprevalence conferred protection against subsequent HPV infection for HPV 16 and indicated possible protection for HPV 18 and 31, suggesting that this effect is common to several HPV genotypes. (Wilson L, Pawlita M, Castle PE, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24569064">Seroprevalence of 8 oncogenic human papillomavirus genotypes and acquired immunity against reinfection</a>. <i>J Infect Dis</i> 2014;210:448&ndash;455)</p>
<h4>Human Papillomavirus Genotyping for Cervical Cancer Risk Stratification</h4>
<p>Evaluation of the three-year cumulative risk of cervical precancer among women with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive, cytology-negative screening results showed that knowing HPV 16 status conferred the greatest type-specific risk stratification; HPV 16-positive women had a 10.6% risk of precancer while HPV 16-negative women had risk of 2.4%. HPV16 genotyping provides risk stratification useful to guide management; the risk among HPV16-positive women clearly exceeds the US consensus "risk threshold" for immediate colposcopy referral. HPV18 is of particular interest because of its association with difficult-to-detect glandular lesions. The investigators concluded that the clinical value of distinguishing the other high-risk HPV types is less clear. (Schiffman M, Burk RD, Boyle S, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25339396">A study of genotyping for the management of human papillomavirus-positive, cytology-negative cervical screening results</a>. <i>J Clin Microbiol</i> 2015;53:52-59<b>)</b></p>
<h4 id="HPV-Testing">Human Papillomavirus Testing</h4>
<p>Using data from over one million women who underwent routine cervical cancer screening at Kaiser Permanente Northern California, the authors found that primary human papillomavirus (HPV) testing every three years might provide as much, if not more, reassurance against precancer and cancer, compared to primary Pap testing every three years and cotesting every five years. These findings suggest that primary HPV testing merits consideration as another alternative for cervical screening. (Gage JC, Schiffman M, Katki HA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038467">Reassurance against future risk of precancer and cancer conferred by a negative human papillomavirus test</a>. <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2014; E-pub July 18). <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=18&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1424&amp;sys_contentid=805103" sys_contentid="805103" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="805103" sys_dependentvariantid="1424" sys_relationshipid="7277673" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1424">Read more about HPV testing and future risk of precancer and cancer</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Urine-HPV-Detection">Novel Urine-based HPV Detection Assay</h4>
<p>In a pilot study among 72 women referred to colposcopy following abnormal cervical cancer screening, the authors found that the prototype Trovagene human papillomavirus (HPV) test, a novel polymerase chain reaction assay that targets the E1 region of the HPV genome and detects and amplifies short fragments of cell-free HPV DNA, had high sensitivity for urine-based detection of cervical precancer and merits evaluation in larger studies. (Sahasrabuddhe VV, Gravitt PE, Dunn ST, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24881489">Evaluation of clinical performance of a novel urine-based HPV detection assay among women attending a colposcopy clinic</a>. <i>J Clin Virol</i> 2014;60:414&ndash;417)</p>

<h4 id="T-Variants-Duplication"><i>T</i> Gene Sequence Variants and Germline Duplications</h4>
<p>After previously identifying germline <i>T</i> duplication as a major susceptibility mechanism in several chordoma families, the authors measured <i>T</i> copy number variants and sequenced all <i>T</i> exons in familial cases, unaffected family members, sporadic cases, and unrelated controls, and identified a second common variant, rs1056048, that was strongly associated with chordoma in families and another common variant, rs3816300, that was associated with sporadic cases, particularly those with early age at onset. (Kelley MJ, Shi J, Ballew B, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24990759">Characterization of <i>T</i> gene sequence variants and germline duplications in familial and sporadic chordoma</a>. <i>Hum Genet</i> 2014;133:1289-1297)</p>

<h4 id="Tobacco-Colorectal">Tobacco</h4>
<p>In a nested case-control study of 255 colorectal cancers and 254 matched controls identified in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial, baseline serum was used to identify metabolites that represent smoking habits and individual variation in tobacco metabolism. The biomarkers exhibited stronger associations with colorectal cancer than self-reported smoking histories, which are subject to misclassification, providing additional evidence for a role for tobacco in this malignancy. (Cross AJ, Boca S, Freedman ND, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24648381">Metabolites of tobacco smoking and colorectal cancer risk</a>. <i>Carcinogenesis</i> 2014;35:1516&ndash;1522)</p>

<h3 id="Endometrial">Endometrial Cancer</h3>
<h4 id="Endometrial-Genetic-Susceptibility">Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>The authors examined 213 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) previously associated with 14 other cancers for their associations with endometrial cancer in 3,758 endometrial cancer cases and 5,966 controls of European ancestry from two consortia: Population Architecture Using Genomics and Epidemiology and the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium. SNP rs7679673, ~6.3kb upstream of <i>TET2</i> and previously reported to be associated with prostate cancer risk, was associated with endometrial cancer risk in the direction opposite to that for prostate cancer. (Setiawan VW, Schumacher F, Prescott J, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24832084">Cross-cancer pleiotropic analysis of endometrial cancer: PAGE and E2C2 consortia</a>. <i>Carcinogenesis</i> 2014;35:2068&ndash;2073)</p>
<h4 id="Intrauterine-Devices">Intrauterine Devices</h4>
<p>In a pooled analysis of data on approximately 9,000 cases and 15,000 controls in the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium, the investigators found that ever use of intrauterine devices was inversely related to risk, older age at first use, older age at last use, longer duration of use, and recent use.&nbsp;Future studies are needed to assess the respective roles of detection biases and biologic effects related to foreign body responses in the endometrium, heavier bleeding (and increased clearance of carcinogenic cells) and localized hormonal changes. (Felix AS, Gaudet MM, Vecchia CL, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25242594">Intrauterine devices and endometrial cancer risk: A pooled analysis of the Epidemiology of Endometrial Cancer Consortium</a>. <i>Int J Cancer</i> 2014; E-pub September 20)</p>
<h4 id="Methylation">Methylation</h4>
<p>The investigators performed DNA methylation profiling on population-based endometrial cancers to identify early detection biomarkers and replicated top candidates in two independent studies. They identified eight genes (<i>ADCYAP1, ASCL2, HS3ST2, HTR1B, MME, NPY and SOX1</i>) associated with odds ratios ranging from 3.44 for <i>ASCL2</i> to 18.61 for <i>HTR1B</i>. An area under the curve of 0.93 was achieved for discriminating carcinoma from benign endometrium. Methylation markers may be used to evaluate women with abnormal vaginal bleeding to distinguish women with endometrial carcinoma from the majority of women without malignancy.

<h4 id="Gastroesophageal Reflux">Gastroesophageal Reflux</h4>
<p>A study conducted in the Barrett&rsquo;s and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) indicates that the association between heartburn/regurgitation symptoms and esophageal adenocarcinoma is strong, increases with increased duration and/or frequency, and is consistent across major risk factors. Weaker associations for esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma suggest that this cancer site has a dissimilar pathogenesis or represents a mixed population of patients.

<h4 id="Nasal-Chondromesenchymal-Hamartoma">Nasal Chondromesenchymal Hamartoma</h4>
<p>Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartoma (NCMH) is a rare nasal tumor that typically presents in young children. The authors previously reported on NCMH occurrence in children with pleuropulmonary blastoma (PPB), a rare pulmonary dysembryonic sarcoma that is the hallmark neoplasm in the PPB-associated <i>DICER1</i> tumor predisposition disorder. In this paper, the authors expand on their prior report of four PPB patients who have developed NCMH to nine, and provide evidence that the genetic pathogenesis of this benign tumor mirrors that of PPB (Stewart DR, Messinger Y, Williams GM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25118636">Nasal chondromesenchymal hamartomas arise secondary to germline and somatic mutations of DICER1 in the pleuropulmonary blastoma tumor predisposition disorder</a>. <b><i>&nbsp;</i></b><i>Hum Genet</i> 2014; 133:1443-1450)</p>
<h4 id="Neurofibromatosis-Type-1">Neurofibromatosis Type 1</h4>
<p>In a set of 79 individuals with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), two correlated, common SNPs (rs4660761 and rs7161) between <i>DPH2</i> and <i>ATP6V0B</i> were significantly associated with the caf&eacute;-au-lait macule (CALM) count, a tractable, tumor-like phenotype in NF1. Both SNPs were highly significant in a mega-analysis in a combined cohort of 180 self-reported European-Americans; SNP rs1800934 <i>(MSH6)</i> was near-significant in a meta-analysis assuming dominant effect of the minor allele. SNP rs4660761 is predicted to regulate <i>ATP6V0B</i>, a gene associated with melanosome biology. Individuals with homozygous mutations in <i>MSH6</i> can develop an NF1-like phenotype, including multiple CALMs. (Pemov A, Sung H, Hyland PL, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329635">Genetic modifiers of neurofibromatosis type 1-associated caf&eacute;-au-lait macule count identified using multi-platform analysis</a>. <i>PLoS Genet</i> 2014;10(10):e1004575</p>

<h4 id="Vitamin-D">Vitamin D-Binding Protein</h4>
<p>A nested case-control analysis within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study observed that men with higher serum concentrations of vitamin D-binding protein (DBP) experienced lower risk of renal cell carcinoma, whereas the molar ratio of circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] to DBP, a proxy for free circulating 25(OH)D, showed a possible positive risk association. Combined, the two findings suggest that the DBP association may reflect a biological mechanism unrelated to vitamin D status. The relationship of circulating bound and free 25(OH)D and DBP with tissue-level availability of 25(OH)D also warrants examination, and may help elucidate some of the conflicting results observed in epidemiologic studies of vitamin D and cancer.

<p>Investigators conducted the first study among people with type II diabetes to evaluate the association of anti-diabetic medications and liver cancer using a comparator group of non-users of any anti-diabetic drugs. Anti-diabetic medications were not associated with liver cancer, though there was a suggestion of a small protective effect for metformin.

<p>Investigators have found that lung cancer risk increases with shorter time to first cigarette after waking (TTFC), a single-item measure of nicotine dependency. TTFC improved lung cancer risk stratification beyond standard smoking measures, such as intensity, duration, and pack-years, which suggests that TTFC may be useful in lung cancer screening and smoking cessation programs.

<h4 id="Etiologic-Heterogeneity">Etiologic Heterogeneity</h4>
<p>In a large international collaborative analysis of risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), based on over 17,000 cases and 23,000 controls, investigators were able to quantify risk associated with medical history, lifestyle factors, family history of blood or lymph-borne cancers, and occupation for 11 different NHL subtypes, including less common subtypes. They identified risk factors that were common among subtypes as well as risk factors that appeared to be distinct among individual or a few subtypes, suggesting both subtype-specific and shared underlying mechanisms.

<h4 id="GB-Virus">GB Virus-C and Risk of non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</h4>
<p>Data from the PLCO Study showed that prediagnostic serum levels of GB virus-C (GBV-C) (formerly known as hepatitis G virus) RNA were associated with risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma overall and, based on small numbers, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.&nbsp; GBV-C infection may play an etiologic role in a small proportion of NHL cases, perhaps by causing chronic immune stimulation or impaired immunosurveillance.

<p>Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common lymphoma subtype and is clinically aggressive. A meta-analysis of three new genome-wide association studies and one previous scan, totaling 3,857 cases and 7,666 controls of European ancestry, with additional genotyping of nine promising SNPs in 1,359 cases and 4,557 controls, identified five independent SNPs in four loci with genome-wide significance and point to pathways involved in immune recognition and immune function in the pathogenesis of DLBCL.

<h4 id="Follicular-Lymphomagenesis">Genetic Susceptibility for Follicular Lymphomagenesis</h4>
<p>A two-stage genome-wide association study of 4,523 follicular lymphoma (FL) cases and 13,344 controls of European ancestry identified five non-human leukocyte antigen (HLA) gene variants associated with FL risk. An analysis of the HLA region identified four linked HLA-DR&beta;1 multiallelic amino acids at positions 11, 13, 28, and 30 that were associated with FL risk. Additional independent signals included rs17203612 in HLA class II and rs3130437 in HLA class I.

<p>Genome-wide association studies have mapped risk alleles for at least ten distinct cancers to the <i>TERT-CLPTM1L</i> region of chromosome 5p15.33. An agnostic subset-based meta-analysis (ASSET) across six distinct cancers in 34,248 cases and 45,036 controls identified as many as six independent risk loci: five in the <i>TERT</i> gene and one in the neighboring <i>CLPTM1L</i> gene. Between three and five cancers mapped to each independent locus with both risk-enhancing and protective effects. Our results provide strong support for extensive pleiotropy across this region of 5p15.33, to an extent not previously observed in other cancer susceptibility loci.

For the first time, elevations in risks for subsequent bone tumors and leiomyoarcomas were shown to be higher among survivors who had been treated with alkylating agents (predominantly triethylenemelamine) plus radiotherapy versus those who received radiotherapy without chemotherapy, whereas use of alkylating agents plus radiotherapy was not associated with elevated risk for melanoma. (Wong JR, Morton LM, Tucker M, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25185089">Risk of subsequent malignant neoplasms in long-term hereditary retinoblastoma survivors after chemotherapy and radiotherapy</a>. <i>J Clin Oncol</i> 2014; E-pub Sept 2)</p>
<h4 id="Pancreatic-HL-Survivors">Pancreatic Cancer Among Hodgkin Lymphoma Survivors</h4>
<p>The investigators conducted a pancreatic cancer case-control study within a cohort of 19,882 Hodgkin lymphoma survivors diagnosed from 1953 to 2003. Pancreatic cancer risk increased with increasing radiation dose to the pancreatic tumor location and increasing number of alkylating agent (AA)-containing cycles of chemotherapy. The joint effect of subdiaphragmatic radiation (&ge;10 Gy) and &ge;6 AA-containing chemotherapy cycles was significantly greater than additive and nonsignificantly greater than multiplicative. Especially high risks were observed among patients receiving &ge;8400 mg/m(2) of procarbazine with nitrogen mustard or &ge;3900 mg/m(2) of cyclophosphamide.

<p id="Immune-Inflammation-Markers">In a study of levels of 78 inflammation, immune, and metabolic markers measured using multiplex immune assays in 1,819 Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO) participants, smoking was associated with a broad range of alterations in systemic immune and inflammation marker levels among older, long-term smokers. Smoking cessation may result in marker levels reverting to those of never-smokers over time.

<p>An independent panel of scientists from the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has affirmed the National Toxicology Program&rsquo;s (NTP) 2011 classification of formaldehyde as a &ldquo;known human carcinogen&rdquo; in its 12<sup>th</sup> Report of Carcinogens (RoC). The <a href="http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=18948">NAS report on formaldehyde carcinogenicity</a> was published August 8, 2014.</p>
<p>In 2012, Congress mandated an NAS review of the NTP&rsquo;s evaluation of formaldehyde and for NAS to conduct a separate comprehensive assessment of the peer-reviewed scientific literature on formaldehyde exposure. The panel took into consideration all relevant studies and reviews of formaldehyde, including human, animal, and mechanistic studies published before and after the 2011 RoC through November 2013.</p>
<p>They concluded there was &ldquo;clear and convincing epidemiologic evidence to support the association of formaldehyde and nasopharyngeal cancer, sinonasal cancer, and myeloid leukemia in humans&rdquo;. Panel members judged the strength of the evidence based on epidemiologic study design and exposure assessment methods.</p>
<p>Several DCEG studies were relied upon in the reviews, reflecting the Division&rsquo;s seminal research among populations exposed to formaldehyde, particularly studies of workers with occupational exposure, led by investigators in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch.

<p>In a large international collaborative analysis of risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), scientists were able to quantify risk associated with medical history, lifestyle factors, family history of blood or lymph-borne cancers, and occupation for 11 different NHL subtypes, including less common subtypes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Each year, more than half a million people worldwide are diagnosed with NHL, a diverse group of cancers of the immune system. Although past research suggested different subtypes of NHL may have different causes, those individual studies lacked sufficient statistical power to show this definitively. To overcome this problem, over 100 scientists from the <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/InterLymph/">International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium</a> pooled data from their studies to produce 13 papers published as a monograph in the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i> on August 30, 2014. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_contentid=707517" sys_contentid="707517" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" sys_dependentvariantid="704" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="707517" sys_variantid="704" sys_relationshipid="7277360">Read more in the full NCI News Note</a>.</p>

<p>In June, Yikyung Park, Sc.D., left the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) to take a position as an associate professor in the Division of Public Health Sciences, Department of Surgery, Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, Missouri.</p>
<p>Dr. Park joined DCEG in 2006 as an NIH-AARP postdoctoral fellow and was later promoted to a staff scientist. She managed the Division&rsquo;s activities within the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and supervised the linking of AARP and Medicare data. Dr. Park's leadership in this effort has provided a unique opportunity to create a longitudinal dataset that includes both pre- and post-diagnostic diet and lifestyle information, as well as cancer treatment and comorbidity data. This valuable dataset will strengthen ongoing research of medically-documented conditions related to cancer incidence, survival, and non-cancer outcomes.</p>

<p>A new study of women at high risk of ovarian cancer but with no clinical signs of the disease, who underwent risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) found cancer in the removed tissues of 2.6 percent (25 of 966) of the participants. RRSO is a surgical procedure in which a woman&rsquo;s ovaries and fallopian tubes are preventively removed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The participants included women known to carry a harmful mutation in the <i>BRCA1</i> gene or the <i>BRCA2</i> gene, as well as women considered at high risk because of a strong family history of the disease. Cancer was detected in tissues from 4.6 percent of the women who carried a <i>BRCA1</i> mutation, 3.5 percent of those with a <i>BRCA2</i> mutation and 0.5 percent of women who had a family history but did not carry a <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> mutation. The researchers also found that some of these cancers arose in the fallopian tubes, a result that supports emerging evidence that many malignancies classified as ovarian cancer actually arise in the fallopian tubes. This underscores the importance of fallopian tube removal as part of risk-reducing surgery. These cancer risk estimates provide the best available information for high-risk women considering RRSO. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_contentid=822011" sys_contentid="822011" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" sys_dependentvariantid="704" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="822011" sys_variantid="704" sys_relationshipid="7276503">Read more in the full NCI News Note</a>.</p>

<p>Researchers have newly identified 23 common genetic variants&mdash;one-letter changes in DNA known as single-nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs&mdash;that are associated with risk of prostate cancer. These results come from an analysis of more than 10 million SNPs in data pooled from studies that included over 43,000 men with prostate cancer and nearly 44,000 men without the disease. Study participants were from Australia, Ghana, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States and were of diverse ancestry. Fifteen of the newly identified variants were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer among men of European ancestry, seven were associated with increased risk in other populations, and one variant was associated with early-onset prostate cancer (prostate cancer in men under the age of 70).</p>
<p>These 23 genetic variants, together with 76 prostate cancer risk variants identified in earlier studies, explain 33 percent of the familial risk of prostate cancer in populations of European ancestry. Additional studies are ongoing to explain risk in non-European populations.&nbsp;The study, co-led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" sys_contentid="349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349630" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276482">Stephen J.

<p>Six winners have been announced for the inaugural DCEG Informatics Tool Challenge. The competitive funding challenge was conceived by DCEG Director <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7266439" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349630" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349630">Stephen J. Chanock, M.D.</a> &ldquo;Innovation has always been the hallmark of DCEG&rsquo;s research approach,&rdquo; said Dr. Chanock. &ldquo;The challenge was a new approach for us, and one that I hope will help bring to bear the endless possibilities of our modern technological and informatics environment to further enhance DCEG&rsquo;s research approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Proposals were evaluated for their innovative use of current technologies to address a specific research need, the ability for the project to be completed within one year of initiation, and the cost, which was not to exceed $20,000.</p>
<p>NCI&rsquo;s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT) is providing technical support for three of the projects, with contractors or collaborators providing support for the other three projects.</p>
<p>Out of ten proposals that were submitted, the six described below were selected for funding:</p>
<h4>Cancer Mortality Maps &ndash; A major update</h4>
<p><em>David P. Check, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=12&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349681" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7266435" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349681" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349681">Susan S.

Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.</a>, Carl McCabe, Ph.D. (DCEG); Ruth Parsons, Dave Hacker, James Cucinelli, Jeremy Lyman, Tim McNeel (IMS); Zaria Tatalovich (DCCPS)</em></p>
<p>The <a href="http://ratecalc.cancer.gov/">Cancer Mortality Maps (CMM) website</a> uses mortality data from the National Center for Health Statistics and population data from the U.S. Census to enable researchers to generate maps of cancer mortality. Cancer maps have led researchers to conduct informative in-depth epidemiologic studies of geographic areas with unusual patterns in cancer mortality. In coordination with the NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), this project will merge the CMM website&rsquo;s long-term historical data with DCCPS&rsquo;s <a href="https://gis.cancer.gov/geoviewer/">GeoViewer map application</a>, improving on the CMM site&rsquo;s graphics and functionality.</p>
<h4>Online risk assessment tool for lung cancer screening</h4>

As a scientific work-in-progress, the tool would be intended for use by other researchers and potentially by health policy groups evaluating risk-based CT lung screening guidelines.</p>
<h4>A tool to calculate organ doses for patients undergoing radiographic or fluoroscopic examinations</h4>
<p><em><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=26&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349634" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7266440" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349634" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349634">Choonsik Lee, Ph.D.</a> and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=24&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349596" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7266441" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349596" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349596">Steven L. Simon, Ph.D.</a> (DCEG)</em></p>
<p>In this project, researchers develop a computer program to calculate radiation doses to body organs in pediatric and adult patients undergoing radiographic examinations or fluoroscopically-guided procedures. Radiation exposures from medical sources are the largest and fastest growing source of radiation to the U.S. population. The proposed tool will be a critical asset for researchers studying cancer risk from these medical procedures. Initially the program will be used by DCEG dosimetrists on epidemiological studies in the U.S. Radiologic Technologists cohort, and later disseminated to medical physicists and radiologists in clinical practice.</p>
<h4><em>LD Link</em>: A tool to simplify the task of finding correlated alleles of SNPs in high linkage disequalibrium</h4>
<p><em><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=279&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302640" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7266442" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302640" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302640">Mitchell Machiela, Sc.D. M.P.H</a> (DCEG); Robert Shirley, Sue Pan (CBIIT)</em></p>
<p>Fine mapping and functional studies are widely employed by DCEG investigators to identify causal variants from genome-wide association studies hits. Several tools exist to help investigators select single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers for highly correlated regions of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the human genome; however, no simple online interface is available for identifying alleles that are commonly inherited together when two SNPs are in high LD. The current approach is time-consuming and requires programming expertise and substantial computational resources. <em>LD Link</em> will simplify this task while saving time and computational resources.</p>
<h4>CrossTalk: A web tool for comparative age-period-cohort analysis</h4>
<p><em><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349657" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7266443" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349657" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349657">Philip S. Rosenberg, Ph.D.</a>, David P. Check, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349669" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7266444" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349669" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349669">William F. Anderson, M.D., M.P.H.</a> (DCEG); Robert Shirley, Sue Pan (CBIIT)</em></p>
<p>The web tool will be used to conduct comparative age-period-cohort analysis of &ldquo;two-hazard&rdquo; problems, that is to say, a pair of hazards, each with its own set of age-period-cohort parameters. An example would be the same cancer in different populations. The tool as envisioned could be used for hypothesis testing as well as rate-ratio estimation. This tool builds on the <a href="http://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/apc"><b>NCI Age Period Cohort Analysis Web Tool</b></a> recently developed in collaboration with experts in CBIIT (manuscript in review at <i>CEBP</i>). Significant efficiencies in development of the comparative tool will be achieved because much of the web code and features will be based on code that was previously developed for the first tool. (Update: Rosenberg PS, Check DP, Anderson WF.<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146089"> A web tool for age-period-cohort analysis of cancer incidence and mortality rates</a>. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</i> 2014 Nov;23:2296-2302.

Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.</a> (DCEG); Y Li, D Li (U of Maryland)</em></p>
<p>To enable more routine use of case-cohort design, DCEG investigators will develop a tool for Poisson regression analysis of data from case-cohort studies. Case-cohort design offers cost savings by measuring biomarkers on a subcohort, or random sample of individuals from a cohort, and all the cases as opposed to measuring biomarkers on a full cohort. Using case-cohort design with Poisson regression analysis also offers the ability to estimate absolute risk of disease with the added benefit of allowing for multiple complex time variables. The proposed tool will be created in the R programming language commonly used by statisticians.</p>

<p>Dr. Gadalla investigates the role of genetic factors in cancer etiology and explores factors that may modify disease risk among individuals at high risk of developing cancer. She has received numerous awards for her work, including a DCEG Intramural Research Award and an NCI Director&rsquo;s Intramural Innovation Award.</p>
<p>As a child growing up in Egypt, Dr. Gadalla&rsquo;s goal was to become a physician in order to help people. However, once she started practicing medicine, she realized something was missing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t enough for me to treat patients, to see them come and go,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted to participate in producing what&rsquo;s delivered to patients by exploring the science leading to better clinical care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Gadalla was offered a scholarship to attend the University of Maryland, Baltimore where she earned her master&rsquo;s and Ph.D. degrees in epidemiology. After completing her doctoral research project under the mentorship of DCEG investigator James J. Goedert, M.D., she set her sights on the field of clinical epidemiology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I started my fellowship in DCEG with the desire to study outcomes after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation,&rdquo; Dr. Gadalla said. &ldquo;The moment I met with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=43&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349621" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349621" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260624" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349621">Sharon Savage</a>, I realized that the Clinical Genetics Branch was a perfect match.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a fellow and later as a staff scientist, Dr. Gadalla focused on the role of telomere biology in outcomes after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, starting with patients who received transplantation for dyskeratosis congenita, an inherited bone marrow failure and cancer susceptibility telomere biology disorder. She also utilized her training and interest in translational science to follow up on clinical observations from neurologists at the University of Rochester regarding cancer occurrence among their patients with myotonic dystrophy&mdash; a multi-system genetic disorder and the most common form of adult-onset muscular dystrophy.</p>
<p>Dr. Gadalla, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=19&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349677" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349677" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260625" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349677">Mark H. Greene, M.D.</a>, and other collaborators investigated patient cancer rates in the Swedish and Danish registry data and in 2011 reported elevated risks for a number of cancers, suggesting myotonic dystrophy as a new cancer susceptibility syndrome (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22166607" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="hidden">Cancer risk among patients with myotonic muscular dystrophy</span><i>JAMA</i>, 2011</a>).</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got hooked on myotonic dystrophy research; it&rsquo;s the questions that drive me,&rdquo; Dr. Gadalla said. &ldquo;We are now expanding, reaching out to find other large databases to re-confirm our observation. We are also pursuing new ideas to identify factors that predispose myotonic dystrophy patients to particular cancers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As a tenure-track investigator, Dr. Gadalla investigates the molecular and environmental drivers of myotonic dystrophy-associated carcinogenesis, and applies these insights into improving patient clinical care. &ldquo;We are working closely with the myotonic dystrophy scientific and patient communities in the hope that we can together build more understanding,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Gadalla is continuing her research on telomere biology, leveraging lessons learned from dyskeratosis congenita to understand phenotypic variability in the wide spectrum of telomere biology disorders. She is leading studies to understand how telomere length may contribute to outcomes for patients who receive hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking forward to building resources and expanding to new collaborators,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a big believer in team science. It&rsquo;s not an easy task, but when you work with rare diseases, it&rsquo;s the way to go.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Trabert concentrates her research on the role of exogenous and endogenous hormones in cancer etiology, and the relationship between chronic inflammation and risk of gynecologic cancers. She has received numerous awards for her work, including the NCI Director&rsquo;s Intramural Innovation Award and NIH Fellows Award for Research Excellence.</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert first discovered the field of epidemiology during an undergraduate course on insects and health. &ldquo;I thought the class and public health in general was fascinating, so my dad put me in touch with a family friend who studied birth defects at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That led me to pursue a master&rsquo;s in epidemiology at Emory University, which was right next door to the CDC.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While at Emory, Dr. Trabert became interested in sexually transmitted infections and associated morbidities. She went on to obtain another master&rsquo;s degree in biostatistics from the University of Michigan, and ultimately a Ph.D. in epidemiology from the University of Washington.</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert was introduced to DCEG after presenting an abstract at the NIH National Graduate Student Research Conference. During that trip, she met <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=39&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349672" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260626" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349672">Louise A.

<p>&ldquo;I decided to pursue postdoctoral training with DCEG because I wanted to expand the breadth of my research in reproductive health to include cancer as an endpoint,&rdquo; Dr. Trabert said.</p>
<p>As a fellow in HREB, Dr. Trabert evaluated the influence of pre- and post-natal risk factors on testicular cancer with Dr. McGlynn and expanded her research interests to include ovarian and endometrial cancers with Drs. Brinton and Wentzensen. Using the <a href="http://dietandhealth.cancer.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study</a>, Dr. Trabert provided the strongest evidence to date that the use of estrogen plus progestin mitigates the increased risk of endometrial cancer observed with estrogen-only menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22553145"><span class="hidden">Is estrogen plus progestin menopausal hormone therapy safe with respect to endometrial cancer risk?</span><i>Int J Cancer</i>, 2013</a>).</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert has been a key player in the development of two novel hormone assays with colleagues at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. These assays measure androgens and androgen metabolites, and progesterone and progesterone metabolites.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know from research on MHT that progesterone reduces the risk of endometrial cancer, but increases the risk of breast cancer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Combined with the existing capacity to measure estrogens and estrogen metabolites, these assays will help advance our understanding of the hormonal etiology of cancers in both men and women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Trabert is attempting to clarify how chronic inflammation is linked to ovarian and endometrial cancer risk. With Dr. Wentzensen and other colleagues, she recently published a study showing that women who take low dose daily aspirin, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, may reduce their risk of ovarian cancer (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24503200" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><span class="hidden">Aspirin, nonaspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, and acetaminophen use and risk of invasive epithelial ovarian cancer: a pooled analysis in the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium.</span><i>JNCI</i>, 2014</a>). They are currently working to replicate this significant finding in the Ovarian Cancer Cohort Consortium.</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert is also studying the long-term effects of fertility treatment, in particular whether ovulation-inducing drugs or specific <i>in vitro</i> fertilization procedures, which may result in ovarian trauma and inflammation, are associated with increased ovarian cancer risk. &ldquo;This area of study is especially important, given the growing number of women seeking fertility treatment,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>As Dr. Trabert continues in her career as a tenure-track investigator, she is motivated to better understand how reproductive health relates to cancer risk, and specifically risk for ovarian cancer. &ldquo;I hope to find important etiologic clues that will inform ovarian cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment, all of which are critically needed for this disease,&rdquo; she said.</p>

Dr. Yang seeks to identify susceptibility genes for rare cancers that sometimes aggregate in families. To carry out this work she employs cutting-edge genomic technologies and novel statistical approaches to uncover genetic changes associated with risk for several familial cancers including melanoma and dysplastic nevi syndrome and chordoma.</p>
<p>Throughout her career in DCEG, Dr. Yang has leveraged successful research approaches from one study to advance her work in another malignancy. For example, through a genome-wide search for copy number variations (CNVs), she identified the first susceptibility gene for familial chordoma&mdash;a germline duplication of the <i>T</i> gene that had eluded previous studies that focused on single nucleotide variants. Using funding from a 2008 DCEG Intramural Research Award, she applied the same technique in melanoma-prone families and identified a germline duplication in a family without mutations in known melanoma genes. She presented these findings at the 2014 NCI Intramural Research Retreat.</p>
<p>In addition to looking for CNVs, Dr. Yang evaluates exome sequencing variants as well as mRNA expression, miRNA expression, DNA methylation, chromatin modification, and telomere length. Most recently, Dr. Yang and her colleagues identified a rare <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/research-news-highlights/2014/POT1-familial-melanoma">inherited mutation in a gene involved in maintaining telomere stability<span class="hidden">PubMed abstract</span></a> in melanoma families, further supporting a role for abnormal telomeres in the development of melanoma.</p>
<p>In her investigation of etiologic heterogeneity of breast cancer, Dr. Yang characterizes the molecular signature of tumors using tissue microarray and integrated tumor profiling analyses to identify risk factors for specific cancer subtypes. She is currently leading breast cancer studies in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. The main goals of these studies are to identify distinct molecular alterations in tumors and adjacent normal tissues among Asian women and to examine the associations of these molecular changes with genetic and environmental risk factors, breast tissue composition and density, and breast cancer subtypes.</p>
<p>Dr. Yang received a Ph.D. in physiology from the Lombardi Cancer Center, Georgetown University in 1999, and an M.P.H. in epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in 2003. She joined the Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) in 2000 as a post-doctoral fellow, and became a tenure-track investigator in 2006. Dr. Yang received NCI Director&rsquo;s Intramural Innovation Awards in 2007 and 2009.&nbsp; She serves on the editorial board for <i>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention</i>, and is an adjunct associate professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</p>

<ul>
<li>Discovery in 1969, with Dr. Frederick P. Li, of a hereditary, multicancer syndrome affecting children and young adults in families, which came to be called Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. This research eventually led to collaborative molecular studies that uncovered inherited mutations in the <i>p53</i> tumor suppressor gene.</li>
<li>The creation of computer-generated maps showing geographic variation in cancer mortality at the county level. These &ldquo;cancer maps&rdquo; enabled Dr. Fraumeni and his colleagues to recognize distinctive patterns of certain malignancies and identify several environmental, occupational, and lifestyle risk factors for cancer.</li>
<li>His emphasis on collaborative research incorporating new and emerging molecular technologies into population- and family-based studies. This approach, now called molecular epidemiology, is helping to dissect the genetic and environmental components of cancer, along with their combined effects on the origins and progression of cancer.</li>
</ul>
<p>The award was announced at a special awards dinner in October as part of the 2014 Medical Alumni Weekend activities.</p>

The variant, rs7257330, is in the promoter region of the <i>CCNE1</i> gene, which encodes for cyclin E protein, a cell cycle regulator. This result comes from a fine-mapping analysis of data from two bladder cancer genome-wide association studies and functional studies. As the first and the only germline genetic marker that significantly discriminates between aggressive and non-aggressive bladder cancer, rs7257330 could be useful for inclusion in bladder cancer risk prediction models, in combination with established bladder cancer risk factors and other genetic markers.</p>

<p>Infection with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) &mdash;a bacterium found in the stomach of about two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s population&mdash;is a major cause of gastric cancer.</p>
<p>The most recent findings from a study of <i>H. pylori</i> treatment in Shandong Province, China, showed long-term benefits from antibiotic treatment for the infection on gastric cancer incidence<sup>1</sup>, both overall and in specific subgroups. Specifically, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=22&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349622" sys_contentid="349622" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276070" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349622" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1965">Mitchell H. Gail, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, and collaborators found that a two-week course of <i>H. pylori</i> treatment given 15 years earlier was associated with lower gastric cancer incidence and mortality in older adults (aged 55 years and older). Incidence, but not mortality, was also statistically significantly reduced in subjects with advanced precancerous lesions. Protective effects (not statistically significant) were seen in patients with <i>H. pylori</i> after treatment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A previous report from the same trial found that <i>H. pylori</i> treatment was significantly associated with reductions in gastric cancer incidence overall when compared to placebo<sup>2</sup>. Lowered gastric cancer mortality was also suggested. The present report shows that benefits extended to subgroups with precancerous lesions at baseline and older adults. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The study, known as the Shandong Intervention Trial, was a blinded, randomized placebo-controlled intervention trial started in 1995 by NCI and collaborators at the Beijing Institute for Cancer Research with the purpose of reducing the prevalence of precancerous gastric lesions and gastric cancer in a high-risk Chinese population<sup>3</sup>. Out of three assigned interventions (antibiotic treatment of <i>H. pylori</i>; daily supplementation with a combination of alpha-tocopherol, vitamin C, and selenium; or daily supplementation with garlic extracts), only <i>H. pylori</i> treatment reduced the prevalence of precancerous gastric lesions in study participants.</p>

Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.</a>, Director of the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, welcomed Dr. Hunter, &ldquo;[He] has been a friend and supporter of DCEG for a very long time. He was instrumental in developing the Cohort Consortium and the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) initiative, and continues to be an essential collaborator.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Hunter presented a seminar titled &ldquo;Global cancer trends and what we can do about them.&rdquo; His talk touched on a pivotal issue for all cancer epidemiologists: what steps can be taken to reduce cancer incidence and death?</p>
<p>The number of worldwide cancer deaths is increasing, largely due to population growth and aging. &ldquo;Much of the population growth is happening in developing parts of the world, so the cancer spectrum in those countries will dominate future cancer deaths,&rdquo; Dr. Hunter said.</p>
<p>Dr. Hunter challenged the audience to think broadly about ways to attenuate this trend. For example, certain cancer risk factors like smoking, infections, and obesity are modifiable and could theoretically be reduced or eliminated. In doing so, how much worldwide cancer may be prevented?</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we eliminated smoking and made plausible reductions in hepatitis B and C, human papillomavirus, and <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infections, we could reduce world cancer incidence by about 30 percent,&rdquo; Dr. Hunter said. Though his estimates have limitations, they indicate that a significant portion of cancer incidence could be prevented by modified behavior and interventions.</p>
<p>Next, Dr. Hunter looked at how many worldwide cancer deaths could be decreased if current therapies were widely available. There are large disparities in cancer survival rates, in part because many developing countries don&rsquo;t have access to modern treatment. Dr. Hunter speculated that if every country had U.S. cancer survival rates, worldwide cancer mortality would decrease by 43 percent. If smoking, infections, and obesity were also eliminated, worldwide cancer mortality would decrease by 66 percent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would suggest that we can do a lot about these trends in cancer deaths,&rdquo; Dr. Hunter said. &ldquo;None of this is simple, but I think it can be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Hunter also participated in several lively meetings with DCEG investigators and fellows over his two-day visit. Discussion topics included career advancement for young investigators, DCEG&rsquo;s role in future breast cancer research, and the transformation of epidemiology in the era of consortia and data sharing.</p>

<p>DCEG Director Stephen J. Chanock, M.D., commented, &ldquo;Dr. Freedman&rsquo;s training in biomedical sciences and epidemiology, his impressive track record of important publications covering a variety of classical and molecular epidemiologic approaches to several malignancies, his outstanding mentoring talents, and most particularly his collegial and inclusive approach to science, make him an ideal choice to lead DCEG&rsquo;s commitment to the incredibly rich PLCO resource.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Freedman takes over from Mark Purdue, Ph.D., formerly of DCEG&rsquo;s Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch. Dr. Purdue led the PLCO team for five years, and with the help of Amanda Black, Ph.D., and Wen-Yi Huang, Ph.D., was responsible for DCEG&rsquo;s role in the development and success of this national resource. Dr. Purdue now serves as Executive Scientific Director of the Ontario Health Study.</p>
<p>PLCO started as a large, population-based randomized trial designed and sponsored by the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention and DCEG to determine the effects of screening on cancer-related mortality and secondary endpoints in men and women aged 55 to 74.</p>
<p>In addition, PLCO has collected health information and biospecimens (multiple blood draws and some tissue samples) from participants to answer many other questions about cancer and other chronic diseases. The screening component of the trial was completed in 2006, and participants remain under follow-up for cancer occurrence and mortality. Such follow-up strengthens PLCO as a prized resource for molecular epidemiologic research and provides long-term data on the trial&rsquo;s primary endpoints.</p>

In the United States, maps plotting cancer deaths already had highlighted geographic regions with high or low mortality rates, which, in turn, generated the underlying hypotheses for new studies. Chinese cancer maps illustrated interesting patterns of risk for cancers of the lung, esophagus, and stomach and set the course for investigations with DCEG that continue to this day.</p><div class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" contenteditable="false" inlinetype="rxvariant" rxinlineslot="105" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentid="855116" sys_dependentvariantid="2082" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4862823" sys_siteid="475"><figure class="image-center" rxanchortext=""><a class="article-image-enlarge" contenteditable="false" href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=855116&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_folderid=847707&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1518&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_command=edit" target="_blank" unselectable="on">Enlarge</a> <img alt="An example of a cancer map illustrates stomach cancer mortality among males in China between 1973-1975.

<p>Women with abnormal results on cervical cancer screening, which is usually done via scraping cells from the surface of the cervix, are referred for colposcopy and biopsy to detect cervical cancer precursors (typically classified as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, or HSIL). The biopsy results determine whether excision of the lesion is required. Colposcopy with a single biopsy can fail to detect HSIL. This study involved 690 women who had up to four distinct lesions biopsied. The sensitivities for detecting HSIL increased from 60.6 percent for a single biopsy to 85.6 percent for two biopsies to 95.6 percent for three biopsies. The study report appeared Nov. 24, 2014, in the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i>. <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/newscenter/newsfromnci/2014/MultipleColposcopyJCO">Read more in the full NCI News Note</a>.</p>

<p>On December 19, 2014, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349642" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349642" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260436" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349642">Amy Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez, D. Phil.</a>, was named Chief of the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB). Dr. Berrington is an internationally recognized expert in the field of cancer risk from medical radiation exposure. Her highly cited research into the potential cancer risks from CT scans has helped to inform clinical practice, as well as guidelines for cancer screening. Mindful of the critical balance of benefit and risk of diagnostic and treatment modalities involving radiation, Dr. Berrington&rsquo;s work provides data to regulatory agencies on best practices for lowering doses and limiting the number of unnecessary CT scans, especially in children. She is the NCI Principal Investigator for the first study of children with these exposures; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3418594/">findings from the UK Pediatric CT Scans Study were published in <i>The Lancet</i></a>. In addition, Dr. Berrington continues to carefully monitor and study the potential risks from emerging radiotherapy technologies, including Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy and proton therapy, which have experienced a 7-fold increase in the number of centers in the U.S. over the last ten years. In 2013 she presented this work in an NIH Director&rsquo;s Seminar <a href="http://videocast.nih.gov/summary.asp?Live=12262&amp;bhcp=1">"Medical radiation and cancer risk: assessing the price of progress" (video)</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Berrington takes over from <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349666" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349666" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260437" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349666">Martha Linet, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, who has served as Chief of REB since 2002. In addition to her many scientific contributions to the field of radiation epidemiology, Dr. Linet leaves as her legacy an outstanding, multidisciplinary team of investigators, including world-class radiation scientists whom she recruited, and the dosimetry unit, which has thrived during the last 12 years. &ldquo;I am grateful to Martha for her extraordinary vision and leadership,&rdquo; said <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349630" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260438" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349630">Stephen J. Chanock, M.D.</a>, Director of DCEG. &ldquo;REB studies the most pressing issues in radiation and cancer. &nbsp;These include medical radiation exposures, which Dr. Linet identified as a growing public health concern when she first became chief, exposures and risks from emerging radiologic technologies and from radiation disasters, and biomarkers and other features characterizing high-risk individuals in radiation-exposed populations.&rdquo; Dr. Linet will remain a senior investigator in the branch.</p>
<p>Dr. Berrington has appointed <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349679" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349679" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260439" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349679">Ruth Kleinerman, M.P.H.</a>, as Assistant Branch Chief. Ms. Kleinerman&mdash;an expert on second cancers following radiation therapy&mdash;will continue leading the large follow-up study of late effects in adult survivors of retinoblastoma, as well as her engagement on several other branch initiatives. She takes over from <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=12&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349690" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349690" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260440" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349690">Kiyohiko Mabuchi, M.D., Dr.P.H.</a>, who during his tenure transformed the branch&rsquo;s long-standing collaboration with the Japanese Atomic Bomb Survivors Study from involving just a few DCEG senior investigators to a growing number of junior researchers in the branch, and incorporated genetic/genomic studies to develop a better understanding of the biological basis of and genetic susceptibility for radiation-related cancer. Dr. Mabuchi will remain a senior scientist in the branch and head of the Chernobyl Research Unit.</p>
<p>REB includes world leaders in radiation epidemiology, statistics, and health physics, and is the largest radiation epidemiology research group in the world. The branch&rsquo;s research touches the lives of every American, with investigations into the potential cancer risks from medical radiation exposure, to the study of second cancers resulting in part from cancer treatments, to exposure and risk from occupational and environmental radiation sources. REB&rsquo;s interdisciplinary team carries out complex dose reconstruction efforts to project associated cancer risks for cleanup workers and populations living near the accident sites, such as the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, estimates global burden of cancer from nuclear weapons testing fallout, and assesses risks of cancer and other serious outcomes among technologists and physicians who use radiation in medical diagnostics and treatment. They also work in tandem with experts at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Japan to continue the long-term follow-up of survivors of the atomic bombs, which forms the basis for all low-dose radiation protection standards. To support this research, REB develops cutting edge methods and research tools&mdash;available for use by the broader scientific community&mdash;such as <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=8&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=395633" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="395633" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7260441" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="395633">RadRat, an online calculator to estimate cancer risk from exposure to low-dose radiation</a>. In addition, REB continues to monitor the possible cancer risks from cell phones&mdash;a matter of ongoing public concern&mdash;as well as other sources of non-ionizing radiation (ultraviolet radiation and power frequency magnetic fields), and operates a highly successful training program for junior investigators.</p>

<h3 id="Breast-Cancer">Breast Cancer</h3>
<h4 id="Gene-Environment">Gene-Environment Interaction</h4>
<p>COMMENTARY: Garcia-Closas M, Gunsoy NB, Chatterjee N. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25392194">Combined associations of genetic and environmental risk factors: implications for prevention of breast cancer</a>. <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2014;106 pii: dju305. doi:10.1093/jnci/dju305</p>
<h4 id="Tamoxifen">Tamoxifen Effects on Mammographic Density</h4>
<p>A study using data from Kaiser Permanente Northwest (1990-2008) showed that younger and older ER-positive breast cancer patients who experience large reductions in mammographic density following tamoxifen therapy initiation have an improved prognosis. (Nyante SJ, Sherman ME, Pfeiffer RM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25663687">Prognostic significance of mammographic density change after initiation of tamoxifen for ER-positive breast cancer</a>. <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2015; 107:E-pub Feb 6)</p>
<h4 id="TDLU">Terminal Duct Lobular Units</h4>
<p>Terminal duct lobular units (TDLU) are the predominant origin of breast cancers. In an investigation using samples from the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank, the authors found that select circulating hormones, implicated in breast cancer risk, are associated with levels of TDLU involution, which offers new insights into breast carcinogenesis. (Khodr ZG, Sherman ME, Pfeiffer RM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25472681">Circulating sex hormones and terminal duct lobular unit involution of the normal breast</a>. <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</i> 2014;23:2765-2773).</p>

<h3 id="Cervical-Cancer">Cervical Cancer</h3>
<h4 id="Screening-Clinical-Guidance">Cervical Cancer Screening Clinical Guidance</h4>
<p>CLINICAL COMMENTARY:<b> </b>Huh WK, Ault KA, Chelmow D, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25579107">Use of primary high-risk human papillomavirus testing for cervical cancer screening: Interim clinical guidance</a>.<b> </b><i>Gynecol Oncol </i>2015 Feb;136:178-182. Published simultaneously in <i>Gynecologic Oncology, Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease,</i> and <i>Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology</i>.</p>
<h4 id="Methyl-Haplotypes">HPV 16 Methyl-haplotypes and Cervical Precancer</h4>
<p>The investigators developed and evaluated a next-generation bisulfite sequencing assay that assesses the degree of HPV 16 methylation to distinguish HPV 16 cervical precancer from HPV 16-positive transient infections, which can serve to identify women at high risk for cervical cancer. (Mirabello L, Frimer M, Harari A, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25081507">HPV 16 methyl-haplotypes determined by a novel next-generation sequencing method are associated with cervical precancer</a>. <i>Int J Cancer</i> 2015;136:E146-E153)</p>
<h4 id="Multiple-Biopsies">Multiple Biopsies at Colposcopy</h4>
<p>The Biopsy Study is an observational study of 690 women referred to colposcopy after abnormal cervical cancer screening results. Up to four directed biopsies were taken from distinct acetowhite lesions and ranked by colposcopic impression. Collection of additional lesion-directed biopsies during colposcopy increased detection of cervical cancer precursors, regardless of patient characteristics. Taking additional biopsies when multiple lesions are present should become the standard practice of colposcopic biopsy. (Wentzensen N, Walker JL, Gold MA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25422481">Multiple biopsies and detection of cervical cancer precursors at colposcopy</a>. <i>J Clin Oncol</i> 2014; E-pub Nov 24). <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/research-news-highlights/2014/multiple-biopsies">Read more about multiple biopsies at colposcopy</a>.</p>
<h4 id="Single-Dose">Single Dose HPV Vaccine Trial</h4>

<h3 id="Endometrial-Cancer">Endometrial Cancer</h3>
<h4 id="Early-Detection">Early Detection by DNA Hypermethylation</h4>
<p>DNA hypermethylation in endometrial cancer tissues was also seen in vaginal pool DNA collected via intravaginal tampon, demonstrating the potential of this minimally-invasive specimen collection technique as an early detection tool for EC. (Bakkum-Gamez JN, Wentzensen N, Maurer MJ, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25677060">Detection of endometrial cancer via molecular analysis of DNA collected with vaginal tampons</a>. <i>Gynecol Oncol</i> 2015;E-pub Feb 10)</p>
<h4 id="Infertility">Infertility</h4>
<p>A pooled analysis of 8153 endometrial cancer cases and 11&thinsp;713 controls showed that nulliparity and infertility appear to independently contribute to endometrial cancer risk. (Yang HP, Cook LS, Weiderpass E, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25688738">Infertility and incident endometrial cancer risk: a pooled analysis from the epidemiology of endometrial cancer consortium (E2C2)</a>. <i>Br J Cancer</i> 2015;112:925-933)</p>
<h4 id="Metabolic-Syndrome">Metabolic Syndrome</h4>
<p>A case-control study within the SEER-Medicare linked database showed that, among women age 65 and older in the United States, metabolic syndrome and its component factors increased endometrial cancer risk similarly across endometrial cancer subtypes, and independent of overweight/obesity. (Trabert B, Wentzensen N, Felix AS, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25587111">Metabolic syndrome and risk of endometrial cancer in the united states: a study in the SEER-Medicare linked database</a>.<b> </b><i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</i> 2014;24:261-267)</p>

<p>Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) are a heterogeneous group of compounds present in raw foods as well as in foods cooked at high temperatures. AGEs have been associated with insulin resistance, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation in patients with diabetes. In an analysis based on a published food database and data from the prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, consumption of dietary N(ϵ)-(carboxymethyl)lysine AGE, one of the major biologically and chemically well-characterized AGE markers, was associated with modestly increased risk of pancreatic cancer in men; it may partially explain the positive association between red meat and pancreatic cancer.

<p>A new NCI study has found that, among patients with severe aplastic anemia (SAA) who received a hematopoietic cell transplant (HCT) from an unrelated donor, those whose donor white blood cells had longer telomeres had higher survival rates five-years after transplantation than those whose donor white blood cells had shorter telomeres. By contrast, the length of telomeres in a patient&rsquo;s own white blood cells, as measured before transplantation, was not associated with survival.

<p>In 2010, an estimated 7,760 new cancers were diagnosed among the nearly 900,000 Americans known to be living with HIV infection. According to the first comprehensive study in the United States, approximately half of these cancers (3,920) were in excess of what would be expected if HIV-infected people had the same cancer risk as the general population. Researchers at NCI estimated national counts of cancers in HIV-infected individuals and determined that the most common excess malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1,440 excess cases), Kaposi sarcoma (910 excess cases), anal cancer (740 excess cases), and lung cancer (440 excess cases). This study, which extends findings from a 2011 study, was published online February 7, 2015, and will appear in the April 2015 edition of the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>.

<p>In October 2014, DCEG partnered with the Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program in NCI's Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences to host a two-day workshop titled &ldquo;Think Tank on Metabolomics and Prospective Cohorts: How to Leverage Resources.&rdquo; Metabolomics is an emerging technique to assess hundreds to thousands of small molecule metabolites simultaneously in a biofluid like blood or urine. The approach is being incorporated into many epidemiologic studies. The participants at the workshop included the leaders of more than 20 cohorts currently using metabolomics.</p>
<p>The meeting focused on how to accelerate scientific progress in this new research area by working together and leveraging existing resources. During the two days, participants presented their ongoing work in epidemiologic studies using mass-spectrometry and NMR-based metabolomics, highlighting findings for health outcomes such as cancer, heart-disease, and diabetes, and also for host factors like diet/nutrition and genetic susceptibility factors. Further discussions focused on methodological and statistical considerations for metabolomics analyses.</p>
<p>At the end of the workshop, participants identified areas of high scientific priority and agreed to pursue these common interests jointly, using a pooled analytic approach.&nbsp;Steering committee members from DCEG included <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=24&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=638988" sys_contentid="638988" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="638988" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275501">Steven Moore, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349649" sys_contentid="349649" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349649" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275502">Joshua Sampson, Ph.D.</a></p>

<p>How does physical activity influence cancer risk? DCEG scientists are investigating which cancers are affected by physical activity, what type of activity, how much activity makes a difference, effects on survival following a cancer diagnosis, and the biological mechanisms underlying these relationships.</p>

<p>There is strong evidence that physical activity reduces the risk of breast, colon, and endometrial cancer. Associations with other cancers are less clear, but <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_revision=7&amp;sys_contentid=349659&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349659" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="5290333">Charles E.

<h3>Leisure-time Physical Activity</h3>

<p>The focus of research on physical activity has recently shifted from activities associated with one’s occupation to leisure-time activity. Dr. Moore is leading a team of investigators who are using pooled data within the NCI Cohort Consortium to study the association between leisure-time physical activity and 26 different types of cancer, some rare or not previously studied. According to Dr. Moore, “This is the largest study to date of physical activity and cancer. Our results may broaden the number of cancers linked to physical activity and may suggest new avenues for prevention.”</p>

<p>Research indicates that physical activity also affects overall mortality from all causes combined. In a previous study within the Cohort Consortium, Dr. Moore and colleagues found that leisure-time physical activity was associated with longer life expectancy, even at relatively low levels of activity and regardless of body weight (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23139642"><span class="hidden">PubMed Abstract: Leisure time physical activity of moderate to vigorous intensity and mortality: a large pooled cohort analysis.</span>Moore et al., 2012</a>).</p>

<p>“Our findings highlight the important contribution that leisure-time physical activity in adulthood can make to longevity,” Dr. Moore said.</p>

<p>Ongoing studies will extend our understanding of the relationship between the amount of physical activity and mortality.

<h3>Sedentary Behavior: Is Sitting the New Smoking?</h3>

  	</div>

<p>In recent years, sedentary behavior has emerged as a risk factor for disease that is distinct from and independent of leisure-time physical activity. Sedentary behavior is linked with diabetes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease; it can also increase the risk of certain cancers, most notably colorectal and endometrial (<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/special/health/sitting/Sitting.pdf"><span class="hidden">Graphic depicting various health effects of sitting.</span>Washington Post Infographic 2014—pdf, 31.5 MB</a>), (<a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1500&amp;sys_revision=3&amp;sys_contentid=920172&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentvariantid="1500" sys_dependentid="920172" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="5290344">Text-only version of Washington Post Infographic—pdf, 54KB</a>). New insights about the adverse health effects of sitting have helped us understand some of the limitations of the prevailing strategy, regular exercise, to reduce these risks, as well as opportunities to augment this strategy. DCEG investigators have helped define the magnitude of the problem, quantify the health risks associated with sedentary behaviors, and describe the risks associated with reducing sedentary time.</p>

<p>“The average adult spends more than half their day sitting or in sedentary behaviors,” Dr. Matthews said. “We’re learning that exercise alone may not be enough to reduce the risk of cancer and other diseases.”</p>

<p>Using data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, Dr. Matthews and colleagues found that higher amounts of sitting time and television viewing were associated with mortality, even after adjustment for exercise participation (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22218159"><span class="hidden">PubMed Abstract: Amount of time spent in sedentary behaviors and cause-specific mortality in US adults.</span>Matthews et al., 2012</a>). Dr. Matthews takes this message to heart; he is often seen standing in seminars or walking on the tread-desk in his office.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators are also curious about the tradeoffs between sedentary behavior and physical activity. Dr. Matthews and colleagues recently estimated the mortality benefits associated with reducing sedentary time by an hour and replacing with different types of physical activity (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25628179"><span class="hidden">PubMed Abstract: Mortality Benefits for Replacing Sitting Time with Different Physical Activities.</span>Matthews et al., 2015</a>).</p>

<p>“We found that replacing sitting time with any type of activity was beneficial for less active adults,” Dr. Matthews said. “For more active adults, mortality was only lower for those who replaced sitting time with purposeful exercise.” DCEG fellow <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_revision=94&amp;sys_contentid=302623&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475#Keadle" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302623" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="5290337">Sarah Keadle, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, is examining television viewing as a modifiable risk factor.</p>

<p>Sleep is another health behavior that relates to sedentary behavior and physical activity; researchers are evaluating sleep as part of the full 24-hour measurement period. A recent paper by DCEG fellow <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_revision=94&amp;sys_contentid=302623&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475#Xiao" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302623" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="5290338">Qian Xiao, Ph.D.</a>, and Dr. Matthews looked at the interrelationships of sleep, physical activity, sedentary behavior, and body mass index with mortality (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25281691?dopt=Citation"><span class="hidden">PubMed Abstract: Sleep duration and total and cause-specific mortality in a large US cohort: interrelationships with physical activity, sedentary behavior, and body mass index.</span>Xiao et al., 2014</a>).</p>

<p>According to Dr. Matthews, “We are finding that sleep, sedentary behavior, and physical activity are all independently associated with mortality. Each behavior seems to have unique physiologic functions and patterns of risk for mortality.”</p>

<h3>Benefits of Physical Activity for Cancer Survivors</h3>

<p>DCEG investigators are also assessing the benefits of physical activity in cancer survivors, a population quickly growing thanks, in part, to improved cancer treatments and early detection. Evidence from observational prospective studies suggests that physical activity after cancer diagnosis may be associated with a reduced risk of cancer recurrence and improved overall mortality among multiple cancer survivor groups, including breast, colorectal, prostate, and ovarian cancer.</p>

<p>Dr. Arem and Dr. Matthews recently published a paper on exercise and television viewing habits (the most prevalent leisure-time sedentary behavior) before and after diagnosis among colorectal cancer survivors (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25488967"><span class="hidden">PubMed Abstract: Pre- and postdiagnosis physical activity, television viewing, and mortality among patients with colorectal cancer in the national institutes of health-AARP diet and health study.</span>Arem et al., 2015</a>). Increasing exercise and minimizing TV viewing both were associated with lower mortality risk among colorectal cancer survivors.</p>

<p>“This study gives us a snapshot of physical activity and sedentary behaviors among colorectal cancer survivors and how these factors might influence mortality,” according to Dr. Arem.</p>

<h3>Biomarker Studies Give Insight into Mechanisms</h3>

<p>Regular physical activity helps maintain a healthy body weight and may prevent cancers directly and indirectly, by mechanisms that include regulating hormones and providing beneficial effects on insulin and glucose metabolism, inflammatory markers, and the immune system.</p>

<div class="callout-box" style=" float: right; width: 25%; margin: 0 0 5px 10px;">
<p>“Research by DCEG investigators continues to add evidence and increase our understanding of how physical activity affects cancer...”<br />

Dr. Stephen Chanock</p>
</div>

<p>Using information recorded by a lightweight accelerometer worn by participants in the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES), Dr. Matthews and colleagues reported the first objective data on the amount of time spent in overall sedentary behaviors in a nationally representative sample (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21224291?dopt=Citation"><span class="hidden">PubMed Abstract: Sedentary time and cardio-metabolic biomarkers in US adults: NHANES 2003-06.</span>Healy et al., 2011</a>). After adjusting for the effect of exercise, the amount of daily sedentary time was linked to levels of C-reactive protein, insulin, and other cardio-metabolic biomarkers. Future DCEG metabolomic studies will continue to evaluate associations between accelerometer-based measures of active and sedentary time.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators are leveraging better measurements of physical activity and sedentary behavior with new metabolism assays, like the urinary estrogen assay. Using data and samples collected from premenopausal women in the Nurses’ Health Study II, Dr. Matthews, <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_revision=6&amp;sys_contentid=349620&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349620" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="5290339">Regina G. Ziegler, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, and colleagues from Harvard University recently found that greater leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower urinary estradiol and several metabolites in the 16-hydroxylation pathway (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855335?dopt=Citation"><span class="hidden">PubMed Abstract: Association between physical activity and urinary estrogens and estrogen metabolites in premenopausal women.</span>Matthews et al., 2012</a>). Both measures have been associated with reduced risk of breast cancer in previous studies.</p>

<p>Ongoing work will examine the effect of exercise intervention on estrogen metabolism in post-menopausal women. Investigators will also evaluate estrogen metabolism as a potential mediator of the energy balance-breast cancer association.</p>

<h3>Measurements are Key</h3>

<p>The validity of etiologic studies is dependent on the breadth, accuracy, and precision of the measured exposures or endpoints. Due to their size, prospective studies of cancer have typically relied on the self-reported questionnaire-based approach to assess physical activity. Though contemporary questionnaires ask for more detailed information about exercise and sedentary behavior, using only questionnaires may impede full understanding of the relationship between physical activity and cancer.</p>

<p>In February 2015, the Division welcomed Christopher Wild, Ph.D., Director of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), as a DCEG Visiting Scholar. Over the course of his two-day visit, Dr. Wild participated in two round-table discussions, a lunch discussion with current DCEG Fellows, and gave an inspiring keynote lecture entitled &ldquo;Necessity is the mother of prevention: Responding to the growing cancer burden worldwide.&rdquo; <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=35&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349597" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349597" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7260506" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349597">Michael B. Cook, Ph.D.</a>, served as host during his visit. DCEG Director <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7260507" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349630">Stephen J. Chanock, M.D.</a>, welcomed Dr. Wild, stating &ldquo;The shared goals of IARC and DCEG have led to close ongoing collaborations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Wild began his seminar with a personal story&mdash;an experience that shaped his research career and steered him toward cancer prevention. In 1988 he made his first visit to Africa, going &nbsp;to The Gambia with Dr. Andrew Hall for the start of a field study of hepatitis B virus (HBV) vaccination for the prevention of liver cancer, which was endemic in the region. In the clinic, Dr. Wild came face-to-face with a patient in the late stage of the disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There was no morphine. There was nothing to offer this suffering man,&rdquo; he said. Some days later, the man had died; he was in his early 30s. Dr. Wild cites his feeling of inadequacy in that moment as a critical motivating factor in his career. &ldquo;[I thought] maybe I can offer something to the next generation through research.&rdquo; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; he stressed, &ldquo;is the necessity of prevention,&rdquo; especially in low-resource settings. &ldquo;We cannot treat our way out of the cancer problem. Instead, we need a balanced, integrated approach to prevention, early detection, and treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went on to describe the overall picture of cancer incidence and prevalence today&mdash;with data made available from IARC&rsquo;s global effort to develop cancer registries&mdash;as well as key areas where small interventions could have a major impact on cancer risk. &ldquo;Prevention works, but it takes time,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s important to recognize how much has been achieved over the past five or six decades.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking to the future, Dr. Wild cited the importance of novel approaches and technologies&mdash;in particular metabolomics and molecular epidemiology&mdash;to not only confirm findings from observational studies of etiologic factors but also to inform hypotheses for future research. &ldquo;Can the tumor reveal some of the secrets of its origins?&rdquo; he asked. In particular Dr. Wild discussed how evidence from ecological studies, paired with molecular research in the laboratory, has led to a new hypothesis for renal cancer etiology in a particularly high-risk region, a finding that IARC investigators are now attempting to replicate. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Toward the end of his talk, Dr. Wild praised DCEG and stressed the need for further coordination between DCEG and IARC in the arena of prevention. &ldquo;The work you are doing is critical,&rdquo; he said. In closing, Dr. Wild came back to the study in The Gambia: &ldquo;Prevention has been a huge success. Prevalence of childhood HBV infection is lower there today than in London.&rdquo; While there has been success for liver cancer in The Gambia, there are countless communities around the world where we have yet to scratch the surface of their cancer problems. &ldquo;We have a duty to care for patients of today, and to populations of tomorrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Katki has been an integral part of the effort to provide the epidemiologic evidence that contributed to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1955&amp;sys_contentid=571160" sys_dependentvariantid="1955" sys_dependentid="571160" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7269904" sys_variantid="1955" sys_contentid="571160">new cervical cancer screening guidelines</a>.

<p>In a study of lung cancer screening, Dr. Katki and colleagues evaluated the use of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and concluded that the balance of benefits and harms <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=720369" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="720369" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7269905" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="720369">strongly depends on an individual&rsquo;s pre-screening risk of lung cancer death</a>.

<p>A new study describes prognostic factors for lung cancer spread and recurrence, as well as subsequent risk of death from the disease. NCI investigators evaluated these indicators in nearly 2,100 people in the Lombardy region of Italy who were diagnosed with lung cancer between 2002 and 2005, and who had participated in the Environment and Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study. The researchers estimated risks of metastasis and recurrence for surgically- treated (stage IA-IIIA) and non-surgically treated patients (stage IIIB-IV). The investigators observed that regardless of cancer stage, grade, or type of lung cancer, patients in the study were more likely to have distant metastasis than local recurrence. The study appeared online March 23, 2015, in <i>JNCI</i>.

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">A new study has found that people who engage in three to five times the recommended minimum level of leisure-time physical activity derive the greatest benefit in terms of mortality reduction when compared with people who do not engage in leisure-time physical activity. The <i>2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</i>, developed by the Department of Health and Human Services&rsquo; Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, recommend a minimum of 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity exercise per week or 1.25 hours of vigorous aerobic activity, but more activity is encouraged for additional health benefits. Before this study, experts did not know how much additional health benefit might accrue for those doing more exercise. This study confirms that much of the mortality benefit is realized by meeting the minimum recommended levels of physical activity and describes the increased mortality benefit associated with higher levels of physical activity.

<p>Dalsu Baris, M.D., Ph.D., staff scientist in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), retired from federal service in February 2015, to pursue a medical residency in the field of geriatric psychiatry.</p>
<p>Dr. Baris conducted important research related to the epidemiology of multiple myeloma, bladder cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL). Her investigations of myeloma were comprehensive and led to her appointment to the Scientific Advisory Board of the International Myeloma Foundation (IMF). In 2006, she received an award for her efforts as part of an international team that developed IMF&rsquo;s Bank on a Cure&copy; DNA biobanking project.<br /> <br /> Dr. Baris managed NCI&rsquo;s New England Bladder Cancer Study, a multidisciplinary study in collaboration with Dartmouth Medical School, the departments of health in Maine, Vermont and New Hampshire, and the USGS, to evaluate the 50-year elevated risk of this malignancy in this region. She, along with OEEB Chief <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349599" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349599" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7260512" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349599">Debra Silverman, Sc.D.</a>, and others, reported on increased bladder cancer risk with tobacco use, occupational exposures, water contaminants, hair dyes, and genetic susceptibility.</p>
<p>She developed important methods to study the effect of chemotherapy on blood levels of polychlorinated biphenyls, which has caused researchers around the world to strive to get pre-treatment blood samples when assessing the effect of these compounds on NHL etiology.</p>
<p>Among her achievements in her decades of service in DCEG, Dr. Baris received many awards, including an Honorable Mention Alice Hamilton Award in the category of Epidemiology and Surveillance from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health for her work on a study of firefighters.</p>

<p>In March 2015 the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) reviewed the scientific literature on five pesticides as part of the monograph program to evaluate the carcinogenic risks of chemicals. In particular, the IARC working group classified the organophosphate insecticides malathion and diazinon, and the herbicide glyphosate as probable human carcinogens. Two other organophosphate insecticides, tetrachlorvinphos and parathion were classified as possible human carcinogens. (Guyton KZ, Loomis D, Grosse Y, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25801782">Carcinogenicity of tetrachlorvinphos, parathion, malathion, diazinon, and glyphosate.</a> <i>Lancet Oncol </i>2015 Mar 20. E-pub ahead of print).</p>
<p>The consensus decisions were based on epidemiologic data, animal bioassays and mechanistic studies. Data from large case-control and cohort studies, including the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303742" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303742" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7266413" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303742">Agricultural Health Study</a>, from DCEG investigators that showed increased risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (De Roos, 2003; Alavanja, 2014), and cancers of the lung (Beane Freeman, 2005; Jones, in press) and prostate (Koutros, 2013) made important contributions to these evaluations. Former OEEB Branch Chief Aaron Blair (now Emeritus) chaired the IARC meeting. IARC is planning a review of some organochlorine insecticides and some chlorphenoxy herbicides in May 2015.</p>

<h4>Immunosuppression and Stage at Diagnosis</h4>
<p>The authors used data on 15 cancer types from U.S. cancer registries linked with HIV and transplant registries and observed that bladder cancer and melanoma were more likely to be diagnosed at a nonlocal stage in both HIV-infected individuals and transplant recipients, suggesting a role for immunosuppression in their progression. A shift for some common cancers toward later stage at diagnosis in HIV-infected individuals but earlier stage in transplant recipients suggests differential access to medical care or surveillance. (Shiels MS, Copeland G, Goodman MT, et al.<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25739496">Cancer stage at diagnosis in patients infected with the human immunodeficiency virus and transplant recipients.</a> <i>Cancer</i> 2015;121:2063-2071)</p>
<h4>Organ Transplantation</h4>
<p>Induction immunosuppression is a mainstay to prevent organ rejection after transplantation. Using a linkage of data on U.S. transplantation procedures and cancer incidence from registries, the authors found muromonab-CD3 was associated with increased risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and alemtuzumab was associated with increased risk for NHL, colorectal cancer, and thyroid cancer. Polyclonal induction was associated with increased melanoma risk. The findings highlight the relative safety of the most common induction therapies with regard to cancer risk; the need for surveillance of patients treated with alemtuzumab; and the possible role for increased melanoma screening for patients treated with polyclonal anti-T-cell induction. (Hall EC, Engels EA, Pfeiffer RM, Segev DL. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25340595">Association of antibody induction immunosuppression with cancer after kidney transplantation.</a> <i>Transplantation</i> 2015;99:1051-1057)</p>
<h4>Tobacco Attributable Risk</h4>
<p>Based on data from the National Health Interview Study, the Cancer Prevention Study-II, and the Pooled Contemporary Cohort, the population attributable fraction (PAF) for active cigarette smoking was 28.7% when estimated conservatively, including only deaths from the 12 cancers currently established as caused by smoking by the U.S. Surgeon General. The PAF was 31.7% when estimated more comprehensively, including excess deaths from all cancers. (Jacobs EJ, Newton CC, Carter BD, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25487970">What proportion of cancer deaths in the contemporary United States is attributable to cigarette smoking?</a> <i>Ann Epidemiol</i> 2015;25:179-182.e1)</p>

<h3 id="Bladder-Cancer">Bladder Cancer</h3>
<h4>Selenium and Smoking</h4>
<p>Selenium has been linked to a reduced risk of bladder cancer in some studies. An evaluation in the New England Bladder Cancer Case-Control Study, based on careful analysis of a comprehensive smoking history and selenium levels measured in toenail samples, saw no evidence of an association between selenium levels and bladder cancer. (Beane Freeman LE, Karagas MR, Baris D, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25776013">Is the inverse association between selenium and bladder cancer due to confounding by smoking?</a> <i>Am J Epidemiol</i> 2015;181:488-495)</p>

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility and Metastasis</h4>
<p>A multi-stage genome-wide association study of 935 osteosarcoma patients identified a SNP, rs7034162, in <i>NFIB</i> significantly associated with metastasis at diagnosis in European osteosarcoma cases, as well as in cases of African and Brazilian ancestry. (Mirabello L, Koster R, Moriarity BS, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26084801">A genome-wide scan identifies variants in <i>NFIB</i> associated with metastasis in patients with osteosarcoma.</a> <i>Cancer Discov</i> 2015;Epub Jun 17)</p>
<h4><i>TP53</i> Tumor Suppressor Gene</h4>
<p>Investigators sequenced the tumor suppressor gene, <i>TP53</i>, among 765 osteosarcoma patients. A higher than expected prevalence of <i>TP53</i> mutations, particularly those known to be associated with the Li-Fraumeni syndrome as well some other rare novel changes, were observed among young osteosarcoma patients, but not older patients. (Mirabello L, Yeager M, Mai PL, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25896519">Germline <i>TP53</i> variants and susceptibility to osteosarcoma.</a> <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2015; E-pub April 20). <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/research-news-highlights/2015/osteosarcoma-tp53">Read more about inherited <i>TP53</i> variations and susceptibility to osteosarcoma.</a></p>

<h4>Genomic and Somatic Integrative Analyses</h4>
<p>The authors confirmed strong association of rs78378222:A&gt;C, a rare germline single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in <i>TP53</i>, via imputation of a genome-wide association study of glioma and integrative analyses on data for glioblastoma multiforme from the Cancer Genome Atlas. Their findings suggest a rare risk allele (C) for rs78378222 disrupts mRNA termination, and an allelic loss of a genomic region harboring common protective allele (A) occurs during tumor initiation or progression for glioma. (Wang Z, Rajaraman P, Melin BS, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25907361">Further confirmation of germline glioma risk variant rs78378222 in <i>TP53</i> and its implication in tumor tissues via integrative analysis of TCGA data.</a> <i>Human Mutat</i> 2015;36:684-688)</p>

<h4>Estrogen Metabolism</h4>
<p>REVIEW: Ziegler RG, Fuhrman BJ, Moore SC, Matthews CE. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25725255">Epidemiologic studies of estrogen metabolism and breast cancer.</a> <i>Steroids</i> 2015;99(Pt A):67-75.</p>
<h4>Genetic Susceptibility for <i>In Situ</i> Breast Cancer</h4>
<p>This study, based on genotyping data from NCI&rsquo;s Breast and Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (BPC3), showed that several of the known breast cancer susceptibility loci are risk factors for both <i>in situ</i> and invasive breast cancer, with the possible exception of rs1011970, a putatively functional SNP situated in the <i>CDKN2BAS</i> gene that may be a specific breast cancer <i>in situ</i> susceptibility locus. (Campa D, Barrdahl M, Gaudet MM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26070784">Genetic risk variants associated with in situ breast cancer.</a> <i>Breast Cancer Res</i> 2015;17:82)</p>
<h4>Genetic Variation and Survival</h4>
<p>A meta-analysis of 37,954 breast cancer patients, including 2,900 deaths from breast cancer, identified a new locus (rs2059614 at 11q24.2) associated with survival in women diagnosed with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors. A second locus (rs148760487 at 2q24.2) was associated with survival among ER-positive and ER-negative case patients, but the finding was less robust than for rs2059614. (Guo Q, Schmidt MK, Kraft P, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25890600">Identification of novel genetic markers of breast cancer survival.</a> <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2015;107:doi: 10.1093/jnci/djv081)</p>
<h4>Hormones and Male Breast Cancer</h4>
<p>Using prediagnostic serum from 101 male breast cancer cases and 217 controls, serum levels of androgens were found to be largely unrelated to risk, but circulating estradiol levels showed a significant association (highest quartile: odds ratio = 2.5, trend P = .06). (Brinton LA, Key TJ, Kolonel LN, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25964249">Prediagnostic sex steroid hormones in relation to male breast cancer risk.</a> <i>J Clin Oncol</i> 2015;33:2041-2050)</p>
<h4>Microbiome</h4>
<p>This pilot study of 48 postmenopausal breast cancer cases (pretreatment) and 40 controls reported that postmenopausal women with breast cancer have altered composition and estrogen-independent low diversity of their gut microbiota. Whether these affect breast cancer risk and prognosis is unknown. (Goedert JJ, Jones G, Hua X, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26032724">Investigation of the association between the fecal microbiota and breast cancer in postmenopausal women: A population-based case-control pilot study.</a> <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2015;107:Epub Jun 1)</p>
<h4>Novel Genetic Susceptibility Loci</h4>
<p>The investigators performed a meta-analysis of 11 genome-wide association studies, comprising 15,748 breast cancer cases and 18,084 controls together with 46,785 cases and 42,892 controls from 41 studies genotyped on a 211,155-marker custom array (iCOGS). They generated genotypes for more than 11 million SNPs by imputation using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, and identified 15 new loci associated with breast cancer. Combining association analysis with ChIP-seq chromatin binding data in mammary cell lines and ChIA-PET chromatin interaction data from ENCODE, they identified likely target genes in two regions: SETBP1 at 18q12.3 and RNF115 and PDZK1 at 1q21.1. One association appears to be driven by an amino acid substitution encoded in EXO1. (Michailidou K, Beesley J, Lindstrom S, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25751625">Genome-wide association analysis of more than 120,000 individuals identifies 15 new susceptibility loci for breast cancer.</a> <i>Nat Genet</i> 2015;47:373-380)</p>
<h4>Prognostic Signature for ER-Positive Cancer</h4>
<p>A methylaion expression index (MEI) was developed through an integrated analysis of tumor expression markers, DNA methylation, and mRNA data. Low MEI was related to decreased survival among women with ER-positive breast cancer in a study conducted in Poland and in four independent datasets totaling over 2500 ER-positive breast cancers. (Figueroa J, Yang H, Garcia-Closas M, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25773928">Integrated analysis of DNA methylation, immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression, data identifies a methylation expression index (MEI) robustly associated with survival of ER-positive breast cancer patients.</a> <i>Breast Cancer Res Treat</i> 2015;150:457-466)</p>
<h4>Risk Prediction based on Genetic Variants</h4>
<p>The authors constructed a 77 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) polygenic risk score (PRS) for breast cancer overall and by estrogen receptor (ER) in a study of 33,673 women with breast cancer and 33,381 controls, both of European origin. Women in the highest 1% of the PRS had a three-fold increased risk of developing breast cancer compared with women in the middle quintile. The ORs for ER-positive and ER-negative disease were 3.7 and 2.8, respectively. Lifetime risk of breast cancer for women in the lowest and highest quintiles of the PRS were 5.2% and 16.6% for a woman without family history, and 8.6% and 24.4% for a woman with a first-degree family history of breast cancer. (Mavaddat N, Pharoah PD, Michailidou K, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25855707">Prediction of breast cancer risk based on profiling with common genetic variants.</a> <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2015;107: doi: 10.1093/jnci/djv036)</p>

<h4>HPV Genotyping in Screening</h4>
<p>To assess the possible value of HPV 16/18 typing in determining management of cervical screening outcomes, &gt;17,000 specimens from a longitudinal cohort study of initially HPV-positive women (HC2, Qiagen) were retested with the cobas&reg; HPV Test ("cobas", Roche Molecular Systems), which detects HPV 16 and HPV 18 individually, as well as a 12 other high-risk HPV types. The cobas results showed excellent agreement with an established method, the LINEAR ARRAY HPV Genotyping Test (LA, Roche Molecular Systems), and demonstrated that HPV 16 typing is useful in the management of HPV-positive/cytology-negative women in co-testing, all HPV-positive women in primary HPV testing, and perhaps in the management of HPV-positive women with ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance). (Schiffman M, Boyle S, Raine-Bennett T, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26088703">The role of human papillomavirus (HPV) genotyping in cervical cancer screening: A large-scale evaluation of the cobas HPV test.</a> <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</i> 2015;Epub June 18)</p>
<h4>HPV Vaccine</h4>
<p>Data from the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial and the PATRICIA Trial show that four years after vaccination of women aged 15-25 years, one and two doses of the HPV 16/18 vaccine seem to protect against cervical HPV 16/18 infections similar to the protection provided by the three-dose schedule. Two doses separated by 6 months additionally provided some cross-protection for other HPV types. (Kreimer AR, Struyf F, Del Rosario-Raymundo MR, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26071347">Efficacy of fewer than three doses of an HPV-16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine: Combined analysis of data from the Costa Rica Vaccine and PATRICIA trials.</a> <i>Lancet Oncol</i> 2015;16:775-786)</p>

<h3 id="Colorectal-Cancer">Colorectal Cancer</h3>
<h4>Reproductive and Hormonal Factors</h4>
<p>Although use of menopausal hormone therapy and some reproductive factors have been associated with colorectal cancer risk, the relationship between these factors and survival after colorectal cancer diagnosis are unclear. In this study of 2,053 women with colorectal cancer, reproductive and menstrual factors were not associated with mortality, while current, but not former, baseline menopausal hormone therapy use was associated with lower all-cause and colorectal cancer mortality risks. (Arem H, Park Y, Felix AS, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26103572">Reproductive and hormonal factors and mortality among women with colorectal cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.</a> <i>Br J Cancer</i> 2015;113:562-568)</p>

<h4>Carrier Frequency of <i>RTEL1</i> among Ashkenazi Jews</h4>
<p>Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome (HH) is a clinically severe variant of dyskeratosis congenita (DC), characterized by cerebellar hypoplasia, microcephaly, intrauterine growth retardation, and severe immunodeficiency, in addition to features of DC. Germline mutations in the <i>RTEL1</i> gene have recently been identified as causative of HH. In this study, the carrier frequency for c.3791G&gt;A (p.R1264H) was higher than expected, 1% in the Ashkenazi Orthodox and 0.45% in the general Ashkenazi Jewish population. Haplotype analyses suggested the presence of a common founder. The authors recommend that the c.3791G&gt;A <i>RTEL1</i> mutation be considered for inclusion in carrier screening panels in the Ashkenazi population.

<h4>Alcohol</h4>
<p>Data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial showed alcohol consumption is associated with reduced renal cell carcinoma risk in both men and women, regardless of the type of alcoholic beverage. The inverse association with consumption was apparent for ever smokers but not among never smokers.

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>The authors conducted multilevel analyses to identify potential susceptibility loci for renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which may be overlooked in traditional genome-wide association studies (GWAS). They used a GWAS dataset comprised of 894 RCC cases and 1,516 controls using GenGen, SNP ratio test, and ALIGATOR. They observed significant overexpression of HLA genes in tumor tissues, which was also supported by public databases. One SNP, rs1063355, associated with HLA-DQB1 expression, was significant in the original populations and a validation GWAS dataset.

Protein structural modeling revealed that the Y371C mutation abrogated the ability of the <i>CBL</i> protein to adopt a conformation that is required for ubiquitination. The penetrance of the <i>CBL</i> Y371C mutation was 30% for JMML and 40% for all leukemia. Of the eight mutation carriers in the family with available photographs, only one had significant dysmorphic features; the investigators found no evidence of a clinical phenotype consistent with a "<i>CBL</i> syndrome".

<h4>Indoor Air Pollution and Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>In a study of lung cancer among never smoker women in Southeast Asia, the risk associated with household coal exposure varied with the respective alleles for two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): <i>HLA Class II</i> rs2395185 and <i>TP63</i> rs4488809 (rs4600802). The roles played in the cell cycle and inflammation pathways by the proteins encoded by these two genes provide biological plausibility for these interactions; however, additional replication studies are needed in other non-smoking populations. (Hosgood HD 3rd, Song M, Hsiung CA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25566987">Interactions between household air pollution and GWAS-identified lung cancer susceptibility markers in the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia (FLCCA).</a> <i>Hum Genet</i> 2015;134:333-341)</p>
<h4>Telomere Length</h4>
<p>The authors examined a panel of seven telomere-length associated genetic variants in a large study of 5,457 never-smoking female Asian lung cancer cases and 4,493 never-smoking female Asian controls using data from a previously reported genome-wide association study. Aggregations of the seven variants were highly associated with lung cancer risk with the direction of the associations indicating that longer telomere length, as predicted by higher telomere-length-associated genetic risk score, is a risk factor for lung cancer. Although the telomere-length-associated variants explained only a fraction of the variation in telomere length, the associations suggest genetic effects tagged by these variants are important for lung cancer risk.

<h4>Autoimmune Conditions</h4>

There were also interactions with immunity-related single nucleotide polymorphisms for B-cell mediated autoimmune conditions across major B-cell NHL subtypes and follicular lymphoma.

<p>A new study shows that inherited variations in a known tumor suppressor gene among children and adolescents with osteosarcoma, a cancer of the bone, are more common than previously thought. Older patients who are also susceptible to this malignancy were not found to carry mutations in the gene, known as <i>TP53</i>. The study, finding that the genetic susceptibility to young onset osteosarcoma is distinct from older adult onset osteosarcoma, was published online April 20, 2015, in the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>. Lisa Mirabello, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, led the research. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_contentid=936592" sys_contentid="936592" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" sys_dependentvariantid="704" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="936592" sys_variantid="704" sys_relationshipid="7274879">Read the full NCI press release about this study</a>.</p>

The report surveys the clinical advances of the prior year, identifying those that are expected to make the biggest impact on improving cancer prevention, treatment, and care.</p>
<p>They demonstrated a proof-of-principle for the effect of including an individual&rsquo;s pre-screening risk of lung cancer death as part of a benefits/harms evaluation for the use of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening. By targeting lung cancer screening in this way, rather than only coarse age/smoking criteria, the efficiency of LDCT screening programs could be improved, resulting in more lung cancer death prevented and fewer false positives. This work was <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23863051">published in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i></a>.</p>

<p>Dr. Gail was recognized for his pioneering statistical work in cancer research and development of cancer risk prediction models, in particular the &ldquo;Gail model&rdquo;. In 1989, Dr. Gail described a statistical model to estimate the absolute risk for a white woman of a specific age with specific risk factors to develop breast cancer; it was the first cancer risk prediction model that could be applied in a generalized population. Today, over 2 million users per year access the adapted Gail model via the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/">NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool</a>. Dr. Gail continued to build on his findings to more accurately assess the risk of developing breast cancer among African-American, Asian-American, and Hispanic women.</p>

<p>New data from a combined analysis of two independent trials of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine strengthen previous findings from one of the trials that young women who received three, two, or one dose of the HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (Cervarix&reg;), were equally protected against infection with the HPV types included in the vaccine four years after vaccination. The data from the two trials that were pooled for this analysis were the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT) and the GSK Biologicals SA-sponsored PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults (PATRICIA) trial.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Further, investigators observed that participants who received two doses six months apart showed evidence of partial protection against other HPV types not included in the vaccine formulation; experts refer to this as cross-protection. But women who received one dose, or who received two doses just one month apart, showed no evidence of cross-protection. The study was a collaborative effort by Aim&eacute;e R. Kreimer, Ph.D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, Frank Struyf, GSK Vaccines, Cosette Wheeler, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center, and colleagues and appeared June 10, 2015, in <i>Lancet Oncology</i>. <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/fewer-doses-hpv-vaccine">Read more in the full NCI News Note</a>.</p>

He utilizes data from both family-based studies and cohorts.</p>

<p>“In clinical genetics, we say that when you hear hoof beats, don’t think horses, think zebras,” Dr. Stewart said. “I’ve always been interested in the zebras of the world.”</p>

<h3>From Chemistry to Clinical Genetics</h3>

<p>Dr. Stewart’s love of science began in childhood. These early interests led to a bachelor’s degree in chemistry, followed by a Fulbright year in New Zealand to study natural products chemistry, including synthesis of a compound with anticancer properties.</p>

<p>“I enjoyed the chemistry, but I was more intrigued about what could be done with this compound,” Dr. Stewart recalled. “At the end of the day, I liked the idea of doing something with an impact on human health.”</p>

<p>That experience led him to pursue a medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine. While at Penn, he attended a neurology lecture on muscular dystrophy. The speaker described a gene therapy project to transplant a mutated dystrophin gene from a patient with a mild form of the disease into children with the full-blown disease.</p>

<p>“I was just so taken by this idea, using a quirky version of dystrophin to try and help these kids,” Dr. Stewart said. “I remember thinking, ‘that is the coolest thing I’ve ever heard in my life’.”</p>

<div class="callout-box" style=" float: right; width: 50%; margin: 0 0 5px 10px;">
<p>“There’s something thrilling about seeing a child or family that is one of only a handful in the world, and perhaps you have knowledge that can help them in some way.”</p>
</div>

<p>As Dr. Stewart continued through medical school, he pursued work that fit his evolving interests. He credits a summer laboratory position with teaching him genetics, and later a rotation at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP) with introducing him to the world of clinical genetics. After completing a residency in internal medicine, Dr. Stewart again returned to CHOP for a clinical genetics fellowship in 2001.&#160;</p>

<p>“I came upon this career path sort of by serendipity,” Dr. Stewart said. “Looking back, it all makes sense. There’s a joke that in medicine you pick the field that suits your own pathology. I’d always been interested in trivia, rare facts, and unusual things. There’s something thrilling about seeing a child or family that is one of only a handful in the world, and perhaps you have knowledge that can help them in some way.”</p>

<p>After his CHOP fellowship in clinical genetics, Dr. Stewart joined the Physician Scientist Development Program at the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) in 2004. There, his research focused on neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a genetic disorder that features the growth of multiple cutaneous or subcutaneous tumors of peripheral nerves. In recognition for his work in NF1, he was named one of NIH’s first Earl Stadtman Investigators and joined DCEG’s Clinical Genetics Branch in the summer of 2010.</p>

<h3>Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)</h3>

<p>During his time at NHGRI, Dr. Stewart worked to identify genes that influenced or modified the severity of NF1.</p>

<p>“NF1 is a disease that’s been well known in medical science since the 1880s,” Dr. Stewart said. “Despite that, I’ve been pleasantly surprised to see what other discoveries could be made, especially in adults.”</p>

<p>Dr. Stewart and his colleague Dr. Eric Legius of Catholic University in Leuven, Belgium, published the first genetic, functional, and clinical evidence of an association between NF1 and painful tumors in the finger-tips known as glomus tumors.</p>

<p>Analyses of this cohort of 135 patients have yielded other novel insights, such as the identification of candidate modifier genes influencing the number of café-au-lait macules (flat, pigmented spots that are a clinical feature of NF1); the first genome-wide association study in NF1; and characterization of novel clinical features (phenotypes) in NF1, including its association with pulmonary hypertension.</p>

<p>Dr. Stewart has continued his NF1 research as a tenure-track investigator in DCEG and has several projects underway. Currently, the cohort is contributing to larger consortia efforts to find genetic modifiers of skin tumors and a type of brain tumor called optic pathway glioma.</p>

<p>In addition, Dr. Stewart is collaborating with Brigitte Widemann, M.D., of the NCI Center for Cancer Research, to sequence DNA from NF1 tumor biopsies to see how tumors differ in children who respond to certain drugs compared to those who do not. &#160;</p>

<p>“We’re excited because Dr. Widemann has found a drug that seems to work in a phase I trial to control the growth of plexiforms, which are precursor lesions,” Dr. Stewart said. “We’re now helping with the genomic component of the phase II trial.”</p>

<h3>Pleuropulmonary Blastoma (PPB)</h3>

<p>PPB is a rare tumor of the lung. Research has shown that PPB may be part of an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome caused by changes in a gene known as <i>DICER1</i>. Since 2011, Dr. Stewart and colleagues have recruited families to participate in a study to characterize the disorder. Recently, the research team developed a new <a href="http://ppb.cancer.gov/">PPB study website</a> to recruit new patients and families.&#160;</p>

<p>“I had never heard of PPB until I came to DCEG and started working with Dr. Christian Kratz, who initiated the study” Dr. Stewart said. “The <i>DICER1</i> gene had only been discovered a few years before; I was excited to utilize all of the wonderful tools that we have at NCI to bring to bear on such a rare disease.”</p>

<p>About two or three PPB families visit the Clinical Center each month to undergo a complete history, physical exam, lab work, imaging, and a variety of consultations. This gives investigators a complete picture of phenotypic and epidemiologic data of the PPB patients.&#160;</p>

<p>After a few years of recruiting, the study finally has enough participants for the investigators to do meaningful analyses. Ultimately, Dr. Stewart hopes to identify all of the variety of tumors associated with PPB and related medical problems. “We know something about the pediatric manifestations of people who have mutations in <i>DICER1</i>, but we don’t know much about the adults.”</p>

<h3>Opening up Genetic Cold Cases</h3>

<p>Over the past several decades, NCI has recruited families to the Clinical Center that appear to have an increased risk of cancer. In many cases, no underlying gene could be identified as the cause.</p>

<p>“Now, with the advent of exome sequencing, we can go back and see if we can find a gene in those families,” Dr. Stewart said. “I call these cold cases; they haven’t been fully solved (like in police detective work) and they’ve been sitting in the freezer for decades.”</p>

<p>Dr. Stewart and colleagues have been investigating a handful of families that first came to the Clinical Center in the 1970s. Because of NCI’s extensive records, investigators are able to put together 45 years of follow-up on these families and have successfully identified some genetic factors associated with risk.</p>

<p>“With the advent of exome sequencing, we can go back and see if we can find a gene in those families. I call these cold cases; they haven’t been fully solved (like in police detective work) and they’ve been sitting in the freezer for decades.”</p>
</div>

<p>“I would love to go through the NCI repository and comprehensively characterize more of these cold cases,” Dr. Stewart said. “It’s been a lot of fun to dig through the records and find photographs from the 70s, with 70s haircuts and clothing, all right there in the medical chart.”</p>

<p>Whether he’s looking at families or cohorts, studying rare childhood tumors or cold cases from the 1970s, Dr. Stewart is committed to characterizing rare variants that increase the risk for cancer.</p>

<p>“The gene hunting is the best part of the job,” Dr. Stewart said. “It’s a thrill to sit down with data that no one else has looked at, pick it apart, and find variants in genes that underlie some of these cancer susceptibility syndromes.”</p>

<p>Genetic epidemiologists in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics have been collaborating with investigators from the University of Milan in Italy to uncover the critical steps that lead to the development of lung cancer and identify opportunities to interrupt that progression. The population-based study in the northern Lombardy region combined elements that had never before been included together in a study of lung cancer: substantial population size; rigorous study design; detailed epidemiologic, clinical, behavioral, and occupational data; and exceptional tissue and biospecimen collection. The rich integrative platform of the Environment and Genetics in Lung Cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study resulted in extensive data on 2,100 lung cancer patients and over 2,100 healthy population-based controls.</p>
<p>By evaluating these data together, EAGLE investigators are able to draw conclusions not only about host and environmental risk factors, but also on the effect of those factors on the tumors themselves and the risk of local recurrence, distant metastasis, and survival.</p>

<p>The team selected the Lombardy region for its many unique features that make it well suited to this type of epidemiologic pursuit. A large proportion of the population smokes and lung cancer is common. In addition to tobacco, residents are exposed to other environmental factors known to influence lung cancer risk, particularly occupational exposures from manufacturing and farming, and air pollution. Further, Lombardy is served by a network of modern hospitals, medical schools, and a regional health service, which supported the recruitment effort. With the active involvement of hospital physicians, researchers were able to reduce participation biases.</p>
<p>As new cases were diagnosed and enrolled in the study, plans were in place to collect samples during initial surgical resection.

<p>&ldquo;We were in the operating rooms collecting multiple samples of the same tumors from each patient, as well as areas adjacent to the tumors, and those far distant,&rdquo; Dr. Landi said. &ldquo;In addition, we collected whole blood, serum, and buccal samples, and blood spots on Guthrie cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thanks to these efforts, EAGLE researchers were able to evaluate tumor, peritumor, and normal tissue for DNA and RNA, and complete integrated analyses of DNA sequencing, copy number aberration, gene expression and genome-wide methylation, features not possible in most studies. The blood specimens were transported to a central laboratory within four hours of collection to avoid the loss of certain analytes and degradation of RNA components. At the lab, they were processed in several ways to allow a variety of uses in future studies.</p>
<h3>How has EAGLE expanded our understanding of lung cancer etiology?</h3>
<p>Lung cancer is the largest single cause of cancer mortality worldwide. A deeper understanding of its etiology, from inception to outcome, is needed to improve treatment and prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Early work in EAGLE focused on exposure-based association studies. Investigators conducted a series of descriptive analyses, examining the role of occupational exposures, dietary components, infections, previous lung diseases, hormonal factors, and circulating immune markers in the etiology of lung cancer. They found increased lung cancer risk in association with several occupations, particularly those involving exposure to asbestos, silica, and nickel-chromium; frequent meat intake; and some previous lung diseases. Investigators believe that many of these lifestyle, host, and environmental factors can influence chronic inflammation, a known pathway for tumorigenesis. In contrast, quercetin-rich foods (fruits and vegetables), history of pneumonia or mood disorders, low alcohol intake, and endogenous hormones during premenopausal years were inversely associated with lung cancer risk. They are currently analyzing the influence of air pollution, using data from detailed exposure maps covering the entire region.</p>
<p>The vast quantities of samples and data from EAGLE allow investigators to study gene-environment interactions, rapidly replicate previous findings, and investigate potentially new associations.<br /> <br /> &ldquo;[Our study] is unique because we have the population, materials, and samples to study any idea or question we may have,&rdquo; Dr. Landi said. For example, DCEG fellow <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=72&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302407" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302407" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6469517">Guoqin Yu, Ph.D., M.S.</a>, and colleagues are currently exploring the role of microbiome in the lung, characterizing the typical bacteria found in histologically normal tissue from lung cancer patients.</p>
<p>EAGLE is also investigating how risk differs by histology and the genetic variations associated with specific histologic subtypes. Lung cancer is classified into two main groups: small cell and non-small cell. The latter includes adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large cell carcinoma, along with rarer subtypes. The different histologies have diverse molecular characteristics, which may reflect differences in carcinogenesis, etiology, and response to treatment.</p>

<p>For example, in a genome-wide methylation analysis, Dr. Landi together with <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349594" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349594" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6469518">Jianxin Shi, Ph.D.</a>, and colleagues, found that methylation patterns, and the inherited variations that influence them, strongly differentiate risk for various subtypes of non-small cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>Another genetic analysis provided the first evidence of inherited susceptibility to a distinct lung cancer subtype. In a study of 33,000 participants from EAGLE and other cohort studies, a single nucleotide polymorphism in the <i>TERT</i> region was associated with risk of adenocarcinoma but not squamous cell carcinoma or small cell lung cancer. Similarly, a pathway analysis of inflammation-related genes showed that the <i>RAD52</i> region was distinctly associated with squamous cell carcinoma risk. This finding was validated in three other study populations.</p>
<h3>How has EAGLE informed lung cancer screening, prevention, and treatment?</h3>
<p>Epidemiologic and other scientific investigations have clearly implicated tobacco smoking as the primary cause of lung cancer, accounting for ~80% of the worldwide burden in males and at least 50% in females. However, risk varies substantially among smokers; smoking intensity, duration, and cumulative exposure (pack-years) can affect risk.</p>
<p>In a recent report, Dr. Caporaso, <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=72&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302407" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302407" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6469519">Fangyi Gu, M.Med., Sc.D.</a>, and colleagues found that participants who are highly addicted to nicotine&ndash;those who smoke their first cigarette within five minutes after waking up in the morning&ndash;are at higher risk of developing lung cancer than those who wait for an hour or more to smoke. This simple measure of nicotine dependency improved lung cancer risk prediction beyond standard smoking measures, such as cigarettes per day and pack-years. These findings underscore the need for even light smokers to quit, because even light smokers who are, or who become dependent smokers, were observed to be at substantial risk for developing lung cancer.</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: right; width: 25%; margin: 0 0 5px 10px;">
<p>&ldquo;The idea is that you target smokers at highest risk, and use behavioral, biomarker, and genomic tools to refine a risk model to select screening candidates.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Ongoing and future work on disease progression within the EAGLE population is helping to address the clinical challenges of managing lung cancer patients. Recently, Dr. Landi, <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=18&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349622" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349622" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6469520">Mitchell H. Gail, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, and collaborators published results of an analysis of lung cancer prognosis, describing patterns of indicators for recurrence, metastases, and survival that may one day inform the treatment of patients. <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/lung-cancer-indicators-recurrence"><span class="hidden">Indicators related to lung cancer recurrence, metastases and survival can inform treatment of patients</span>Read more about these findings in the NCI News Note</a>.</p>
<p>In addition, EAGLE is contributing data to several consortia, including the International Lung Cancer Consortium (ILCCO) and the Transdisciplinary Research in Cancer of the Lung (TRICL) consortium. In a GWAS analysis with imputed data, Dr. Landi and TRICL collaborators identified a <i>BRCA2</i> variant associated with lung cancer risk. For a smoker carrying this variant (which occurs in about 2% of the population), the risk of developing lung cancer was approximately doubled, which may have implications for identifying high-risk subjects for lung cancer screening. Additionally, future study of the effects of PARP inhibition in smokers with lung cancer carrying this <i>BRCA2</i> variant may be warranted. Together with collaborators, EAGLE investigators are trying to identify additional highly predictive biomarkers. Ultimately they hope to design a risk prediction model utilizing the new markers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The idea is that you target smokers at highest risk, and use behavioral, biomarker, and genomic tools to refine a risk model to select screening candidates,&rdquo; Dr. Caporaso said.</p>
<h3>What&rsquo;s next for EAGLE?</h3>
<p>Is one lung tumor biopsy enough to define the cancer? The answer isn&rsquo;t clear to scientists or clinicians. Two recent studies published conflicting evidence, but both were from small studies. EAGLE investigators hope to add more evidence to the discussion by analyzing samples collected from multiple regions of the same tumor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we find the same mutations in every region, then one biopsy may be enough,&rdquo; Dr. Landi said. &ldquo;But, if there is heterogeneity, that is, different mutations, then one biopsy might not be enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>EAGLE investigators are also studying clonal evolution in lung cancer using their collection of tissue samples. &ldquo;We think it&rsquo;s important to understand the origin of the cancer,&rdquo; Dr. Landi said. &ldquo;If we know the most important mutations that occur in the initial cancerous cells, then potentially we can provide more targeted treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;EAGLE provides a superb framework for diverse studies and collaborative efforts to understand the etiology of lung cancer,&rdquo; said <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6469521">Stephen J. Chanock, M.D.</a>, DCEG Director. &ldquo;Our hope for the next wave of results&mdash;which will provide clues from next-generation sequencing, methylome, microbiome, metabolomics, and other approaches&mdash;is to provide additional insights to the critical questions for screening, prevention, and clinical management of this malignancy.&rdquo;</p>

During the last several years, Biostatistics Branch members <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349657" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7258751" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349657" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349657">Philip S. Rosenberg, Ph.D.</a> and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349669" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7258752" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349669" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349669">William F. Anderson, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, have developed sophisticated statistical models to analyze the complex, interrelated effects of age, time period, and birth cohort on cancer incidence trends for various cancer types in the U.S. The results of these age-period-cohort (APC) analyses have provided informative &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; clues about how cancer incidence and mortality trends change over time, what factors are driving them, and provide projections for future cancer burden.</p>
<p>But using the APC approach has challenges, particularly because of the statistical complexity, and because of the difficulty of implementing the model in common statistical software packages and interpreting the results. &nbsp;This has limited the use of the methodology within the broader scientific community. Over the last few years, Drs. Rosenberg and Anderson have shared their expertise in APC methods to help other investigators in DCEG and the extramural community describe<a href="#References"> incidence and mortality trends in the U.S. for lung cancer<sup>1</sup>, pancreatic cancer<sup>2</sup>, ovarian cancer<sup>3</sup>, and Burkitt lymphoma<sup>4</sup>, and global incidence rates of oral cavity cancers and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas<sup>5</sup> (see References)</a>.</p>
<p>Most recently, Drs. Rosenberg and Anderson used the APC model to forecast <a href="#References">breast cancer incidence rates and burden in 2030<sup>6</sup>(see References)</a>. &ldquo;We were able to incorporate recent birth cohort data in this analysis,&rdquo; stated Dr. Rosenberg, &ldquo;as well as breast cancer sub-type specific incidence data, which had not previously been done. We were able to show that the incidence trends of the future will not resemble the patterns we see today.&rdquo; Dr. Rosenberg presented the results at the American Association for Cancer Research Annual Meeting in April.</p>
<p>Through these collaborative efforts, Drs. Rosenberg and Anderson realized that it was important to make APC methods, and particularly the newer approaches, more accessible to researchers interested in evaluating disease trends. With the help of David Check, BB, and Sue Pan from NCI&rsquo;s Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT), Drs. Rosenberg and Anderson developed a <a href="http://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/apc/">free, open-access, web-based APC tool</a> available through the DCEG website. A <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25146089">description of the APC tool was recently published in <i>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention</i></a>.</p>
<p>The APC tool was designed to be intuitive and user friendly, and includes sample data for first-time users. Users input or &ldquo;paste&rdquo; their data into an open field on the site, and the tool does the rest.&nbsp;The available functions incorporate traditional and new approaches to APC analyses, which take into account various longitudinal and cross-sectional models and interpretations of the data. One of the most important features of the tool is its ability to easily calculate net drift, which is defined as the sum of the linear change in the period and cohort effects and is conceptually similar to the standard annual percentage change in the age-standardized rate.&nbsp;The tool also uniquely calculates local drifts, which show the estimated annual percentage change over time for individual age groups. This feature can often reveal striking age interaction over time, which is a signature consequence of underlying birth-cohort phenomena.</p>
<p>Another key feature of the tool is that its output summarizes the results in tables and graphs, which provide powerful illustrations of the analyses. The output files may be exported into a variety of different formats, such as Excel or the R statistical package. &ldquo;What previously required years of expertise by a trained statistician can now be done by anyone from any discipline in very little time,&rdquo; stated Dr. Anderson.</p>
<p>With funds awarded through the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=835255" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7258753" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="835255" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="835255">DCEG Informatics Tool Challenge</a>, Drs. Rosenberg and Anderson and Mr. Check and CBIIT colleagues will develop a companion tool that will conduct comparative APC analysis of &ldquo;two-hazard&rdquo; problems.&nbsp;For example, the new tool will allow the user to conduct two independent APC analyses using data from different populations for the same disease outcome and compare them. &ldquo;Developing this tool will be challenging,&rdquo; stated Dr. Rosenberg &ldquo;But we are excited to bring this additional tool to others so they can test their own unique hypotheses.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In June 2015, nearly 200 scientists from NCI, NIH, and other organizations gathered for the &ldquo;Applying NCI Etiologic Epidemiologic Discoveries to Reduce Cancer Burden&rdquo; symposium. The event, hosted by DCEG, targeted the etiologic epidemiologist considering the earliest steps of new discovery application.</p>
<p>Etiologic epidemiologists at NCI study the patterns, determinants and development of cancer. The successful identification of a causal agent or informative biomarker raises hopes of application to reduce cancer incidence and mortality, but a strong association does not necessarily mandate or assure application. The formal study of how best to apply such findings is not new, but methods are evolving and this topic merits increased collaborative attention from etiologists and translational researchers.</p>
<p>The symposium featured interactive, participatory sessions with ample time for questions from the audience. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349685" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349685" sys_relationshipid="7260406" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349685">Margaret A.

<p>Breast cancer mortality rates have been declining among women in many western countries since the 1970s. Overall, breast cancer survival rates following diagnosis have improved for all women diagnosed with local and regional (area around the tumor) disease. Women diagnosed before age 70 have experienced lower short-term (less than 5 years) death rates, even for metastatic disease. And the long-term death rates (survival beyond the first 5 years) have improved among those with local and regional disease in all age groups. Tumor size at diagnosis has shrunk since the 1980s, but new evidence shows that changes in tumor size within each stage at diagnosis explain only a small proportion of the improvement in breast cancer mortality in women under the age of 70. However, changes in tumor size account for about half of the improvements for women diagnosed with local or regional breast cancer at age 70 and older.</p>
<p>This conclusion comes from an analysis of data from NCI&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The study also found that changes in estrogen receptor (ER) status explain little of the improvement after adjustment for tumor size, except for women age 70 and older within 5 years after diagnosis. Results of this study, by Mitchell H. Gail, M.D., Ph.D., and William F. Anderson, M.D., both with the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and their colleague, Ju-Hyun Park, Ph.D., Dongguk University-Seoul, appeared online July 20, 2015, in the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i>. <a href="http://cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2015/changing-survival-patterns-breast">Read more about breast cancer survival trends in the full NCI News Note</a>.</p>

<p>Frederick Li and Joseph Fraumeni.</p>

<p>Dr. Li is perhaps most widely known for his contribution to the discovery of the cancer predisposition syndrome named for him and his collaborator, former DCEG Division Director <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/fraumeni-joseph">Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.</a> The two identified what came to be known as Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) from the study of a group of families with an unexpected constellation of tumors occurring at very young ages.</p>
<p>In 1990, using biological samples carefully collected from those families, colleagues of Li and Fraumeni discovered that germline mutations in the <i>TP53</i> tumor suppressor gene cause LFS. This finding aroused considerable interest in the condition, particularly since mutations of <i>TP53</i>, the so-called guardian of the genome, were known to occur in a high percentage of cancers in the general population. Dr. Li took the lead in planning the next generation of studies, which included organizing a series of workshops in which the syndrome served as a prototype for developing recommendations about predictive genetic testing and interventions in cancer-prone families.</p>
<p>Their first description of LFS families was published in 1969 in the <i>Annals of Internal Medicine</i>. The title of the article was &ldquo;Soft-tissue sarcomas, breast cancer, and other neoplasms: A familial syndrome?&rdquo; According to Dr. Fraumeni, the two spent more time debating the title than writing the paper, &ldquo;Fred thought we should be conservative and insert a question mark, and he prevailed. But he was more confident later that year when we presented more data in <i>The Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>. The paper was called &lsquo;Rhabdomyosarcoma in children: Epidemiologic study and identification of a familial cancer syndrome&rsquo; (with no question mark).&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reflecting upon his first meeting with Dr. Li, Dr. Fraumeni recalled, &ldquo;Fred was different from the many young physicians who were flocking to NIH at that time. His background in clinical medicine was matched by a passionate interest in public health. He seemed a natural for epidemiology, and his intellectual curiosity and productivity were evident from the very start.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In recognition of their discovery of LFS and the identification of the gene responsible, Li and Fraumeni were jointly awarded the Charles S. Mott General Motors Prize in 1995.</p>
<p>Among his many efforts at NCI, he successfully mapped a gene in kidney cancer families, identifying a chromosomal translocation associated with elevated risk for the disease. He was instrumental in launching the study of cancer survivorship, leading efforts on risk for second malignancies after childhood cancer. Dr. Li was a key member of the original Late Effects Study Group and later the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study. He also initiated the NCI Retinoblastoma Follow-up Study, a cohort of retinoblastoma survivors that DCEG investigators continue to follow.</p>
<p>As surprising as it may seem in today&rsquo;s era of precision medicine, which often relies on an analysis of genetic factors in the patient and in tumor tissue, at the time of the discovery of LFS genetics was outside mainstream cancer research, and family studies were on the fringe. During that period the research priority was on the study of tumor viruses. In addition, there was also a prevailing dogma that any familial tendencies to cancer were site-specific, so that families with different forms of cancer were thought to represent the play of chance, or referral bias, or possibly an environmental factor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fred had a knack for making important clinical and epidemiological observations, and taking them to the next level. This often meant overcoming the considerable challenge of bringing together experts from multiple disciplines. [We] were drawn not only to the scientific ideas he generated, but also by his friendly, calm, and thoughtful demeanor, as well as his generosity of spirit,&rdquo; said Dr. Fraumeni.</p>
<p>Dr. Li helped found a free clinic in Boston&rsquo;s Chinatown in the late 1960&rsquo;s where he worked for years. &ldquo;He was very concerned about social justice issues and felt it important to &lsquo;give back&rsquo; to those with fewer resources,&rdquo; said <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/tucker-margaret">Margaret Tucker, M.D.</a>, another of Dr. Li&rsquo;s DCEG collaborators. &ldquo;He was also involved in the early delegations to China, the &lsquo;opening up&rsquo; of U.S.-China relations, and helped to develop their cancer research programs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Dr. Li&rsquo;s career blossomed at Dana-Farber and Harvard, his focus extended to several other hereditary cancer syndromes, the study of late effects of cancer and its treatment, issues of cancer survivorship, preventive strategies in high-risk populations, and, more recently, cancer control research in Asian-American and other minority populations.</p>

<p>B.J. Stone, Ph.D., esteemed colleague in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics for 36 years, died August 29, 2015, three years after being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Dr. Stone was perhaps most well known for her superior talents as a scientific editor. Although she was a statistician and mathematician in the Biostatistics Branch, Dr. Stone was sought out by colleagues across the Division to consult on the writing of critical scientific manuscripts. She was a precise, creative and insightful analyst who developed novel solutions to difficult problems. With her extraordinary problem-solving skills, she also provided substantial testing of new computer programs and algorithms before their general release to other analysts. She participated as a co-author on many scientific papers as well. In 1991, Dr. Stone received the NIH Award of Merit and the NIH Director's Award in 1994.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone received her undergraduate degree with honors from Swarthmore College and her doctorate from Stanford University, both in mathematics. Prior to coming to NCI, Dr. Stone worked in the private sector, including stints at the RAND Corporation and the National Planning Association. From 1967-68, she taught mathematics at Harvey Mudd College in Pomona, California.</p>
<p>After her retirement from NCI in 2010, Dr. Stone and her husband relocated to California where she became a cherished member of the La Costa Glen retirement community.&nbsp;While there she sang in several different choral groups, regularly had singing, dancing and speaking roles in the La Costa Glen theatre performances, led community sing-alongs and participated in several book clubs.</p>
<p>Dr. Stone&rsquo;s DCEG colleagues, as well as friends from all aspects of her life, remember her as exceptionally compassionate, generous with her talents, sensible, and quite unflappable.</p>

<p>This repository will facilitate the reuse of code, improving the efficiency and quality assurance of programming tasks performed by DCEG fellows and investigators, and enhancing integration among working groups. By re-using code, programmers will be able to reduce redundancy by taking advantage of assets that have already been created in some form by others.</p>
<h4>SOCAssign: Companion Software to Aid Expert Coders in Manual Review of Standardized Occupation Codes Assigned by SOCcer, a Computerized Coding Algorithm</h4>
<p><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349680" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7259129" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349680" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349680"><i>Melissa Friesen</i></a><i> (DCEG); Sue Pan, Carl McCabe (CBIIT); Daniel Russ, Calvin Johnson (NIH/CIT)</i></p>
<p>To facilitate the incorporation of occupational risk factors into large-scale epidemiological studies, DCEG recently developed the SOCcer algorithm (http://soccer.nci.nih.gov), which automatically assigns standardized occupation classification codes based on job descriptions. Manual review of some SOCcer-assigned codes remains necessary, however, and the SOCAssign companion tool will aid coders in selecting appropriate occupation codes during this manual review. SOCAssign will be made freely available for download to users of the SOCcer website.</p>

<p>Researchers from DCEG&rsquo;s Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, DCCPS, and DCP will enhance the data transfer and security capabilities of the &ldquo;Life in a Day&rdquo; smartphone application for collecting exposure-related information reported by participants in epidemiological studies. DCCPS and DCP researchers developed &ldquo;Life in a Day&rdquo; to collect information on daily risk factor-related activity, but the original application required users to manually email data files to investigators following study completion. The enhanced version will automatically authenticate and transfer data from the mobile user to an NCI exchange portal over a secure network connection.</p>

<h4>Gene-Environment Interaction</h4>
<p>Investigators observed a significant additive interaction between a known bladder cancer susceptibility genetic variant (rs798766:<em>TMEM129</em>-<em>TACC3</em>-<em>FGFR3</em>) and occupational exposure to straight metalworking fluids in a study of high-risk occupations for 2,258 case patients and 2,410 control patients from two bladder cancer studies. The interaction was more apparent in patients with tumors positive for FGFR3 expression. <span>(Figueroa JD</span>, Koutros S, Colt JS, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26374428">Modification of occupational exposures on bladder cancer risk by common genetic polymorphisms</a>. <em>J&nbsp;Natl Cancer Inst</em> 2015; Epub Sep 14)</p>

<h4>Red and Processed Meat</h4>
<p>High consumption of red meat and processed meat was associated with an increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer in an analysis of 9,305 breast cancer cases from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Added nitrite and heme iron may partly contribute to these observed associations. (Inoue-Choi M, Sinha R, Gierach GL, Ward MH. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26505173">Red and processed meat, nitrite, and heme iron intakes and postmenopausal breast cancer risk in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2015; Epub Oct 27)</p>

<h4>HPV Typing and Cervical Cancer Screening&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In U.S. cervical cancer screening, immediate colposcopy is recommended for women with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive ASC-US (equivocal) cytology. This study demonstrated a type-dependent 10-fold range in 3-year risks of CIN 3+ for women whose screening result was HPV-positive ASC-US. The findings suggest those with high risk (16.0%) should have immediate colposcopy while low risk (2.0%) might be better managed with repeat testing at 1&nbsp;year. ASC-US linked to HPV types 16, 18, 31, or 33/58 was considered high risk, warranting immediate colposcopy. Optimal management of women with HPV 52 or 45 remains uncertain. Risk for women with HPV 51, 39, 68/35, or 59/56/66 might be low enough to recommend one-year retesting. (Schiffman M, Vaughan LM, Raine-Bennett TR, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26148763">A study of HPV typing for the management of HPV-positive ASC-US cervical cytologic results.</a> <em>Gynecol Oncol</em> 2015;138:573-578)</p>
<h4>p16/Ki-67 Dual Stain Cytology</h4>
<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV)-based cervical cancer screening requires triage markers to decide who should be referred to colposcopy. Based on data from a cohort of women who participated in the HPV/cytology cotesting program at Kaiser Permanente California, the p16/Ki-67 dual stain cytology showed good risk stratification for all HPV-positive women and for HPV-positive women with normal cytology. Additional follow-up is needed to determine how long dual stain negative women remain at low risk of precancer. (Wentzensen N, Fetterman B, Castle PE, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26376685">p16/Ki-67 dual stain cytology for detection of cervical precancer in HPV-positive women.</a> <em>J Natl Cancer Inst</em> 2015; Epub Sep 15)</p>

<h4>Etiologic Factors in Relation to Prognosis</h4>
<p>A study of endometrial cancer patients in the NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group 210 trial demonstrated that etiologic risk factors, particularly age at diagnosis and body mass index, were associated with tumor-subtype-specific prognosis. (Felix AS, Scott McMeekin D, Mutch D, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26341710">Associations between etiologic factors and mortality after endometrial cancer diagnosis: The NRG Oncology/Gynecologic Oncology Group 210 trial</a>. <em>Gynecol Oncol</em> 2015;139:70-76)</p>

<h3 id="Esophageal-Cancer">Esophagus</h3>
<h4>Age-Specific Risk Factor Profiles</h4>
<p>Investigators pooled data from eight population-based, case-control studies within the international Barrett's and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium (BEACON) to evaluate age-specific risk factor profiles for esophageal (EA) and esophagogastric junction (EGJA) adenocarcinoma. Body mass index (BMI), smoking status and pack-years, recurrent gastroesophageal reflux, and frequency of gastroesophageal reflux were positively associated with EA and EGJA in each age group. Early-onset EA (&lt;50 years) had stronger associations with recurrent gastroesophageal reflux and BMI, relative to older age groups. In contrast, inverse associations of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs use were strongest in the oldest age group (&ge;70 years). Age-specific associations with EGJA showed similar, but slightly weaker patterns. (Drahos J, Xiao Q, Risch HA. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26175109"> Age-specific risk factor profiles of adenocarcinomas of the esophagus: A pooled analysis from the international BEACON consortium.</a> <i>Int J Cancer</i> 2015; Epub Jul 14)</p>

<h4>Oral Biphosphonate Use</h4>
<p>Investigators observed no association between oral bisphosphonate use and esophageal cancer risk in a study of the Kaiser Permanente Northern California population. However, a significant association was detected with gastric cardia adenocarcinoma risk.

<h4>Gene-Gene Interactions</h4>
<p>Meta-analysis combining different genotyping platforms can increase power to assess gene-gene interactions but requires a test for interaction on untyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). The author describes a novel Wald-type method for testing gene-gene interaction on marginally imputed values of untyped SNPs that corrects for the uncertainty in imputation through the variance estimator using the jackknife, one of resampling techniques. Simulation studies and real data analysis demonstrate that the authors&rsquo; approaches outperform the application of traditional dosage method to detection of gene-gene interaction in terms of power while providing control of the type I error. (Song M. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26187382">Jackknife-based gene-gene interaction tests for untyped SNPs.</a> <i>BMC Genet</i> 2015;16:85)</p>
<h4>Heritability and Genetic Correlation Attributable to SNPs</h4>
<p>Using data from previous genome-wide association studies for cancer at 13 anatomical sites, investigators estimated the heritability of individual cancers and genetic correlation between pairs as well as the contribution of the heritability of smoking behaviors to the heritability of cancer. Esophageal, prostate, and testicular cancers had the highest heritable components while genetic correlation between pairs of cancer was modest. Smoking heritability contributed more to the heritability of lung than bladder cancer. (Sampson JN, Wheeler WA, Yeager M, et al.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26464424">Analysis of heritability and shared heritability based on genome-wide association studies for thirteen cancer types.</a> <em>J Natl Cancer Inst </em>2015; Epub Oct 12)</p>
<h4>Somatic Mutation in Cancer Susceptibility Regions</h4>
<p>Researchers observed only limited evidence that cancer susceptibility regions that harbor common alleles with small estimated effect sizes are preferential targets for altered somatic mutation frequencies. The findings suggest a complex interplay between germline susceptibility and somatic mutation, underscoring the cumulative effect of common variants on redundant pathways as opposed to driver genes. (Machiela MJ, Ho BM, Fisher VA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26374197">Limited evidence that cancer susceptibility regions are preferential targets for somatic mutation.</a> <em>Genome Biol</em> 2015;16:193 doi:10.1186/s13059-015-0755-5)</p>
<h4>Web-based Application to Assess Linkage Disequilibrium</h4>
<p>LDlink is a web-based collection of bioinformatic modules that query single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in population groups of interest to generate haplotype tables and interactive plots to assess linkage disequilibrium (LD). Phase 3 haplotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project are referenced for calculating pairwise metrics of LD, searching for proxies in high LD, and enumerating all observed haplotypes. LDlink is tailored for investigators interested in mapping common and uncommon disease susceptibility loci by focusing on output linking correlated alleles and highlighting putative functional variants. LDlink is free and publically available at <a href="http://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink/">http://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink/</a>. (Machiela MJ, Chanock SJ. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26139635">LDlink: A web-based application for exploring population-specific haplotype structure and linking correlated alleles of possible functional variants.</a> <i>Bioinformatics</i> 2015; Epub Jul 2)</p>

<h4>Effect of HPV Vaccine on Miscarriage</h4>
<p>Data from the NCI Costa Rica Human Papillomavirus (HPV) Vaccine Trial showed no evidence that bivalent HPV vaccination affects the risk of miscarriage for pregnancies conceived less than 90 days from vaccination. An increased risk observed for miscarriages at weeks 13-20 of gestation for pregnancies conceived any time after vaccination may be an artifact of a thorough set of sensitivity analyses, but should be explored further in existing and future studies. (Panagiotou OA, Befano BL, Gonzalez P, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26346155">Effect of bivalent human papillomavirus vaccination on pregnancy outcomes: Long term observational follow-up in the Costa Rica HPV Vaccine Trial.</a> <em>BMJ</em> 2015;<span>351:h4358).

<h4>HPV Typing and Cervical Cancer Screening&nbsp;&nbsp;</h4>
<p>In U.S. cervical cancer screening, immediate colposcopy is recommended for women with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive ASC-US (equivocal) cytology. This study demonstrated a type-dependent 10-fold range in 3-year risks of CIN 3+ for women whose screening result was HPV-positive ASC-US. The findings suggest those with high risk (16.0%) should have immediate colposcopy while low risk (2.0%) might be better managed with repeat testing at 1&nbsp;year. ASC-US linked to HPV types 16, 18, 31, or 33/58 was considered high risk, warranting immediate colposcopy. Optimal management of women with HPV 52 or 45 remains uncertain. Risk for women with HPV 51, 39, 68/35, or 59/56/66 might be low enough to recommend one-year retesting. (Schiffman M, Vaughan LM, Raine-Bennett TR, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26148763">A study of HPV typing for the management of HPV-positive ASC-US cervical cytologic results.</a> <em>Gynecol Oncol</em> 2015;138:573-578)</p>

<h4>Benzene</h4>
<p>A 28-year follow-up of 73,789 Chinese benzene-exposed workers and 34,504 unexposed workers demonstrated increased risks among the exposed workers for a broad range of myeloid and lymphoid neoplasms, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases, and suggested possible associations with other malignant and non-malignant disorders. (Linet MS, Yin SN, Gilbert ES, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25944549">A retrospective cohort study of cause-specific mortality and incidence of hematopoietic malignancies in Chinese benzene-exposed workers</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2015;137:2184-2197)</p>
<h4>Formaldehyde Exposure and Immune/Inflammation Markers</h4>
<p>Formaldehyde has been classified as a human myeloid leukemogen. However, the mechanistic basis for this association is still debated. Measurements of serum levels of 38 immune/inflammation markers in a cross-sectional study of 43 formaldehyde-exposed and 51 unexposed factory workers in Guangdong, China, demonstrated significantly lower circulating levels of two markers among exposed factory workers compared with unexposed controls, which suggests immunosuppression among formaldehyde-exposed workers.

<h4>Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</h4>
<p>The Liver Cancer Pooling Project, based on ten U.S.-based prospective cohort studies, showed an inverse association between aspirin use and liver cancer, which was stronger for users who reported daily use, longer duration use, and lower dosage. Aspirin use was also associated with a reduced risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma among men, but not women. The data suggest the merit of future intervention studies of aspirin and other agents that affect chronic inflammatory pathways for hepatocellular carcinoma and possibly intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

<h4>Fertility Drugs</h4>
<p>A cohort study of approximately 10,000 women evaluated for infertility showed a significant association of clomiphene citrate treatment with risk of melanoma and a nonsignificant association with thyroid cancer risk. Gonadotropins were not related to risk of any of the assessed cancers.

<h4>Test for Genetic Associations Integrating Environmental Risk Factors</h4>
<p>Investigators developed a test for genetic association, encompassing a broad range of risk models, including linear, logistic, and probit, for specifying joint effects of genetic and environmental exposures. Test statistics were obtained by maximizing over a class of score tests, each of which involves modified standard tests of genetic association through a weight function. This weight function reflects the potential heterogeneity of the genetic effects by levels of environmental exposures under a particular model.

<h4>Leptin</h4>
<p>Adiposity is associated with pancreatic cancer; however, the underlying mechanism(s) is uncertain. Leptin is an adipokine involved in metabolic regulation, and obese individuals have higher concentrations. In a pooled, nested case-control study of participants in three cohorts, prediagnostic serum leptin was not associated with pancreatic cancer overall, but there was a significant interaction by follow-up time, such that elevated risk was apparent only during follow-up of more than 10 years after blood draw.

<h3 id="Pesticides">Pesticides</h3>
<h4>Organophosphates and Hormonally-Related Cancers</h4>
<p>Personal use of organophosphate insecticides (OP) by female spouses of pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study was associated with an elevated risk of breast cancer. Malathion, the most commonly reported OP, was associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer and decreased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Diazinon use was associated with ovarian cancer. These results suggest potential for hormonally-mediated effects. (Lerro CC, Koutros S, Andreotti G, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26150671">Organophosphate insecticide use and cancer incidence among spouses of pesticide applicators in the Agricultural Health Study</a>. <em>Occup Environ Med </em>2015;72:736-744)</p>
<h4>Relative Telomere Length</h4>
<p>Researchers analyzed associations between occupational pesticide use reported at three time points and relative telomere length (RTL) in the Agricultural Health Study (AHS), a prospective cohort study of pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina. Cumulative and more recent use of certain pesticides was linked to alterations in RTL, which may be a potential intermediate in cancer. The strongest association was for 2, 4-D and shorter telomere length, which was borderline significant after accounting for multiple comparisons.

<h4>Cooperation of Oncogene and Susceptibility Variants</h4>
<p>Findings from a recent genome-wide association study of Ewing sarcoma, followed by targeted germline deep sequencing, gene expression studies, and other functional assays, established cooperation between a dominant oncogene and a susceptibility variant that regulates a major driver of Ewing sarcomagenesis. (Gr&uuml;newald TG, Bernard V, Gilardi-Hebenstreit P, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26214589">Chimeric EWSR1-FLI1 regulates the Ewing sarcoma susceptibility gene <em>EGR2</em> via a GGAA microsatellite</a>. <em>Nat Genet</em> 2015;47:1073-1078)</p>

<h4>Rising Rates among Hispanics</h4>
<p>Examination of racial/ethnic-specific incidence rates for testicular germ cell tumors between 1998 and 2011 from 39 U.S. cancer registries shows that the highest rates are among non-Hispanic whites, followed by Hispanics, American Indians/Alaska Natives, Asians/Pacific Islanders, and non-Hispanic blacks. The greatest increase in incidence was experienced by Hispanics.

<h3 id="Transplantation">Transplantation</h3>
<h4>Circulating Growth Factors and Organ Transplantation</h4>
<p>Transplant recipients have elevated cancer risk, perhaps partly due to direct carcinogenic effects of immunosuppressive medications. Experimental evidence indicates that calcineurin inhibitors given to transplant recipients increase cellular expression of transforming growth factor &beta;1 (TGF-&beta;1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which could promote cancer. A case-control study of nonmelanoma skin cancer and cancers of the lung, kidney, and colorectum, nested in a cohort of liver recipients, was conducted to evaluate these pathways. TGF-&beta;1 and VEGF levels were increased in association with lung cancer among transplant recipients, which may be explained by increased platelet counts and platelet degranulation in lung cancer cases. (Engels EA, Jennings L, Kemp TJ, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25919050">Circulating TGF-&beta;1 and VEGF and risk of cancer among liver transplant recipients</a>. <em>Cancer Med </em>2015;4:1252-1257)</p>
<h4>Sirolimus Treatment after Kidney Transplant</h4>
<p>Sirolimus, an immunosuppressant option for kidney transplant recipients, may reduce cancer risk by interrupting the mammalian target of rapamycin pathway. A meta-analysis of twenty clinical trials and two observational studies showed that sirolimus use was associated with lower overall cancer incidence, driven by a reduction in incidence of nonmelanoma skin cancer. Sirolimus use was also associated with lower kidney cancer incidence and higher prostate cancer incidence. (Yanik EL, Siddiqui K, Engels EA. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26108799">Sirolimus effects on cancer incidence after kidney transplantation: A meta-analysis</a>. <em>Cancer Med</em> 2015;4:1448-1459)</p>

<p>As a senior investigator in REB, Dr. Inskip led high-impact research on second cancers after childhood cancer, including a study on risk of breast cancer and central nervous system tumors following radiation treatment in the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS). He also served on the steering committee for the CCSS.</p>
<p>In addition, he initiated a comprehensive case-control study of brain tumors in adults. Dr. Inskip and collaborators evaluated a large number of possible environmental and genetic causes of brain tumors, including the first-ever analysis of the possible effects of cellular telephones. The study provided key data demonstrating a reduced risk of glioma among persons with a history of allergies and other immune disorders. He also studied cancer incidence among Chernobyl clean-up workers in Baltic countries.</p>
<p>Dr. Inskip&rsquo;s contributions to REB include his deep methodologic expertise and generous mentoring.</p>
<p>Dr. Inskip received a Sc.D. in epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health in 1989, after which he joined NCI as a fellow. He left NCI in 1995 to accept a position as Associate Professor of Epidemiology in the College of Veterinary Medicine at Texas A&amp;M University. Dr. Inskip returned to NCI as an investigator in 1998 and was appointed senior investigator in 2004.</p>

"He will be greatly missed by all of us. He was a special colleague and friend to so many."</p>
<p>Dr. Wacholder leaves behind a legacy of research excellence in genetic epidemiology that is both diverse and remarkably deep. A statistician by training, he was sought out by colleagues across the Division to advise on critical methodological and analytic components of nearly all major undertakings of the Division over the past 30 years, exploring the causes of cancer from natural history studies through clinical trials. He had a keen sense of the underlying biological questions and succeeded in helping the rest of us to become smarter and better informed. His breadth ranged from studies of risk factors to the application of new technologies to investigate the heritable component of different cancers.</p>
<h4>Human Papillomavirus</h4>
<p>He was the lead statistician for the NCI study of the natural history of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cancer, culminating in the launch and successful completion of the NCI Costa Rica HPV Vaccine Trial. Dr. Wacholder spoke about his contributions to this body of work in a video titled "<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1410&amp;sys_contentid=1010856" sys_contentid="1010856" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1410" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1010856" sys_relationshipid="7275536" sys_variantid="1410">In their own words: Dr. Sholom Wacholder</a>," completed in 2010.</p>

</ul>
<h4>Genetics</h4>
<p>Dr. Wacholder began working in genetic epidemiology with the Washington Ashkenazi Study, and was one of the first to develop kin-cohort analysis, a novel sampling approach to eliminate statistical bias from studies of genetically similar populations. He was a key statistical consultant and analyst of the Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS) project from its inception, thereby laying the foundation for the many disease-specific genome-wide association studies conducted over the past decade.</p>

</ul>
<p>His interest in childhood cancers led him to research on electromagnetic fields and childhood acute lymphocytic leukemia, and later to pursue the inheritance of osteogenic sarcoma, a cancer that targets adolescents and young adults. He was also a key collaborator on large, comprehensive case-control studies of lung cancer and renal cell cancer.</p>
<h4>Methods</h4>
<p>He made many major contributions to the methodologic rigor of the Division's work, including the following highlights: the design of case-control studies, including a series of papers on choosing controls; the contribution of underlying population substructure to error in association studies; and a formal method for evaluating the chance that a reported positive finding is a false positive by incorporating external information.</p>

</ul>
<p>Dr. Wacholder was a marvelous teacher. His capacity to carefully and thoughtfully construct arguments, usually based on his &ldquo;first principles&rdquo;, was boundless. His wisdom was sought by all in the Division, particularly in the design and analysis of new cancer epidemiology studies. He served as an enthusiastic mentor to countless doctoral and post-doctoral students, always generous with his time. In this, he emulated his father, a remarkable scholar and teacher. In eulogizing his father in 2011, Dr. Wacholder reflected on the elder&rsquo;s imperative to &ldquo;teach these words to your sons&mdash;every waking hour of every day;&rdquo; the Judaic &lsquo;mitzvah&rsquo; applies to teaching Torah, but in the Wacholder household&mdash;of both generations&mdash;this good and necessary deed extended to science, history, philosophy and math. Roaming the halls of DCEG or sequestered in his office surrounded by stacks of papers, Dr. Wacholder constantly sought to teach those around him, engaging his peers as well as support staff in debates over scientific and philosophical approaches to the work at hand.</p>
<p>Dr. Wacholder received a Ph.D. in biomathematics from the University of Washington in 1982. He was a Fellow of the American Statistical Association and an elected member of the American Epidemiological Society.&nbsp;He served on the editorial boards of numerous journals, including <i>Epidemiology</i>, <i>Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers and Prevention</i>, <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>, and the <i>American Journal of Epidemiology</i>.</p>
<p>He is survived by his wife, Michelle, their two adult sons, Aaron and Jonah, his sisters and brother, and many nieces and nephews.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators have been evaluating the etiology of NHL for many years. As the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer in the U.S., NHL comprises a group of related diseases of the lymph system. There are more than 30 biologically and clinically distinct subtypes of NHL, and treatment is largely determined by the particular subtype. Researchers have suspected there might be both etiologic similarities and differences among the various subtypes that could inform the search for risk factors and help understand genetic susceptibility for this complex disease. However, previous studies investigating common genetic variants have been limited in size and scope.</p>

DNA samples from approximately 9,000 NHL cases and 3,000 controls were scanned at NCI and made available for analysis. In addition, several extramural studies contributed data from their scans.</p>

<p>To date, the team has reported 27 novel independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for four NHL subtypes, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), follicular lymphoma (FL), and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), with only a small amount of overlap in these findings across lymphoma subtypes.</p>

<h3>A Path to Discovery</h3>

<p>Previous work has led the way for the present large-scale initiative. Early candidate gene approaches suggested some genetic variants were associated with multiple NHL subtypes or NHL as a whole, while others were likely limited to particular subtypes.</p>

<p>Consistent with this hypothesis, the first GWAS for CLL and FL reported distinct loci, underscoring the value of assessing specific subtypes. However, these studies were limited in sample size.</p>

<p>“Our initial pooled candidate gene studies and long history of successful collaboration within InterLymph laid the foundation for the NHL GWAS, which is the largest and most comprehensive attempt to date to understand the genetic basis of NHL and how it interacts with the environment,” said Dr. Rothman.</p>

<p>Results from the effort have been enlightening. As noted, although each NHL subtype showed a pattern of mostly distinct associations, there were some associations that were shared across subtypes, with either the same SNP or different SNPs in the same locus showing association.</p>

<p>“Our findings of both shared and distinct genetic risk are consistent with the results for non-genetic risk factors in the InterLymph Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Subtypes Project,” Dr. Berndt said. (See Linkage article <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_revision=18&amp;sys_contentid=911461&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="911461" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6043985">“Probing the Complexity of Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Subtypes—A Consortial Effort”</a>).</p>

<p>Perhaps most notable, investigators discovered genetic variants in one or more human leukocyte antigen (HLA) regions were associated with CLL, DLBCL, FL, and MZL. HLA regions include several key immune response genes, which highlights the critical role that alterations in the immune system play in lymphomagenesis.</p>

<p>CLL/SLL has been shown to have a strong familial component. Investigators identified 10 independent SNPs in 9 novel loci for CLL, as well as one new independent SNP at a previously established locus (Berndt, 2013). These findings almost doubled the number of risk loci for CLL.</p>

<h4>Follicular Lymphoma</h4>

<p>Investigators reported five non-HLA loci associated with FL risk (Skibola, 2014). In addition, they showed striking evidence of very strong signals for FL across multiple HLA regions. These findings substantially expanded the number of loci associated with FL and provided evidence that multiple common variants outside as well as within the HLA region make a significant contribution to FL risk.</p>

<h4>Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphoma</h4>

<p>DLBCL is the most common lymphoma subtype and is clinically aggressive. With the discovery of four new loci, investigators provided new evidence for genetic susceptibility to DLBCL and point to immune pathways in the pathogenesis of DLBCL (Cerhan, 2014).</p>

<h4>Marginal Zone Lymphoma</h4>

<p>Two independent SNPS in the HLA region were associated with MZL risk, providing the first evidence for inherited susceptibility to MZL, and a role for genetic variation in the HLA region (Vijai, 2015).</p>

<h3>Future Efforts</h3>

<p>Drs. Berndt, Rothman, and collaborators continue to search for novel genetic variants associated with NHL. They are extending their work to include scanning of less common subtypes, such as mantle cell lymphoma, T cell lymphoma, and together with investigators in the Genetic Epidemiology Branch (<a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_revision=9&amp;sys_contentid=349591&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349591" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="6043986">Neil E.

<p>However, research goals extend beyond the discovery of new loci. Investigators are coordinating the use of the GWAS data across multiple institutions to support more than 20 intramural and extramural projects, including studies of gene-environment interactions, genetic mosaicism, the contribution to telomere length, and application of new methods of genomic analyses.</p>

<p>“Although we have discovered numerous variants associated with the risk of specific subtypes, the causal variants underlying these associations are unknown,” Dr. Berndt said. Plans are underway to conduct a number of secondary analyses to further elucidate the genetic architecture of NHL and pinpoint the functional variants contributing to disease.</p>

<p>In addition, investigators are evaluating potential genetic modifiers of established risk factors, taking advantage of previous data harmonization efforts. “Ongoing and future studies combining data on occupational and environmental exposures, lifestyle factors, medical history, and genetic risks promise to lead to further insight into this complex set of diseases,” said Dr. Rothman.</p>

<p>In October 2015, Michael C. R. Alavanja, Dr.P.H., retired after more than 30 years with NCI. Dr. Alavanja is a leading expert in environmental and occupational epidemiology, particularly recognized for his work to identify pesticide exposures that may be responsible for excess cancer risk among farmers. He was a senior investigator in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) and a member of the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS) (retired in 2008).</p>
<p>Dr. Alavanja played an important role in the design and conduct of the <a href="http://aghealth.nih.gov/">Agricultural Health Study</a> (AHS), a large prospective cohort study of cancer and other health outcomes among pesticide applicators and their spouses from Iowa and North Carolina. In collaboration with investigators from DCEG, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), Dr. Alavanja initiated AHS in 1993 with the goal of answering important questions about how agricultural, lifestyle and genetic factors affect the health of farming populations. Findings from AHS have provided key evidence used by regulatory agencies to determine whether specific pesticides cause cancer. In 1999, Dr. Alavanja received the U.S. PHS Meritorious Service Medal in recognition for his efforts and leadership of the study.</p>
<p>In addition to his work on AHS, Dr. Alavanja conducted a series of population-based, case-control studies of lung cancer among smoking and non-smoking women. These efforts identified a number of new etiologic associations. For example, investigators detected a significant exposure-response between lung cancer risk and residential radon at levels commonly found in North American and European homes.</p>
<p>Dr. Alavanja received a Dr.P.H. from the Columbia University School of Public Health. Prior to joining NCI, he served as an assistant professor of Environmental Health and Epidemiology at Hunter College School of Health Sciences and as an epidemiologist and section chief at NIOSH. In 1983, Dr. Alavanja joined NCI as a special assistant for epidemiology in the Office of the Associate Director for the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, and in 1996, he transferred to OEEB.</p>
<p>Dr. Alavanja has received a number of awards throughout his career, including the Outstanding Service Medal for work in quantitative risk assessment of environmental carcinogens, and two Commendation Medals, one for research on environmental causes of cancer and the other for studies of lung cancer etiology. He has received additional awards from the U.S. EPA, the NIH, and the U.S. PHS. Dr. Alavanja was a member of the NCI Intramural Advisory Board and is a Fellow of the American College of Epidemiology, serving on its membership committee.</p>

<p>Women in a clinical trial who became pregnant after vaccination with a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine did not have an increased risk of miscarriage compared with women who were not exposed to the vaccine, according to a new analysis of additional data from a clinical trial conducted in Costa Rica.</p>
<p>The trial evaluated the efficacy of a vaccine manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline that is now sold as Cervarix. This vaccine is known as a bivalent HPV vaccine because it protects against infection with two HPV types, 16 and 18. Together, these types cause most (about 70 percent) cervical cancers and some other anogenital and head and neck cancers.</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration has approved three vaccines to protect against infection with types of HPV that can cause cancer. Because the vaccines may be given to women of reproductive age, any effect of HPV vaccines on the ability to carry a pregnancy to term would be a concern.</p>
<p>In the new analysis, the researchers assessed the risk of miscarriage among close to 10,000 young adult women who were part of the NCI Costa Rica HPV Vaccine Trial and the trial&rsquo;s extended follow-up. In the clinical trial, nearly 7,500 women had been randomly assigned to receive the bivalent HPV vaccine or a control vaccine (hepatitis A vaccine). The trial researchers also looked at pregnancy outcomes in a group of more than 2,800 unvaccinated women who were not part of the original randomized trial.</p>
<p>The observational study, led by <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/bb-fellows#Panagiotou">Orestis Panagiotou, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Sholom Wacholder, Ph.D., and collaborators in Costa Rica and from the National Cancer Institute, appeared September 7 in the British Medical Journal. <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2015/hpv-vaccine-risk-miscarriage">Read more in the NCI Cancer Currents Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Vaccination against high-risk types of human papillomavirus (HPV) protected young women from infection with these HPV types at the cervix, anus, and oropharynx&mdash;the three primary anatomic sites where persistent HPV infections can cause cancer. The multi-site protection also was observed, though at lower levels, in women previously exposed to the virus.</p>
<p>The findings are among the latest to emerge from the HPV Vaccine Trial in Costa Rica, which was launched a decade ago by NCI, in collaboration with researchers in Costa Rica, to test the efficacy of the bivalent HPV vaccine&nbsp;Cervarix in preventing cervical HPV and pre-cancer in women vaccinated between the ages of 18 to 25.</p>
<p>Previous reports from the trial have demonstrated that the vaccine is highly effective in preventing HPV infections in the cervix, anus, or mouth&mdash;especially among women not infected prior to vaccination&mdash;when these sites were looked at separately.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first study to analyze multi-site protection,&rdquo; explained the lead author on the study, Daniel C. Beachler, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics.</p>

<p>Gloria M. Petersen, Ph.D., Professor of Epidemiology at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Associate Director for Population Sciences Research, Mayo Clinic Cancer Center, gave a DCEG Visiting Scholar lecture in October 2015. Her talk was titled &ldquo;Recent advances in genetics and risk assessment of pancreatic cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In her lecture, Dr. Petersen shared her experience searching for genetic risk factors for pancreatic cancer. Throughout her talk she highlighted the importance of investigating germline mutations as well as tumor characteristics and genetic signatures in addition to classical epidemiological factors. In her population of high-risk families at the Mayo Clinic and through consortial efforts, Dr. Petersen tests for established genes for familial pancreatic cancer, as well as searches for new loci of interest. Her in-depth discussion of etiologic investigations using cutting-edge genetic epidemiological methods began with a captivating story of a patient.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To illustrate the real-world challenges of this work, she described a clinical case from one of the families in her study. Several members of this large, extended family presented with disease. Genetic studies revealed a specific mutation among the cases. Testing offered to the rest of the family revealed the presence of the high-risk variant among one of the clinically unaffected children. Newly informed of their carrier status, this individual made the unprecedented decision&mdash;despite extensive counseling and education by the medical team&mdash;to undergo a radical prophylactic pancreatectomy, choosing life-long surgery-induced diabetes instead of a possible pancreatic cancer diagnosis in the future. She also discussed some of the bioethical considerations when researchers inform members of pancreatic cancer families of incidental genetic research findings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Petersen went on to discuss her efforts to amass a biobank of tumor specimens at the Mayo Clinic, and the promise such a repository creates for future studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Petersen&rsquo;s pioneering work leads us to think deeply about how advances in genetic research may inform precision cancer prevention in the future,&rdquo; said <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=43&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349595" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349595" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260651" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349595">Laufey Amundadottir, Ph.D.</a>, investigator in the Laboratory of Translational Genetics (LTG) and organizer of Dr. Petersen&rsquo;s two-day visit.</p>
<p>Later, Dr. Petersen gave an informal brown-bag talk titled &ldquo;Translational challenges in cancer research: Bioethics lessons and cancer biobanks,&rdquo; hosted by fellows from LTG and the Laboratory of Genetic Susceptibility. In addition, she participated in two roundtable discussions with DCEG investigators: &ldquo;Pancreatic cancer etiology: genetic and exposure studies: What have we learned and what&rsquo;s next?&rdquo;, hosted by Dr. Amundadottir and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349636" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349636" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260652" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349636">Rachael Stolzenberg-Solomon, Ph.D.</a>; and &ldquo;Incidental findings, informed consent, and return of results from genetic sequencing,&rdquo; hosted by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=18&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349696" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349696" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260653" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349696">Lynn Goldin, Ph.D</a>.</p>

<p>In November 2015, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349608" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349608" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260607" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349608">Neal D. Freedman, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH. Dr. Freedman conducts multidisciplinary epidemiologic studies to investigate the role of lifestyle and metabolic factors in cancer etiology, in particular the mechanisms by which tobacco products cause cancer and the risk factors for liver cancer. He is also DCEG&rsquo;s principal investigator for the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=854707" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="854707" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7260608" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="854707">Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovary (PLCO) Cohort Study</a>.</p>
<p>In following the dynamics of the tobacco epidemic, Dr. Freedman has shown that alterations in use patterns and the emergence of new tobacco products have affected cancer risks and burden. He is currently pursuing studies to evaluate the cancer risks of products such as electronic delivery systems and water pipes. His work has shown that tobacco products are even worse than previously thought and affect numerous organ systems. To better understand the physiological effects and health risks of tobacco, he is conducting one of the first studies of the effects of tobacco on the oral microbiome, with co-investigators <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=50&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349612" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349612" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260609" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349612">Christian C. Abnet, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=23&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349667" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349667" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260610" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349667">Anil Chaturvedi, Ph.D.</a></p>
<p>Many hypotheses link lifestyle, including diet, to liver cancer. In order to investigate the association of dietary and environmental exposures, Dr. Freedman has leveraged the prospective cohorts available in DCEG, whose complementary features permit a broad evaluation of potential liver cancer risk factors. He has made several novel discoveries, including associations with coffee and meat intake and is currently pursuing studies that examine the interrelationships of diabetes and fatty liver disease.</p>

<p>Researchers have suspected that external sources of estrogen, such as menopausal hormone therapy (MHT), increase photosensitivity. The more photosensitive a person is, the lower the dose of ultraviolet radiation needed to redden the skin. Because ultraviolet radiation is strongly related to skin cancer, photosensitivity may also play an important role in the development of the disease. This connection between external sources of estrogen and skin cancer led researchers to study whether oral contraceptives and MHT also increase the risk of basal cell carcinoma.</p>
<p>A recent study within the United States Radiologic Technologists Cohort explores how the risk of basal cell carcinoma is affected not only by external sources of estrogen, but also by reproductive factors, such as age of first period and age at menopause, which affect the levels of estrogen in a woman's body.&nbsp;<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=257&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302501#Cahoon" sys_contentid="302501#cahoon" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302501" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7276172">Elizabeth Khaykin Cahoon, Ph.D., S.M., M.H.S.</a>, and colleagues found that later age of natural menopause and having ever used MHT were associated with a higher risk of developing basal cell carcinoma.</p>

<p><a id="Top"></a>For over 15 years, researchers in the Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB) have made great strides in understanding the clinical and laboratory features of dyskeratosis congenita (DC). They&rsquo;ve been at the forefront of gene discovery for this disorder, utilizing the latest methods and technologies to identify a number of new genes. Led by Branch Chief <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_revision=34&amp;sys_contentid=349621&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="6268701" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349621" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475">Sharon Savage, M.D.</a>, their work has reached beyond the clinic to directly improve the lives of patients and families with DC. Recently, investigators identified a rare&nbsp;<a href="#Founder">founder mutation</a> in a DC susceptibility gene that will be included in future genetic carrier screening panels for <a href="#Ashkenazi">Ashkenazi Jews</a>.</p>

<p>DC is a rare inherited bone marrow failure and cancer predisposition syndrome caused by abnormal telomere biology. Telomeres are specialized structures at the ends of chromosomes that are essential for maintaining chromosomal integrity. DC is often diagnosed in childhood, but individuals can develop features of DC at any age. Families who have one child with DC are at high risk for having future children with the disorder.</p>
<p>Through family-based genetic linkage studies and more recent exome sequencing studies, Dr. Savage and colleagues have discovered several genes in which mutations cause DC, including <em>TINF2</em>, <em>WRAP53</em>, <em>RTEL1</em>, <em>ACD</em>, and <em>PARN</em>. Germline mutations in these genes plus six others are present in approximately 70 percent of DC patients. The remaining patients await new genes to be discovered.</p>
<p>In 2013, Dr. Savage and colleagues identified a&nbsp;<a href="#Homozygous">homozygous recessive</a> founder mutation in <em>RTEL1</em> that causes Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome, a clinically severe variant of DC among Ashkenazi Jews (Ballew, 2013). The first major finding from DCEG&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="#Whole-exome">whole-exome sequencing</a> efforts, <a href="http://www.jta.org/2014/06/19/news-opinion/united-states/after-losing-ayelet-galena-family-finds-joy-with-new-baby-thanks-to-nih-breakthrough-1">the <em>RTEL1</em> discovery has led to a direct benefit for at least one DC family</a>. The story has been covered in the popular press.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s extremely rewarding to see the work of our exome sequencing studies lead to a family&rsquo;s happy ending,&rdquo; Dr. Savage said. &ldquo;Patients and families are an important component of this research; family advocacy can really make a difference.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moving from the study housed at the NIH Clinical Center to the arena of population genetics, investigators collaborated with the Center for Rare Jewish Genetic Disorders and the Mount Sinai genetic testing laboratory to evaluate the frequency of the <em>RTEL1</em> founder mutation among Ashkenazi Orthodox and the general Ashkenazi Jewish population. They found the mutation at a high-enough frequency (0.5 to 1% carrier frequency) to suggest its inclusion in future screening panels for this population (Fedick, 2014).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The carrier frequency of this mutation was certainly higher than expected,&rdquo; Dr. Savage said. &ldquo;Eventually, we want to look at this variant in a larger number of samples to get an even more refined estimate of the population prevalence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, questions about the specific action of <em>RTEL1</em> mutations remain, and the known spectrum of disease caused by its variants is growing. The gene is recognized to be involved in telomere biology, but it encodes a multi-faceted protein that also has DNA helicase functions (important in DNA replication). &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still learning about this gene,&rdquo; Dr. Savage said. &ldquo;For example, there are variants associated with brain tumors and certain dominant mutations that cause pulmonary fibrosis, which is part of the DC phenotype. This particular <em>RTEL1</em> variant found in Ashkenazi Jews&mdash;we don&rsquo;t know if it can act in an autosomal dominant way, or if it is only recessive. This needs to be explored in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As chair of the medical board of the advocacy group Dyskeratosis Congenita Outreach, Inc., Dr. Savage recognizes the importance of this research to both clinicians and families. Many patients with DC still do not yet have an identified causative mutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding these genes gives DC families an added identity and helps them to better understand their disease,&rdquo; Dr. Savage said. &ldquo;Even if finding the gene doesn&rsquo;t necessarily mean that we can fix it, knowing the cause of disease makes a difference in the lives of our patients and families.&rdquo;</p>

<h3><a id="All-Cause-Mortality"></a>All Cause Mortality</h3>
<h4>Coffee Consumption</h4>
<p>Data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial showed that coffee consumption at baseline, compared to no coffee consumption, was associated with lower hazard ratios for overall mortality (&lt;1 cup/day: hazard ratio (HR) = 0.99; 1 cup/day: HR = 0.94; 2-3 cups/day: HR = 0.82; 4-5 cups/day: HR = 0.79; &ge;6 cups/day: HR = 0.84). Similar findings were observed for decaffeinated coffee and coffee additives. Inverse associations were observed for deaths from heart disease, chronic respiratory diseases, diabetes, pneumonia and influenza, and intentional self-harm, but not cancer. Coffee may reduce mortality risk by favorably affecting inflammation, lung function, insulin sensitivity, and depression. (Loftfield E, Freedman ND, Graubard BI, et al.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26614599">Association of coffee consumption with overall and cause-specific mortality in a large U.S. prospective cohort study.</a> <i>Am J Epidemiol</i> 2015;182:1010-1022)<!--1--></p>
<h4>Physical Activity</h4>
<p>A study of 165,087 adults in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health (aged 50-71 years) who completed questionnaires at two time-points and were followed until death or December 31, 2011, showed that prolonged television viewing time was associated with greater mortality in older adults and demonstrated for the first time that individuals who reduced the amount of time they spent watching television between the first and second questionnaires had lower mortality than those whose viewing patterns were the same or higher.

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>Candidate gene and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified 15 independent genomic regions associated with bladder cancer risk. In a search for additional susceptibility variants, the investigators followed up on four promising single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that had not achieved genome-wide significance. Using data for 6,911 cases and 11,814 controls from existing GWAS datasets and targeted genotyping for studies that did not have GWAS data, two SNPs achieved genome-wide statistical significance: rs6104690 in a gene desert at 20p12.2 and rs4907479 within the <em>MCF2L</em> gene at 13q34. Imputation and fine-mapping analyses at the 13q34 region suggest a single signal marked by rs4907479 in the 13q34 region. In contrast, there were two signals in the 20p12.2 region &ndash; one marked by rs6104690 and the other marked by two moderately correlated SNPs, rs6108803 and the previously reported rs62185668. The second 20p12.2 signal is more strongly associated with the risk of muscle-invasive (T2-T4 stage) compared to non-muscle-invasive (Ta, T1 stage) bladder cancer.

<h3><a id="Breast-Cancer"></a>Breast</h3>
<h4>Genetic Predisposition to DCIS</h4>
<p>Ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i> (DCIS) is a non-invasive form of breast cancer and is considered to be a non-obligate precursor of invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC). Using data from 38 studies comprising 5,067 cases of DCIS, 24,584 cases of IDC and 37,467 controls, all genotyped using the iCOGS chip, most (67%) of the 76 known breast cancer predisposition loci showed an association with DCIS in the same direction as previously reported for invasive breast cancer, with similar results for estrogen receptor positive DCIS and IDC. This provides the strongest evidence to date of a shared genetic susceptibility for IDC and DCIS. (Petridis C, Brook MN, Shah V, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26884359">Genetic predisposition to ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast.</a> <i>Breast Cancer Res</i> 2016;18:22)</p>
<h4>Insulin-Like Growth Factor</h4>
<p>Terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) are the primary structures from which breast cancers and their precursors arise. Decreased age-related TDLU involution and elevated mammographic density are both correlated and independently associated with increased breast cancer risk, suggesting that these characteristics of breast parenchyma might be linked to a common factor. A cross-sectional study of women with benign breast disease demonstrated that circulating levels of serum insulin-like growth factor-1 and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 are associated with TDLU count among women with benign breast disease, and that the strongest associations are found among women who have high mammographic density. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge that supports the evaluation of TDLU involution and mammographic density as possible intermediate endpoints in breast carcinogenesis. (Horne HN, Sherman ME, Pfeiffer RM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26893016">Circulating insulin-like growth factor-I, insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 and terminal duct lobular unit involution of the breast: A cross-sectional study of women with benign breast disease</a>. <em>Breast Cancer Res</em> 2016;18:24)</p>
<h4>Luminal Breast Cancer Heterogeneity</h4>
<p>Luminal A breast cancer, defined as hormone receptor positive and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, is known to be heterogeneous. In this study, investigators observed that most established breast cancer risk factors were similar in basal-positive and basal-negative luminal A tumors. There were non-significant but suggestive of differences in tumor features and family history. (Sung H, Garcia-Closas M, Chang-Claude J, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26679376">Heterogeneity of luminal breast cancer characterised by immunohistochemical expression of basal markers.</a> <i>Br J Cancer</i> 2015;114:298-304)</p>
<h4>Terminal Duct Lobular Units</h4>
<p>Elevated mammographic density (MD) is an established breast cancer risk factor. Reduced involution of terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs), the histologic source of most breast cancers, has been associated with higher MD and breast cancer risk. This study of the relationships of TDLU involution with area and volumetric MD, measured throughout the breast and surrounding biopsy targets (peri-lesional) indicated that TDLU involution and MD are correlated markers of breast cancer risk, suggesting that associations of MD with breast cancer may partly reflect amounts of at-risk epithelium. If confirmed, these results could suggest a prevention paradigm based on enhancing TDLU involution and monitoring efficacy by assessing MD reduction. (Gierach GL, Patel DA, Pfeiffer RM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26645278">Relationship of terminal duct lobular unit involution of the breast with area and volume mammographic densities.</a> <i>Cancer Prev Res (Phila)</i> 2015;9:149-158)</p>

<h4>Estrogen Metabolites (Also appears under Ovary)</h4>
<p>Within the Breast and Bone Follow-up to the Fracture Intervention Trial, investigators conducted a case-cohort study to evaluate 15 pre-diagnostic serum estrogens and estrogen metabolites with risk of incident endometrial and ovarian cancer among postmenopausal women not on hormone therapy. Estradiol was significantly associated with increased endometrial cancer risk, with 2-Hydroxyestrone and 16&alpha;-hydroxyestrone showing no associated after estradiol adjustment. Ratios of 2- and 4-pathway catechol-to-methylated estrogens remained positively associated with endometrial cancer after BMI or estradiol adjustment. Estrogens and estrogen metabolites were not associated with ovarian cancer risk.

<h3><a id="Esophageal-Cancer"></a>Esophagus</h3>
<h4>Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease</h4>
<p>Using Cerner Health Facts(&reg;), a database on 35 million patients, investigators found that rates of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) increased approximately 50% and esophageal cancer (EC) rates more than doubled between 2001 and 2010. Barrett esophagus (BE) rates declined approximately 40%. These data indirectly support the idea that increased incidence of EC may be partially due to GERD and raise the provocative hypothesis that BE rates may be decreasing possibly as a forerunner of continued stabilization of esophageal adenocarcinoma rates and a possible subsequent decline. (Petrick JL, Nguyen T, Cook MB. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26762962">Temporal trends of esophageal disorders by age in the Cerner Health Facts database.</a> <i>Ann Epidemiol</i> 2015; Epub Dec 11)</p>
<h4>MicroRNA Profiles</h4>
<p>The tissue-specificity and robustness of miRNAs may aid risk prediction in individuals diagnosed with Barrett esophagus (BE). A case-control study of 150 esophageal adenocarcinoma cases and 148 matched BE cases provided evidence that miRNA profiles from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue can discriminate EA from BE. This large analysis has identified miRNAs that merit further investigation in relation to pathogenesis and diagnosis of EA. These candidate miRNAs may provide a means for improved risk stratification and more cost-effective surveillance.

<h4>Novel <i>FANCI</i> Mutations</h4>
<p>Fanconi anemia (FA) is an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome caused by mutations in DNA repair genes. The investigators characterized three patients with FA and the VACTERL association caused by autosomal recessive mutations in <em>FANCI</em>. Data from these patients and limited data from cases reported by others suggest that mutations in <em>FANCI</em> may be added to the FA genotypes in which the VACTERL association is unusually frequent. <span>(Savage SA, Ballew BJ, Giri N, et al. </span><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26590883">Novel <em>FANCI</em> mutations in Fanconi anemia with VACTERL association</a>. <em>Am J Med Genet A</em> 2016;170:386-391)</p>

<h4>Menopausal Hormone Therapy</h4>
<p>Primary liver cancer occurs less commonly among women than men in almost all countries, suggesting that hormone levels and/or exogenous hormone use could play a role. A study of 339 liver cancer cases and 1318 matched controls was conducted within the United Kingdom's Clinical Practice Research Datalink. Menopausal hormonal therapy (MHT), especially estrogen-only MHT use, was associated with a significantly lower risk of liver cancer in an overall analysis and in a substudy of cases and controls with diabetes.

<h3><a id="Lung-Cancer"></a>Lung</h3>
<p><strong>Alcohol Consumption</strong></p>
<p>Using data from the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study, investigators found that alcohol consumption was associated with a modest reduction in the risk of total lung carcinoma at lower levels of consumption (for 0.5-&lt;1 drink/day) and a modest increase in risk in the highest category (for &ge;7 drinks/day), with some differences by histologic type. Alcohol was associated with an inverse association at all alcohol levels for squamous cell carcinoma and a modest increase in risk of adenocarcinoma among heavier drinkers. (Troche JR, Mayne ST, Freedman ND, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26672017">The association between alcohol consumption and lung carcinoma by histological subtype</a>. <em>Am J Epidemiol</em> 2016;183:110-121)</p>
<h4>Gene Expression and Smoky Coal</h4>
<p>Non-smoking women living in rural China who burn smoky (bituminous) coal for heating and cooking had gene expression patterns in buccal epithelial cells similar to those present in the cheek cells of active cigarette smokers. These results shed new light on the molecular mechanisms by which smoky coal exposure increases the risk of lung cancer. (Wang TW, Vermeulen RC, Hu W, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26468118">Gene-expression profiling of buccal epithelium among non-smoking women exposed to household air pollution from smoky coal</a>. <em>Carcinogenesis</em> 2015;36:1494-1501)</p>
<p><strong>Polymorphisms in MicroRNAs</strong></p>
<p>MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are suggested to be very important in the development of lung cancer. This case-control showed that MiR-16-1 rs1022960 may be associated with risk of lung cancer in a Chinese nonsmoking female population, however the gene-environment interaction between three miRNA single nucleotide polymorphisms and cooking oil fumes were not significant. (Yin Z, Li H, Cui Z, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26855588">Polymorphisms in pre-miRNA genes and cooking oil fume exposure as well as their interaction on the risk of lung cancer in a Chinese nonsmoking female population</a>. <em>Onco Targets Ther</em> 2016 Jan 19 doi: 10.2147/OTT.S96870)</p>

<h4>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</h4>
<p>A case-control study demonstrated elevated risks for NHL overall and some B cell lymphoma subtypes in association with the concentration of polycylic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in residential carpet dust, but without a monotonic trend, and there was no association comparing the highest quartile or tertile to the lowest. In contrast, risk of T cell lymphoma was significantly increased among participants with the highest tertile of summed PAHs and benzo(k)fluoranthene compared with the lowest tertile. Predictors of PAH dust concentrations in homes included ambient air PAH concentrations and the proportion of developed land within 2 km of a residence. (DellaValle CT, Deziel NC, Jones RR, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26573845">Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons: Determinants of residential carpet dust levels and risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</a> <i>Cancer Causes Control</i> 2016;27:1-13)</p>
<p><strong>Ultraviolet Radiation</strong></p>
<p>Ground-based ambient ultraviolet radiation (UVR) estimates were linked to incidence rates of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) subtypes from 15 population-based cancer registries in the United States from 2001 to 2010. HL incidence was lower in the highest UVR quintile for nodular sclerosis, mixed cellularity/lymphocyte-depleted, lymphocyte-rich, and nodular lymphocyte predominant HL, but 'not otherwise specified' HL. These findings support an inverse association between UVR and HL.

<h3><a id="Methods"></a>Methods</h3>
<h4>Analysis of Tumor Mutations</h4>
<p>The central challenges in tumor sequencing studies are to identify driver genes and pathways, investigate their functional relationships, and nominate drug targets. Efficiency, particularly for infrequently mutated genes, is compromised when subjects carry different combinations of driver mutations. Mutual exclusivity analysis helps address these challenges. To identify mutually exclusive gene sets (MEGS), investigators developed a powerful and flexible analytic framework based on a likelihood ratio test and a model selection procedure. Extensive simulations demonstrated that the method outperformed existing methods for both statistical power and the capability of identifying the exact MEGS, particularly for highly imbalanced MEGS. The method can be used for de novo discovery, for pathway-guided searches, or for expanding established small MEGS, and was applied successfully to data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). (Hua X, Hyland PL, Huang J, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26899600">MEGSA: A powerful and flexible framework for analyzing mutual exclusivity of tumor mutations. </a> <em>Am J Hum Genet</em> 2016;98:442-455)</p>

<p><strong>Pediatric CT Scans</strong></p>
<p>To investigate whether underlying unreported conditions could have biased an earlier report of a dose-response relationship between radiation exposure from pediatric computed tomography (CT) scans and the risk of leukemia and brain tumors in a large U.K. cohort, investigators collected and reviewed additional clinical information from radiology information systems databases, underlying cause of death, and pathology reports. Although there was evidence of some bias in the original risk estimates, re-analysis of the cohort with additional clinical data still showed an increased cancer risk after low-dose radiation exposure from CT scans among young patients. (Berrington de Gonzalez A, Salotti JA, McHugh K, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26882064">Relationship between paediatric CT scans and subsequent risk of leukaemia and brain tumours: Assessment of the impact of underlying conditions</a>. <em>Br J Cancer</em> 2016;114:388-394)</p>
<h4>Tool to Estimate Exposure from CT Scans</h4>
<p>Investigators used the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) reference pediatric and adult phantoms combined with the Monte Carlo simulation of a reference computed tomography (CT) scanner to establish comprehensive organ dose coefficients and organ absorbed dose per unit volumetric CT Dose Index. They also developed methods to estimate organ doses with tube current modulation techniques and size specific dose estimates. A graphical interface was designed to obtain user input of patient- and scan-specific parameters, and to calculate and display organ doses. The NCI Dosimetry System for DT (NCICT) provides more realistic anatomy based on the ICRP reference phantoms, higher age resolution, the most up-to-date bone marrow dosimetry, and several convenient features, compared to previous tools.

<h4>Exogenous Estrogens</h4>
<p>Because external sources of estrogen increase photosensitivity, researchers evaluated whether oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) affect the risk of basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Data from a large, nationwide, prospective cohort of women geographically dispersed across the U.S. confirmed a previous finding of increased risk of BCC associated with MHT and demonstrated novel findings of increased BCC risk associated with MHT among women experiencing natural menopause and for late age at natural menopause. There was no increased risk associated with oral contraceptive use.

<p><strong>Anthropometric Factors</strong></p>
<p>Greater height and body mass index have been associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, particularly papillary carcinoma, the most common and least aggressive subtype. This large, pooled analysis of 22 prospective studies (833,176 men and 1,260,871 women) observed that greater height and excess adiposity throughout adulthood are associated with higher incidence of most major types of thyroid cancer, including the least common but most aggressive form, anaplastic carcinoma, and higher thyroid cancer mortality. (Kitahara CM, McCullough ML, Franceschi S, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26756356">Anthropometric factors and thyroid cancer risk by histological subtype: Pooled analysis of 22 prospective studies</a>. <em>Thyroid</em> 2016;26:306-318)</p>
<h4>Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs</h4>
<p>Cyclooxygenase (COX-2) has been associated with tumor growth and metastasis in several cancers, including thyroid cancer. For this reason, it has been hypothesized that COX-2 inhibitors might have antineoplastic effects. Data from three large prospective population-based studies (the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study; the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial; and the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study) showed that self-reported frequency of aspirin and nonaspirin NSAID use one year prior to baseline (no use, &le;2/week, &gt;2-6/week, and &ge;7/week) were not associated with a reduced risk of thyroid cancer. (Patel D, Kitahara CM, Park Y, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26426828">Thyroid cancer and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use: A pooled analysis of patients older than 40 years of age.</a> <i>Thyroid</i> 2015;25:1355-1362)</p>
<h4>Histopathological Features Related to I-131 Dose</h4>
<p>There are limited data on the histopathology of papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTCs) diagnosed in irradiated populations. In a large thyroid screening cohort in Ukraine comprising individuals exposed to <sup>131</sup>I from the Chernobyl accident during childhood or adolescence, investigators observed strong, significant trends in decreasing tumor size and invasive properties of PTCs with each subsequent screening after adjustment for increasing age at surgery. There was a borderline significant non-linear <sup>131</sup>I dose response for the combined characteristics of tumor invasiveness, defined as the presence of extrathyroidal extension, lymphatic/vascular invasion, or metastases. In a subset of tumors for which somatic mutation profiling was performed, irrespective of <sup>131</sup>I dose, there was a significantly increased risk with the presence of lymphatic/vascular invasion for cases with common chromosomal rearrangements relative to cases without chromosomal rearrangements or to cases with <em>BRAF/RAS</em> point mutations. (Bogdanova TI, Zurnadzhy LY, Nikiforov YE, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26625214">Histopathological features of papillary thyroid carcinomas detected during four screening examinations of a Ukrainian-American cohort.</a> <i>Br J Cancer</i> 2015;113:1556-1564)</p>

Gilbert, Ph.D.</a>, staff scientist in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB), retired after nearly 20 years at NCI. She is internationally recognized for her outstanding contributions to statistical methodology for radiation epidemiology studies. For more than 35 years, Dr. Gilbert evaluated late effects of protracted radiation exposure among nuclear workers, including U.S. cohorts, multi-country studies, and more recently plutonium refining workers in the Mayak nuclear facility in the Russian Federation. Dr. Gilbert also served for more than 15 years as lead statistician for studies of second cancers after radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Dr. Gilbert also played a pivotal role as lead statistician for studies of cancer risk among Chinese benzene workers who were employed in multiple industries in 12 cities, drawing upon her extensive experience with nuclear worker studies.</p>
<p>Also in 2016, Dr. Gilbert was chosen to receive the Gold Medal for Radiation Protection by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. This prestigious award is given once every four years to a scientist who has made a highly valuable contribution to international radiation protection work during the preceding 10-year period. Dr. Gilbert will receive the prize at a meeting in South Africa in May. The laudatory prize citation summarizes her prominent career:</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="width: 80%; margin: 1em auto;">
<p>&ldquo;Few investigators have so notably advanced the scientific understanding of the carcinogenic effects of radiation exposures at low doses and contributed to radiation protection as much as Dr. Ethel S. Gilbert during her career spanning some 50 years. Dr. Gilbert is an expert on exposure to inhaled alpha emitters (plutonium and radon), as well as on the statistical effects of uncertainty of doses, errors in radiation dose&nbsp;estimates, and their impact on the relationship of cancer risk to radiation dose. She is highly regarded for her work on leukemia risk in nuclear workers, thyroid cancer risk from I-131, and lung cancer related to plutonium exposure. Much of this work has been accomplished or expanded in the past ten years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recently, Dr. Gilbert&nbsp;increasingly turned her attention to cancer survivor research, evaluating late effects of radiotherapy among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, cervical, testicular, and other solid cancers, thus moving the second cancer field forward and increasing our understanding of the separate and joint effects of radio- and chemotherapy on second cancer risks. Her results have contributed importantly to modern radiotherapeutic approaches to minimize late effects.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is exciting to see Ethel receive special recognition for her scientific contributions over the years,&rdquo; said <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349642" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349642" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260560" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349642">Amy Berrington de Gonz<em>&aacute;</em>lez, D.Phil.</a>, Chief of REB. &ldquo;This is a fitting capstone to her stellar career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over her career, Dr. Gilbert has received a number of other prestigious awards, including the NIH Merit Award (2003) and the NCI Director&rsquo;s Award (2015), which recognized her seminal efforts to advance understanding of low-dose radiation carcinogenesis and to develop state-of-the-art analytical methods to estimate treatment-related second cancer risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethel has been a pivotal member of the second cancers research team,&rdquo; said DCEG senior investigator <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=30&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349616" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349616" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7260561" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349616">Lindsay Morton, Ph.D.</a> &ldquo;Her statistical expertise in complex studies of treatment-related risks is unparalleled, and she is a dedicated collaborator &ndash; always available to answer questions or talk through challenges, conscientious in her analyses and writing, and generous in her teaching of junior scientists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Gilbert is a fellow of the American Statistical Association, an honorary member of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements, a former member of the National Academy of Sciences BEIR VII Committee on Health Risks from Exposure to Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, and also a former member of the study group for the 15-country nuclear worker study.</p>
<p>Dr. Gilbert received a B.A. in mathematics from Oberlin College and an M.P.H. and Ph. D. in biostatistics from the University of Michigan. Prior to joining NCI, she worked as a senior staff scientist at Battelle Pacific Northwest National Laboratory, and spent a year at the Radiation Effects Research Foundation in Hiroshima, Japan. Dr. Gilbert joined NCI in 1996.</p>

<p>Scientists have long established female breast cancer as a heterogeneous disease composed of many different subtypes, each with specific features. Emerging evidence indicates that those unique subtypes not only respond differently to treatment, but also have distinct causes. Despite the complexity of this disease, researchers have been able to conduct robust studies of female breast cancer etiology, due in part to the number of available cases.</p>
<p>This tumor also occurs in men, but is relatively rare&mdash;men are diagnosed at less than one percent the rate of women. Until recently, much of our understanding of male breast cancer has been extrapolated from knowledge of female breast cancer. The few epidemiologic studies of male breast cancer have been limited in size and scope. Many have involved case-control designs, raising questions about the possibility of recall biases. Analyses of individual prospective studies have been difficult, given the small number of cases.</p>

<p>Recognizing the need for study on this rarer outcome, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=39&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349672" sys_contentid="349672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349672" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7277691">Louise A. Brinton, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, DCEG Scientific Advisor for International Activities, began work on this question in the mid-2000s. She utilized several large resources to describe a number of potential risk factors. Within the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, elevated risks were associated with a family history of breast cancer, obesity, physical inactivity, and a history of bone fractures (Brinton, 2008). In an additional study within the Veterans Administration, Dr. Brinton confirmed significant associations of male breast cancer with medical diagnoses of obesity, and extended findings to identify Klinefelter syndrome (a rare genetic condition), gynecomastia (excess breast tissue), and orchitis/epididymitis (testicle inflammation) as significant risk factors (Brinton, 2010).</p>
<p>From these individual studies, Dr. Brinton was able to identify patterns of risk. However, a larger study population was needed in order to expand upon these findings and identify new risk factors. To accomplish this, Dr. Brinton assembled an international collaborative effort with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=36&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349597" sys_contentid="349597" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349597" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7277692">Michael B. Cook, Ph.D.</a>, and extramural colleagues to pool data from 21 studies, creating the Male Breast Cancer Pooling Project (MBCPP). They utilized both case-control and cohort studies, resulting in nearly 2,500 cases of this rare malignancy and 52,000 controls.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By coordinating such a project, we were able to compile large numbers of cases for more robust analyses,&rdquo; Dr. Brinton said. &ldquo;Considerable effort was involved in harmonizing exposure data. In particular, we were interested in determining if hormonal risk factors applied to this cancer in men, as they do for women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In 2014, Drs. Brinton and Cook published their first analyses from the MBCPP and confirmed that risk factors include obesity, Klinefelter syndrome, and gynecomastia (Brinton, Cook, 2014). Investigators observed a small but statistically significantly elevated risk for breast cancer in men with a high body mass index (BMI). Men with the highest BMI had a 35 percent greater risk of breast cancer compared to men with the lowest BMI. The elevated risk observed with men who have a high BMI (who often have excess breast tissue and elevated estrogen levels) appeared similar to the pattern for breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. It was also determined that gynecomastia, independent from both Klinefelter syndrome and obesity, was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of male breast cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Similar to female breast cancer, these results seemed to support a role for hormonal factors in the etiology of male breast cancer,&rdquo; Dr. Brinton said. &ldquo;We therefore were interested in following up these findings to assess relationships with endogenous hormones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To further clarify the underlying mechanisms, Drs. Brinton and Cook measured estrogens and androgens in samples contributed by seven cohort studies within the MBCPP (Brinton, 2015). These analyses showed a significant association with increasing levels of estradiol. In contrast, androgens were not substantially related to risk, nor were ratios of estrogens to androgens. These associations were not confounded or modified by other male breast cancer risk factors, including age or body mass.</p>
<p>Additional studies within the MBCPP have examined other potential factors related to risk. Neither alcohol consumption nor cigarette smoking appeared to be related (Cook, 2015) in a significant way. Although leisure-time physical activity has been consistently associated with a lower risk of postmenopausal female breast cancer, investigators found no evidence that physical activity conferred protection against male breast cancer (Arem, 2015).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to Louise&rsquo;s vision and tenacity with this effort, we&rsquo;ve been able to generate really interesting, novel data,&rdquo; Dr. Cook said. Analyses from the MBCPP have expanded knowledge of this poorly understood disease and have confirmed a strong hormonal etiology.</p>
<p>As a next step, Drs. Brinton and Cook plan to use the MBCPP as part of a collaborative effort to understand the germline genetics of male breast cancer. &ldquo;We hope that our work in DCEG will continue to shed light on the etiology of this rare cancer,&rdquo; Dr. Brinton said.</p>

<p>DCEG scientists have developed an extensive collection of tools to aid other researchers with study design and planning, data collection and analysis, and risk assessment. These tools are available free for download from the DCEG website.</p>
<p>Among these tools is <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302567" sys_contentid="302567" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302567" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7275584">Power for Genetic Association Analyses (PGA)</a>, a user-friendly software package designed to aid decision making for the design of association studies of candidate genes, fine-mapping studies, and whole-genome scans. The tool was developed by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349657" sys_contentid="349657" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1965" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349657" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275585">Philip S. Rosenberg, Ph.D.</a>, senior investigator in the Biostatistics Branch, with colleagues Drs. Idan Menashe and Bingshu Chen. PGA has been downloaded 260 times over the past year, making it one of DCEG&rsquo;s most downloaded tools. "The tool is widely used, which is very gratifying," said Dr. Rosenberg.</p>
<p>The team developed PGA to perform the power calculations necessary to determine sample sizes in case-control genetic association studies. Power analysis is used to estimate the sample size needed to reasonably detect an effect&mdash;an important step in study design&mdash;as well as to interpret study results.</p>
<p>Before PGA, most computational tools that were commonly used in genetic association studies were designed for family-based studies. However, these tools had limited capability in performing the power calculations necessary to assess genetic associations of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in general population studies. "I believe our tool set is an early and very sophisticated example of what user-friendly software can achieve&mdash;one that is now being emulated by the web-based tools being developed collaboratively by DCEG investigators and our colleagues at the NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics &amp; Information Technology (CBIIT)," said Rosenberg.</p>
<p>For PGA, Drs. Rosenberg, Menashe, and Chen developed algorithms and graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that calculate the sample size and the minimum detectable risk in genetic case-control studies for dominant, co-dominant, and recessive models of SNPs and SNP haplotypes. The GUIs can display multiple sample-size scenarios simultaneously and produce graphs and tables for printing or exporting in standard file formats.</p>
<p>The source code was developed in MATLAB<sup>&reg;</sup> and compiled so users can easily download and install the GUIs as a stand-alone application in Windows.</p>

<p>A new study has found that drinking water from private wells, particularly dug wells established during the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, may have contributed to the elevated risk of bladder cancer that has been observed in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont for over 50 years. Other risk factors for bladder cancer, such as smoking and occupational exposures, did not explain the excess risk in this region. The study, by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire; the departments of health for Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; and the U.S. Geological Survey, appeared May 2, 2016, in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em>.</p>
<p>Bladder cancer mortality rates have been elevated in northern New England for over half a century. The incidence of bladder cancer in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont has been about 20 percent higher than that in the United States overall. Rates are elevated among both men and women. A unique feature of this region is the high proportion of the population using private wells for their drinking water, which are not maintained by municipalities and are not subject to federal regulations. These wells may contain arsenic, generally at low to moderate levels. Previous studies have shown that consumption of water containing high concentrations of arsenic increases the risk of bladder cancer.</p>

<p>The DCEG community had the distinct pleasure of welcoming Dr. Noel Weiss, professor of epidemiology at the University of Washington (UW), School of Public Health and Community Medicine, as a Visiting Scholar in March 2016. Dr. Weiss is well known for the depth and breadth of his original research in both etiologic and translational epidemiology. In addition, he is also credited with helping the UW epidemiology program to build on their strong reputation in infectious diseases to a broader expertise and leadership role in the study of chronic diseases as well.</p>
<p>In welcoming remarks <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/hoover-robert">Robert N. Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.</a>, described Dr. Weiss not only as an outstanding epidemiologist and friend, but also an excellent teacher and mentor. DCEG has benefited greatly from the large number of expertly trained and talented investigators from UW who have completed post-doctoral training here.</p>
<p>In his seminar to the Division, titled &ldquo;Presenting data on potential gene-environment interactions: Lessons from recent studies of the epidemiology of cancer,&rdquo; Dr. Weiss neatly chronicled the common mistakes in epidemiological methods that can result in the reporting of misleading or incorrect associations. Many of his practical &lsquo;lessons learned&rsquo; received knowing chortles from the amused and highly engaged audience.</p>
<p>Over the course of two roundtable discussions Dr. Weiss focused on questions regarding the sufficiency or appropriateness of data to determine screening efficacy for colorectal cancer and precision prevention.</p>
<p>Dr. Weiss graciously spent his lunch hour in the company of a dozen DCEG fellows, learning about their backgrounds and asking specific questions to each about their research focus. The group asked Dr. Weiss his perspective on jobs, the field of epidemiology in the consortium era and the role of young investigators, as well as his career as a teacher. Co-coordinator of the brown-bag session <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/cgb-fellows#Bodelon">Clara Bodelon, Ph.D.</a>, fellow in the Clinical Genetics Branch said, &ldquo;Dr. Weiss offered valuable insight for fellows, especially regarding epidemiologic research and career paths."</p>
<p>In reflecting on the visit, Dr. Hoover remarked, &ldquo;The purpose of the Visiting Scholar Program is to enrich the scientific discourse within the Division, establish closer ties with collaborators and their institutions, and provide opportunities for junior investigators and fellows to interact with giants in the field. It gives me particular pleasure to host not only an esteemed colleague, but also a jovial and generous friend like Noel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Since their creation, the maps have allowed researchers to identify unusual patterns in cancer mortality which stimulated further studies to identify potential carcinogens. For example, certain hot spots on the maps led to the discovery of asbestos exposure as the cause of lung cancer in World War II shipyard workers, and snuff use as the cause of oral cancer in women in the southeast. The first maps, published in 1975 as the Atlas of Cancer Mortality for U.S. Counties, included data from 1950 through 1969 for white males and females; a subsequent atlas provided data for non-whites.&nbsp;Since that time, updated atlases were published with more recent data and covering blacks. In 2002, the Web version of the Cancer Mortality maps was published and subsequently updated with data through 2004 in 5-year increments.</p>
<p>This latest effort, which began in 2014 with an award from the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=835255" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="835255" sys_relationshipid="7260644" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="835255">inaugural DCEG Informatics Tool Challenge</a>, combines CMM historical data with GeoViewer. Its first phase launched with the most recent five years of mortality data, and the addition of earlier mortality data (in 10-year increments) is ongoing. GeoViewer includes the following enhancements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Data on demographics, incidence, prevalence, screening and risk factors;</li>
<li>Newer graphical user-interface to produce highly customizable maps that can be refined by the user;</li>
<li>Improved back-end functionality to make future uploading of new data easier;</li>
<li>Addition of Health Service Areas (HSAs), which are single counties or clusters of contiguous counties that are relatively self-contained with respect to hospital care. Increasingly researchers are looking at maps with HSA boundaries because they can cross state lines and can provide more homogeneous populations than State Economic Areas (SEAs), which do not cross state lines.</li>

<p>Dr. Groopman presented &ldquo;When there is no eye in team, can you succeed?&rdquo; and provided examples of successful team science from his international collaborations studying liver cancer in rural China. He detailed how his active networking with transdisciplinary collaborators has led to many rewarding research experiences. He also cautioned that a fear of failure should not prevent young investigators from taking scientific risks that may have the potential to yield great rewards, and that a professional path planned too carefully may miss serendipitous, career-defining moments.</p>
<p>Two postdoctoral fellows presented their work. <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/geb-fellows#Gu">Fangyi Gu, M.Med., Sc.D.</a>, spoke on &ldquo;Genes in the circadian rhythm pathway and five cancer sites,&rdquo; and <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/ltg-fellows#Choi">Jiyeon Choi, Ph.D.</a>, discussed &ldquo;A common intronic variant of <em>PARP1</em> confers melanoma risk and mediates melanocyte growth and senescence escape via regulation of <em>MITF</em>.&rdquo; Their talks were selected through a competitive review of submitted abstracts. In addition, more than 25 fellows presented posters on their research.</p>

<p>The symposium concluded with an interactive round-robin style networking session. More than 20 DCEG alumni led discussions on one of eight career categories: NIH-intramural, NIH-extramural, non-NIH federal agencies, academia, industry, non-profit organizations, and policy. The roundtable allowed DCEG fellows to learn about multiple career paths in small groups. The day ended with brief comments from the alumni who offered personalized career advice to current fellows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fellows continued to talk about the event for weeks afterward,&rdquo; said Dr. Lavigne. &ldquo;Several came to me to discuss job opportunities they learned about while networking with the alumni. We hope to make the alumni networking roundtable session a new tradition for this event.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A new study of the relationship between physical activity and cancer has shown that greater levels of leisure-time physical activity were associated with a lower risk of developing 13 different types of cancer. The risk of developing seven cancer types was 20 percent (or more) lower among the most active participants (90<sup>th</sup> percentile of activity) as compared with the least active participants (10<sup>th</sup> percentile of activity). These findings, from researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the American Cancer Society, confirm and extend the evidence for a benefit of physical activity on cancer risk and support its role as a key component of population-wide cancer prevention and control efforts. The study, by Steven C. Moore, Ph.D., NCI, and colleagues, appeared May 16, 2016, in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em>.</p>

<p>In April 2016, DCEG hosted a one-day workshop on HIV and cancer. The goals of the meeting were to identify scientific questions and hypotheses related to HIV and cancer, discuss approaches for addressing these knowledge gaps, and encourage collaboration.</p>
<p>People with HIV are known to have elevated risks of certain cancers, particularly those caused by other infectious agents. In the current treatment era, people with HIV are living to older ages, creating a need for additional research on cancer risk related to aging with HIV, effective cancer screening, and long-term risks and benefits of medications.</p>
<p>The workshop included four sessions that focused on major outstanding questions related to HIV and cancer: 1) lung cancer etiology and screening, 2) unexplained deficits in prostate and breast cancer, 3) HIV and aging, and 4) HIV medications, carcinogenicity, and chemoprevention. These discussions generated ideas for future studies and identified opportunities for collaboration across areas of expertise and disciplines.</p>
<p>The meeting was organized by <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/iib-fellows#Shiels">Meredith Shiels, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349601" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349601" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7260664" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349601">Eric A. Engels, M.D., M.P.H.</a> Workshop participants included investigators from DCEG as well as NCI&rsquo;s Office of HIV and AIDS Malignancy, Center for Cancer Research, and Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences.</p>

<h3>Outstanding Mentor Awards</h3>
<p>Mentoring is one of the most important values of the Division, and each year DCEG fellows nominate and vote for the Outstanding Mentor Award. This year, three mentors were selected in recognition of their exceptional commitment to the growth and productivity of junior scientists:</p>
<p><a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/engels-eric">Eric A. Engels, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, was praised in the fellows&rsquo; nomination for &ldquo;setting DCEG fellows on a path for success in their future epidemiology careers. His excitement for research is infectious, encouraging enthusiasm among his mentees, even when dealing with research obstacles. He is generous with his time, always eager to discuss research with his fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/kleinerman-ruth">Ruth A. Kleinerman, M.P.H.</a>, &ldquo;shows a profound interest in her mentees&rsquo; success by always taking extra time to discuss their new projects, progress, and goals. She is encouraging and never fails to show her appreciation for fellows&rsquo; contributions and efforts. Her commitment to being a lifelong learner makes her an incredible role model for all young scientists and fellows.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/mcglynn-katherine">Katherine A. McGlynn, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, &ldquo;is a committed, responsive, warm-hearted mentor who is vested in the success and well-being of her trainees. She helps fellows grow scientifically and spends time on their professional development. This ability of balancing mentoring while promoting self-sufficiency is a unique trait that makes Dr. McGlynn an outstanding mentor.&rdquo;</p>

One of their key findings is <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9145715">the association between total number of dysplastic nevi (DN), a specific kind of atypical mole, and risk of melanoma</a>.</p>
<p>To help patients and the general public distinguish common moles, DN, and melanomas that started from DN, the study team collected photographs of 29 different pigmented skin lesions in the new website <a href="http://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/nevustool/">Moles to Melanoma: Recognizing the ABCDE Features</a>. Geoffrey Tobias and Mary Fraser, R.N., M.A., curated the collection of case series, annotating each image with clinical descriptors and building a conceptual framework for the visual archive of the newly launched online tool. Each case series shows changes over time and across the various mole features typically seen among individuals from U.S. melanoma-prone families, chronicling the evolution of a DN to melanoma, or trending toward melanoma, or regression to a typical mole.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like so many important outcomes of epidemiologic research, we truly could not have done this work without the commitment and cooperation of the individuals in our family study,&rdquo; said Dr. Tucker. &ldquo;The Moles to Melanoma website allows us to bring this vital information into the 21st century by making it available to clinicians, patients, and the public.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Joanne S. Colt, M.P.H., M.S., Assistant Chief of the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), retired from the NCI in&nbsp;June 2016. Over the past two decades Ms. Colt has investigated occupational and environmental causes of cancer. She made many contributions as co-investigator on a study examining the role of pesticide exposure in the risk of childhood leukemia. She served as co-principal investigator on an investigation into the effect of&nbsp;hypertension, antihypertensive medications,&nbsp;and other factors on risk for renal cell cancer among whites and African Americans&nbsp;in the U.S. As part of the NCI collaborative New England Bladder Cancer Study, Ms. Colt examined the influence of occupational exposure to metalworking fluids on bladder cancer risk among men. Ms. Colt also advanced environmental epidemiology methods with her work on the development of a <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/tools/design/pesticide">pesticide exposure matrix</a> designed to help researchers identify the active ingredients to which residents are likely exposed when their homes and gardens are treated for pests.</p>
<p>In recognition of her service, Ms. Colt received several awards over the years, including an NIH Award of Merit, NIH Quality of Work Life Award, and the NCI DCEG Award for Outstanding Research Paper by a Staff Scientist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joanne has provided tremendous support to the branch over her career.

<h4>Leisure-Time Physical Activity</h4>
<p>Pooling data from 12 prospective US and European cohorts, the investigators found that leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks of 13 cancer types (esophageal adenocarcinoma, liver, lung, kidney, gastric cardia, endometrial, myeloid leukemia, myeloma, colon, head and neck, rectal, bladder, and breast). Most of these associations were evident regardless of body size or smoking history.

<h4>Arsenic</h4>
<p>Bladder cancer mortality rates have been elevated in northern New England for at least five decades. Incidence rates in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont are about 20% higher than the U.S. overall. A population-based case-control study in these states reported heavy consumption of drinking water from private dug wells (which are shallow&mdash;less than 50 feet deep&mdash;and susceptible to contamination from manmade sources than drilled wells), established prior to 1960 (when arsenic-based pesticides were widely used), may have contributed to the longstanding excess. Cumulative arsenic exposure from all water sources showed an increasing risk with increasing exposure: risk among the highest exposed participants was twice that of the lowest exposure group.&nbsp;(Baris D, Waddell R, Beane Freeman LE, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140955">Elevated bladder cancer in northern New England: The role of drinking water and arsenic</a>. <em>J Natl Cancer Inst</em> 2016; 108: Epub May 2)</p>

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility for ER-negative Disease</h4>
<p>A meta-analysis of 11 genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified four previously unidentified loci including two at 13q22 near <em>KLF5</em>, a 2p23.2 locus near WDR43, and a 2q33 locus near PPIL3 that display genome-wide significant associations with ER-negative breast cancerand <em>BRCA1</em>-associated breast cancer risk. Functional and eQTL studies implicated <em>TRMT61B</em> and <em>WDR43</em> at 2p23.2 and PPIL3 at 2q33 in ER-negative breast cancer etiology. All loci combined account for &sim;11% of familial relative risk for ER-negative disease and may contribute to improved ER-negative and <em>BRCA1</em> breast cancer risk prediction.

<h4>Role of the Environment</h4>
<p>Investigators refuted the hypothesis laid out by Tomasetti and Vogelstein (<em>Science</em> 2015 347 78-81); the investigators found no correlation between stem-cell proliferation indices and radiation- or smoking-related cancer risk.

<h4>Fecal Microbiota and Metabolome</h4>
<p>Investigation of microbe-metabolite relationships in the gut is needed to understand and potentially reduce colorectal cancer (CRC) risk. Microbiota and metabolomics profiling performed on lyophilized feces from 42 CRC cases and 89 matched controls demonstrated very strong microbe-metabolite correlations that were predominated by <em>Enterobacteriaceae</em> and <em>Actinobacteria</em>. Metabolites mediated a direct CRC association with <em>Fusobacterium</em> and <em>Porphyromonas</em>, but not an inverse association with <em>Clostridia</em> and <em>Lachnospiraceae</em>. This study identifies complex microbe-metabolite networks that may provide insights on neoplasia and targets for intervention.

<h4>Cooking Practices and Water Source</h4>
<p>A study of 300 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) cases and 571 controls conducted in the high-risk area of Golestan, Iran showed that red meat consumption above the 75th percentile increased the odds of ESCC by 2.82-fold, while fish intake was associated with a significant 68% decrease in ESCC odds. Among meat eaters, frying meat (red or white) and fish increased the odds around three-fold each. Drinking unpiped water increased ESCC odds by 4.25 times.&nbsp;(Golozar A, Etemadi A, Kamangar F, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25851181">Food preparation methods, drinking water source, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma in the high-risk area of Golestan, Northeast Iran</a>. <em>Eur J Cancer Prev</em> 2016;25:123-129)</p>

<p>Today, in <em>JAMA Oncology</em>, with my colleagues in the&nbsp;Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and elsewhere, we&nbsp;<a href="http://oncology.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=2524829">published a study</a> on a risk prediction model developed to assess the absolute risk of breast cancer in women of European background in the United States.</p>
<p>The model takes into effect risk factors that can be modified, like alcohol use, and those that can&rsquo;t, like family history and the constellation of previously identified common genetic risk variants, or SNPs. This multifaceted model can more precisely identify the subsets of women at highest risk of breast cancer who would be most likely to benefit from alterations to those modifiable factors.</p>
<p>The extent to which this model can be used to influence the behavior of individual women at increased breast cancer risk requires further study, of course. But it raises an important issue that cancer researchers are increasingly beginning to explore. Instead of studies that focus on what proportion of cancers are due to genetic differences, we now understand that it might be more insightful to inquire how the risk of each type of cancer is influenced by genetic predisposition to both the cancer and the effects of environmental exposures.</p>

In June 2016, James J. Goedert, M.D., senior investigator in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB), and a leading expert in the epidemiology of infection-associated malignancies, retired after 36 years with NCI. Over the span of his career, Dr. Goedert has focused on critical, emergent public health concerns with high visibility and immediate impact.
<p></p>
<p>In the first decade of the AIDS epidemic, Dr. Goedert identified major modes of HIV transmission and described the natural history of infection across different groups in the U.S. In his study of HIV/AIDS in patients with hemophilia, he demonstrated that a much larger than expected proportion of HIV-infected persons would go on to develop AIDS, a finding with broad implications for public health prevention and clinical practice. His study of twins born to HIV-infected women showed that the virus was most often transmitted during labor and delivery, rather than earlier in gestation, and with vaginal rather than cesarean delivery. He discovered that breast cancer risk was significantly reduced for women with HIV/AIDS, especially those with HIV that used a particularly chemokine receptor, CXCR4, on both blood and breast cells. His studies of Kaposi sarcoma revealed the surprising finding that this malignancy was much more common in non-smokers than in smokers.</p>
<p>In more recent years, Dr. Goedert has expanded his research to include studies of the human microbiome as it relates to cancer. Along with collaborators, he has been working toward the goal of establishing a bank of prospectively collected fecal specimens, suitable for microbiome and other assays. This work has the potential for novel, high-impact discoveries on the role of the microbiome in carcinogenesis and opportunities for prevention.</p>
<p>In recognition of his outstanding research, Dr. Goedert has received numerous awards, including the International AIDS Society's International LIFE Prize for his study of twins born to HIV-1-infected mothers and the Outstanding Service Medal from the U.S. Public Health Service.</p>
<p>Dr. Goedert was appointed Chief of the AIDS and Cancer Section of the Viral Epidemiology Branch (now IIB) in 1992, and served as Chief of the Branch from 1995 to 2008. In May 2016, he summarized his career and addressed important questions for future generations of scientists with a seminar titled &ldquo;3.6 decades of epidemiologic research on extraordinary cancer events: Unresolved clues for the next generations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Long-time colleague and friend <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/gail-mitchell">Mitchell Gail, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, introduced Dr. Goedert at the seminar with this tribute: &ldquo;Jim is an exceptional leader. Many ideas that he has worked on, like evaluating the reliability of microbiome assays, have evolved into major areas of research for the Division.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Goedert concluded his remarks: &ldquo;Working in DCEG to reduce and perhaps prevent the suffering of people with HIV/AIDS and cancer has been an honor and a privilege. My hope and expectation are that others will pick up where I am leaving off.&rdquo;</p>

<p>NCI researchers have developed a risk model-based approach for selecting smokers and former smokers who may be candidates for lung cancer screening with low-dose computed tomography (CT). Using data from two lung cancer screening studies and a U.S. health survey, the researchers estimated that the new approach might prevent more deaths from lung cancer over 5 years than would current screening recommendations. Results from the statistical analysis <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179989">appeared in <em>JAMA</em></a> on May 15.&nbsp;</p>

<p>An ongoing challenge in large-scale epidemiological studies is the processing and use of occupational exposure data, which is the first step in identifying and characterizing occupational exposures that may contribute to cancer risk. Typically study participants describe details about their jobs in free-text responses to open-ended questions about their title, employer, and work tasks. Standardizing these job descriptions is a crucial step, but manual coding is time-consuming and expensive.</p>
<p><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349680" sys_contentid="349680" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349680" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275453">Melissa Friesen, Ph.D.</a>, a tenure-track investigator in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB), and Daniel Russ, Ph.D., in the NIH Center for Information Technology, sought to address this problem by developing <a href="http://soccer.nci.nih.gov/soccer/">SOCcer (Standardized Occupation Coding for Computer-assisted Epidemiologic Research)</a>, an algorithm to efficiently identify, classify, and code occupations. Their application, which is publicly available, makes it easier for epidemiological researchers to incorporate occupational exposures into their studies.</p>
<p>SOCcer assigns standardized occupational codes, or SOCs, to free-text job descriptions using machine learning techniques based on natural language processing. The application is unique in its ability to estimate occupational exposure measurements from several components of a job, not just its title, thus providing insight into the full experience of the employee.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal was to estimate workplace exposures over an employee&rsquo;s entire working life&mdash;sometimes as long as 50 years,&rdquo; Dr. Friesen said. Lifetime occupational questionnaires were a key tool, in addition to detailed follow-up questions to certain subsets of participants.</p>
<p>In order to assign the most accurate code, SOCcer incorporates the study participants&rsquo; responses to open-ended questions about their job title, description, and other aspects of their employment history. Some job descriptions have multiple plausible codes; therefore, each SOC code is weighted and assigned a rank. By analyzing additional details of an employee&rsquo;s job description, SOCcer can distinguish between similar jobs or jobs with similar or identical titles, identifying which highest ranking SOC code is assigned to the job.</p>
<p>Evaluation of the algorithm in two case studies found that it reliably replicated manually assigned occupation codes; SOCcer&rsquo;s assignments had overall agreement with expert coders that ranged from 45% at the most detailed level of the classification system and 76 % at a major grouping level. Its agreement with manual coding increased with algorithm score; low scoring job descriptions are more likely to require expert review than high scoring job description.</p>

<p>The application is unique in its ability to estimate occupational exposure measurements from several components of a job, thus providing insight into the full experience of the employee.</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;The application is not intended to replace expert coders, but rather to prioritize which job descriptions would benefit most from expert review,&rdquo; Dr. Friesen said.</p>
<p>Dr. Friesen credits the success of SOCcer to wide-ranging support from collaborators and Division leadership. &ldquo;Dr. Russ, a computer scientist, was especially critical to this project,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;In addition, Dr. Chanock&rsquo;s support of technological tools that can advance NCI research allowed for SOCcer to be made available as an online application.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The team was awarded funds from the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=992798" sys_contentid="992798" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="992798" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7275454">2015 DCEG Informatics Tool Challenge</a> for its companion software <a href="http://soccer.nci.nih.gov/soccer/">SOCAssign</a>, which loads the SOCcer output into a visual display to aid expert coders in manual code assignment and reconciliation of poor computer-based matches. SOCAssign is freely available for download to users of the SOCcer website.</p>
<p>Dr. Friesen and collaborators continue to make improvements to the original SOCcer algorithm; SOCcer 2.0 will better capture the specific tasks associated with each job code. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not your job title, but what you actually do at your job that matters,&rdquo; Dr. Russ said. Better use of the additional text on work tasks may assist in building an even more accurate algorithm. Dr. Friesen and collaborators recently were awarded funds from the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1052886" sys_contentid="1052886" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1052886" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7275456">2016 DCEG Informatics Tool Challenge</a> for SOCcer 2.0.</p>

<p>Along the Andes mountain range, through Central America, and in many other regions of the world, gastric cancer is a leading cause of death. For one DCEG researcher, the study of this malignancy is a passion, and the primary cause for most gastric tumors&mdash;chronic <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection&mdash;is the subject of her ambitious research agenda. <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1052539" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1052539" sys_relationshipid="6431463">Maria Constanza Camargo, Ph.D.</a>, newly-appointed Earl Stadtman Investigator in the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=1033171" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033171" sys_relationshipid="6431468">Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB)</a>, knew from the start she wanted to work on gastric cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I breathe gastric cancer,&rdquo; she said, describing her passion for this work. Of the critical importance of this public health challenge, she was clear: &ldquo;We have to do something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was a circuitous path&mdash;both personally and scientifically&mdash;that brought her to the Division, starting from her home in Colombia, to graduate studies in Cuernavaca (Mexico), New Orleans and Chicago. In 2005, her research was interrupted when she and everyone else in the lab was displaced by Hurricane Katrina. But she was steadfast in her goal to tackle the pressing questions for this malignancy: If <em>H. pylori</em> is the causal factor, why do about 1% of those with chronic infection go on to develop disease? What cofactors drive carcinogenesis? How can we identify those at highest risk, who can most benefit from intervention or surveillance?</p>
<p>Dr. Camargo first came to DCEG in 2008 as a summer student. She returned the following summer and accepted a postdoctoral fellowship in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) upon completion of her degree in 2010. Since that time she has set her sights on the complex problems of gastric cancer etiology and prevention. To do so, she has developed a robust research program and a dynamic and multidisciplinary team to apply cutting edge molecular epidemiological approaches to the study of <em>H. pylori</em>, precursor lesions, and the natural history of gastric cancer.</p>
<h3><strong><em>H. Pylori</em></strong><strong> and Gastric Cancer</strong></h3>
<p>In general, survival of patients with gastric cancer is poor, mainly because of advanced-stage at diagnosis. There are ample opportunities for early intervention since gastric cancer develops over decades and advanced precancerous lesions can be cured by endoscopic resection (or less invasive surgical treatment). But without appropriate screening strategies it is impossible to know who is most at risk. The potential benefit of <em>H. pylori</em> eradication to prevent gastric cancer is highly suggested by some randomized trials in high-risk areas. However, there is insufficient evidence to justify large-scale implementation.</p>
<p>To collect the samples necessary to carry out her work, Dr. Camargo is working collaboratively with <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/rabkin-charles"></a><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349628" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349628" sys_relationshipid="6431464"></a><a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/rabkin-charles">Charles Rabkin, M.D.</a>, and other researchers around the globe, to build the first biobank of <em>H. pylori</em> clinical isolates and a case-control study to elucidate the risk factors for advanced pre-neoplastic lesions in a high-risk population, and potential non-invasive biomarkers for risk stratification.</p>
<h3><strong>Other Studies on the GI Tract</strong></h3>
<p>As a smaller research effort, Dr. Camargo is collaborating with <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/dawsey-sanford"></a><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349670" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349670" sys_relationshipid="6431465"></a><a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/dawsey-sanford">Sanford Dawsey, M.D.</a>, and MEB Branch Chief <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/abnet-christian"></a><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=45&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349612" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349612" sys_relationshipid="6431466"></a><a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/abnet-christian">Christian Abnet, Ph.D.</a>, to design and conduct molecular epidemiologic studies of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), another malignancy for which etiologic factors are few, and which may also be influenced by infections. Smoking and alcohol consumption are the major risk factors for ESCC in Western populations, but they are not strongly associated with disease in endemic Asian populations.</p>
<p>With tissue, blood and urine samples from previous ESCC studies waiting in the DCEG freezers, Dr. Camargo is poised to examine the relationship of this malignancy and its precursors with viral and bacterial infections and various molecular and immuno-related biomarkers. This broad approach is intended to identify a panel of biomarkers that may one day evolve to a highly predictive screening tool.</p>

<p>DCEG researchers study a wide range of potential causes of cancer, from inherited susceptibility to radiation-induced carcinogenesis. Among the specialty approaches they use to uncover novel causes of cancer are descriptive epidemiological studies. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1052540" sys_contentid="1052540" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1052540" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276416">Meredith Shiels, Ph.D.</a>, a newly appointed tenure-track investigator in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=55&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302590" sys_contentid="302590" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302590" sys_variantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7276417">Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch </a>(IIB), is one of a handful of researchers tracking and interrogating the patterns&nbsp;that emerge from cancer registry and mortality data.</p>
<h3>What can we learn from trends?</h3>
<p>As a co-principal investigator of the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303678" sys_contentid="303678" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303678" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7276409">HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study</a>, Dr. Shiels is continuing her descriptive work on HIV and cancer while expanding her research focus to collaborate widely across DCEG to investigate other exposures and cancer sites. For example, by utilizing data from SEER-Medicare, which links cancer incidence and medical claims information, she is working to quantify the effect of viral hepatitis on increasing hepatocellular carcinoma rates. Similarly, she is carrying out a quantitative assessment of the impact of obesity on increasing rates of late stage, large thyroid cancers.</p>
<p>Dr. Shiels is also taking advantage of advancements in technology, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, which have highlighted the importance of tumor characteristics beyond primary site and histology. Emerging molecular, genetic, hormonal, and viral markers that influence cancer treatment and prognosis are mostly missing from standard reports to registries.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As descriptive studies provide clues into etiology, it is critical that we understand the demographics, geography, and trends of cancer based on refined tumor characteristics,&rdquo; said Dr. Shiels. In order to do so, she and other epidemiologists within DCEG and at cancer registries, are linking information from pathology reports with existing trends data.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s in that butt? Carcinogenic components in cigarettes and other tobacco products</h3>
<p>While pursuing her descriptive work, Dr. Shiels maintains her interest in tobacco research; she led several studies of cigarette smoking, lung cancer and immune dysfunction during her fellowship in IIB. The rapid emergence of new tobacco products paired with the recent expansion of regulatory authority for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has resulted in increased demand for evidence on health effects. With <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349608" sys_contentid="349608" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349608" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276414">Neal D.

<p>Early-life factors from conception to childhood have important consequences for cancer risk later in life. Scientists have found evidence that certain exposures, like birth size and growth/stature, could play a role in future cancer development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Early-life exposures from conception through childhood can affect cancer risk in adulthood and later life.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>However, epidemiological studies of these factors face significant methodological challenges, including the long latency period between exposure and disease diagnosis and keeping track of the large number of subjects that must be followed over many decades. As a result, very few prospective studies have been conducted. Participants in retrospective studies may not know or have trouble recalling the circumstances of their birth or events from childhood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In our cohort studies, it&rsquo;s difficult to obtain early-life exposure information because we often enroll people when they&rsquo;re in middle to older age, to study them at a time when their risk of cancer is high,&rdquo; said <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=939428" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="939428" sys_relationshipid="6362545">Cari Kitahara, Ph.D.</a>, tenure-track investigator in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch.</p>
<p>To tackle these hurdles, DCEG investigators are partnering with international colleagues to apply cutting-edge analytical approaches to existing data resources, like population-based registries. Studies linking birth, school, and hospital registries with cancer registries allow investigators to explore early-life characteristics and cancer; by pooling data from multiple sources, investigators can explore even rare exposures and outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Population-based registries are one of the few ways in which we can look at a person&rsquo;s exposures that occur at or before the time of birth, and then relatively easily learn the diseases they developed later in life,&rdquo; Dr. Kitahara said. &ldquo;These registries are a very unique resource.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In particular, the Nordic countries&mdash;Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden&mdash;have a long tradition of collecting high-quality data through national population-based registries. Denmark has the oldest cancer registry, established in the 1940s. Birth registries were established later. Reporting is mandatory, thus the quality and completeness of the data are very good.</p>
<h3>Collaborative Studies with Nordic Data</h3>
<p>Since the mid-2000s, Rebecca Troisi, Sc.D., staff scientist in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, has collaborated with investigators from Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden, to organize pooled linkage studies to explore maternal and early life factors and subsequent cancer risk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The birth registries in these countries have information on a woman&rsquo;s pregnancy and maternal characteristics, as well as the baby&rsquo;s characteristics; we link this historical information to the cancer incidence data,&rdquo; Dr. Troisi said. &ldquo;We can continually do linkages and obtain information across an entire lifespan. These rich datasets allow us to study not only pediatric cancers, but those that arise later in life.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Troisi and collaborators have published a number of important findings. They reported an association between high birth weight and increased risks for several childhood tumors (Bjorge, 2013) and breast cancer in adulthood (Troisi, 2013); both low (&lt;2,500 g) and high (&ge; 4,000 g) birth weight increased risk for childhood testicular germ-cell cancer (Stephansson, 2011). Pregnancy factors did not appear to play a role in the etiology of bone cancers (Troisi, 2013), and hyperemesis gravidarum (severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy) did not increase cancer risk in offspring (Vandraas, 2015). Dr. Troisi is currently analyzing how early-life factors relate to the mother&rsquo;s subsequent cancer risk, after pregnancy.</p>
<p>Other DCEG investigators are utilizing this collaboration to study a variety of exposures and subsequent cancer outcomes. For example, Dr. Kitahara is looking at pregnancy characteristics, complications, and birth outcomes in relation to subsequent thyroid cancer in the mother and offspring.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was interested in pregnancy-related factors and thyroid cancer for a while, but was having difficulty finding the right data resource; I needed a very large population,&rdquo; Dr. Kitahara said. &ldquo;When I discovered that Rebecca was working with this group to combine registries, it seemed like the perfect opportunity.&rdquo; This latest study is in the early stages; collaborators in Denmark are performing a new linkage that will allow investigators to analyze different outcomes, including thyroid cancer.</p>
<h3>Copenhagen School Health Records Register</h3>
<p>Another important resource for epidemiologic studies of early-life factors is the Copenhagen School Health Records Register (CSHRR). In collaboration with Dr. Jennifer Baker, Dr. Thorkild S&oslash;rensen, and others in Denmark, DCEG investigators have conducted a number of studies utilizing data from the register.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are many advantages to working with these data,&rdquo; <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=24&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349597" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349597" sys_relationshipid="6362547">Michael B. Cook, Ph.D.</a>, tenure-track investigator in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB) said. &ldquo;They have a large population with excellent quality data collected over several decades. Individual identification numbers allow us to link with data collected later in childhood and from the national cancer registry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CSHRR includes health examination information on nearly 375,000 children (generally between the ages of 7-13) who attended school in Copenhagen, Denmark, from 1936 to 2005. Among many factors, they measured height and weight annually. Originally, the data were collected for record-keeping purposes only, not necessarily for research.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The paper records were going to be destroyed, but Dr. S&oslash;rensen saved them and had them electronically recorded,&rdquo; Dr. Kitahara said. &ldquo;We are lucky that he recognized their tremendous research value.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Several published studies have examined early-life anthropometric factors and future cancer risk using the CSHRR. Dr. Cook and collaborators found associations between childhood height with prostate cancer risk (Cook, 2013) and prostate cancer mortality (Aarestrup, 2015). Childhood body mass index (BMI) was weakly associated with prostate cancer risk, but was attenuated when adjusted for height (Aarestrup, 2014). In addition, Dr. Cook found evidence that individuals with higher childhood BMI were at elevated risk of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma, even though these cancers occurred many decades later in life (Cook, 2015).</p>

<p>&ldquo;Population-based registries are one of the few ways in which we can look at a person&rsquo;s exposures that occur at or before the time of birth, and then relatively easily learn the diseases they developed later in life.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Also using the CSHRR, Dr. Kitahara and colleagues found that greater BMI and childhood height were positively associated with thyroid cancer risk (Kitahara, 2013). They also found associations between greater birth weight and, in boys, greater height with increased risk of glioma in adulthood (Kitahara, 2014).</p>
<p>Other studies are underway. <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349637" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349637" sys_relationshipid="6362548">Katherine A. McGlynn, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, senior investigator in MEB, is investigating childhood height and future risk for testicular germ cell tumor, and <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=8&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=802306" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="802306" sys_relationshipid="6362549">Britton Trabert, Ph.D., M.S.</a>, tenure-track investigator in MEB, will be examining birth weight and subsequent ovarian and endometrial cancer risk.</p>
<p>In addition, Drs. Cook and McGlynn are in the process of linking the CSHRR to compulsory military conscription records for men who were drafted between the ages of 18-21. This linkage will enable them to examine not only height and weight in early childhood, but also in early adulthood. The investigators will look at a number of outcomes, including esophageal carcinoma, testicular, and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In recent work using other studies, we&rsquo;ve been able to show that weight change over the adult life course is important for esophageal adenocarcinoma,&rdquo; Dr. Cook said. &ldquo;By linking the CSHRR data to military draft records, we hope to delineate between risk associated with childhood and adult BMIs, and to assess the effect on cancer risk of weight change between childhood and adulthood.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Swedish Registries</h3>
<p>A growing body of evidence suggests that testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) may be influenced by prenatal exposures related to typical genital development. While cryptorchidism is a known risk factor for TGCT, few studies have evaluated the association between other birth defects and risk of TGCT.</p>
<p>Using large, linked population-based registries in Sweden, Drs. Trabert and McGlynn evaluated this important question and demonstrated that hypospadias, inguinal hernia, and other genital malformations are associated with an increased risk of TGCT (Trabert, 2013).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previously, it&rsquo;s been hypothesized that hypospadias could be a part of testicular dysgenesis syndrome,&rdquo; Dr. McGlynn said. &ldquo;This analysis provides some of the most definite evidence to date that hypospadias, and perhaps inguinal hernia, should be considered a part of the syndrome.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Future Directions</h3>
<p>While most linked-registry studies have been conducted in the Nordic countries, many U.S. states have used their own data for such research. Dr. Troisi and collaborators at the University of Washington are investigating the possibility of developing a consortium of state birth and cancer registries to provide data on early-life exposures and future cancer in offspring.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: left; width: 50%; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;">
<p>&ldquo;Enormous gaps in knowledge exist, not only in the epidemiology, but in the research efforts to understand biological mechanisms. We hope to expand on that in the future.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Sharing of data among states would provide the very large numbers of cases necessary to investigate rare tumors, and could address loss to follow-up from out of state migration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We think that it would be really worthwhile to do something like this in the U.S.,&rdquo; Dr. Troisi said. &ldquo;Our work in the Nordic countries is invaluable, but the population and exposures in those countries are not broadly representative of those in the U.S. Plus, some of the Nordic countries aren&rsquo;t even as big as our largest states. To do a record-linkage study with even a few states would be a huge accomplishment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While investigators continue to conduct big registry-linkage studies looking at early-life epidemiologic factors and cancer risk, there are important next steps to be considered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enormous gaps in knowledge exist, not only in the epidemiology, but in the research efforts to understand biological mechanisms,&rdquo; Dr. Troisi said. &ldquo;We hope to expand on that in the future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many early-life factors are determined by a complex interplay of genetic, hormonal, nutritional, and environmental exposures, and the mechanisms that explain the observed associations with cancer have not been established. In addition, it&rsquo;s not always clear if early-life factors have an independent effect on cancer risk, or if associations are confounded by adult exposures. Additional studies are needed to clarify these questions.</p>
<p>Understanding how cancer develops over the life-course has the potential to transform cancer prevention strategies by targeting interventions to key time periods in early-life when they may be more effective, rather than later in life, as is the current practice. This type of research could also enhance understanding of whether exposure to modifiable factors in early-life affects cancer disparities among racial/ethnic groups.</p>

<p>Epidemiologic research is based increasingly on observational data from routine clinical care captured in electronic medical records, but this presents many challenges for analysis. This web tool and customized R software package will use a new class of models called &ldquo;prevalence-incidence mixture models&rdquo; to support analyses of cohort data assembled within health care systems. These models seek to address the potential need for absolute and relative risk estimation for screen-detected cancer and precursors.</p>

<p>The World Health Organization estimates that 1.3 billion adults worldwide are overweight, and that a further 600 million are obese. The prevalence of adult obesity is 20% in Europe and 31% in North America. The authors estimate that about 1 out of 5 premature deaths in North America could be prevented if those who are overweight or obese had ideal BMI, making excess weight the second leading cause of premature death, after smoking. Increasingly high patterns of BMI in other areas of the world could result in public health impact similar to that of North America if efforts are not made to prevent them.</p>
<p>The absolute increase in risk for obese men was higher than that observed for obese women. The risk of death before age 70 among men and women with a normal BMI was 19% and 11%, respectively. Corresponding risks for moderately obese men and women (BMI 30-35) were 29.5% and 14.6%.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When they limited their analysis to never-smokers and excluded deaths in the first five years of follow-up, the investigators observed even overweight (BMI 25-29.9), was associated with an increase in premature mortality, compared to normal. Narrowing the data in this way can reduce bias from subjects with artificially lowered BMI from smoking or wasting diseases, both of which elevate risk of premature death.</p>

</div>
<p>Alfred G. Knudson, Jr., M.D., Ph.D., was a visionary geneticist best known for his groundbreaking theory of cancer causation that explained the relationship between hereditary and non-hereditary forms of cancer, and paved the way for the eventual discovery of tumor-suppressor genes. Published in 1971, his &ldquo;two-hit&rdquo; mutational model was derived from an elegant mathematical analysis of the clinical and epidemiological patterns of the pediatric eye tumor, retinoblastoma; he reported that one germinal and one somatic mutation were responsible for hereditary cases, and two somatic mutations for non-hereditary (sporadic) cases. Dr. Knudson was then able to map the chromosomal location of the retinoblastoma gene, which provided the basis for its isolation by others as the first known tumor-suppressor gene (<em>RB-1</em>).</p>
<p>Dr. Knudson came to the NCI on leave from the Fox Chase Cancer Center in the late 1990s to help the leadership of NCI develop the research agenda in cancer genetics across the Institute and its newly formed Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). It was an exhilarating time in cancer genetics and biology, and Dr. Knudson agreed to serve for several years as acting director of the DCEG Human Genetics Program. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=26&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349665" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349665" sys_relationshipid="7269912" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349665">Dr. Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr.</a>, the founding director of DCEG, commented that &ldquo;Al&rsquo;s extraordinary scientific insights and mentoring were critical to accelerating progress during the early years of the Division."</p>
<p>Writing in a commentary in <em>The Linkage</em> newsletter in 1998, Dr. Knudson described his approach to research as open-ended: &ldquo;The largest advances in science often come when you least expect them. When you specify everything you&rsquo;re going to do in a plan, it tends to diminish opportunities for major breakthroughs.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349664" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349664" sys_relationshipid="7269913" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349664">Dr. Robert Hoover</a> reflected on his friend and colleague, &ldquo;what impressed me most was the depth and breadth of Al&rsquo;s intelligence&mdash;it wasn&rsquo;t limited to his scientific training. He was brilliant on any topic he took interest in.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to Dr. Fraumeni, &ldquo;Al&rsquo;s scientific stature and his interdisciplinary approach to cancer research helped build bridges between basic, clinical and population sciences that fueled collaborations across NCI and well beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Knudson has been recognized with the most prestigious scientific awards and honors that are given in biomedical research. Here at NCI, the Alfred G. Knudson, Jr. Award Lecture was established in 1998 to recognize visionary thinkers in the field of cancer genetics. For almost two decades, Dr. Knudson attended the lectures and poster sessions given at the annual NCI Intramural Scientific Retreat, even after he returned to Fox Chase. He was always accompanied by his wife, Dr. Anna Meadows, a leading pediatric oncologist who had also taken leave from the Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia to direct the first NCI research program in cancer survivorship.</p>
<p>As successor to Dr. Knudson in directing the human genetics program in DCEG, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349685" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349685" sys_relationshipid="7269914" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349685">Dr. Margaret Tucker</a> emphasized that Dr. Knudson&rsquo;s impact was felt beyond his seminal discoveries in cancer research. &ldquo;Al was an unfailingly kind and generous friend and mentor who inspired the careers and enriched the lives of all who came into contact with him. We will always remember him as a hero in medicine.&rdquo;</p>

In her last year of medical school, a patient with six different types of cancer came into her clinic. Curiosity led Dr. Achatz to the medical library and, some years later,&nbsp;to the identification of the high occurrence of a rare inherited syndrome caused by a founder mutation among families in Southern Brazil, Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS), an inherited disorder that dramatically increases affected individuals&rsquo; risk for developing cancer.</p>
<p>Though considered rare, Dr. Achatz found a much higher than expected prevalence of LFS in Southern Brazil: 1 in every 300 individuals carries a distinctive founder mutation in the tumor suppressor gene <em>TP53</em> known as p.R337H. As part of CGB, Dr. Achatz will continue her investigations to identify other corners of the world where LFS has yet to be identified, but could be causing disease. In addition, she plans to extend her work to search for possible inherited factors to explain cancer patterns among isolated communities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;DCEG offers a whole-world perspective,&rdquo; commented Dr. Achatz, &ldquo;For me, it&rsquo;s an amazing opportunity to work with the NCI LFS cohort, alongside Drs. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=43&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349621" sys_contentid="349621" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349621" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7259161">Sharon Savage</a> and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=26&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349665" sys_contentid="349665" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349665" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7259162">Joseph Fraumeni</a>.&rdquo; In her new position, she will collaborate with international and national groups on building oncogenetic resources and conduct testing, especially for those areas of the globe where resources are too scarce for this type of investigation.</p>
<p>In particular, Dr. Achatz will look closely at the patterns of tumor heterogeneity, somatic mutations, and germline variants in patients with LFS. She also plans to follow-up on health outcomes in the Brazilian cohort, which differ from the pattern observed among LFS families in the U.S. due to the p.R337H <em>TP53</em> founder mutation. This mutation, in exon 10 of <em>TP53</em> is outside the domain observed in most LFS families from other parts of the world. Brazilian LFS patients often also have an intronic duplication that delays onset of cancer by roughly 19 years.</p>
<p>Even more surprising, patients with p.R337H appeared remarkably healthy. They do not report hypertension, Alzheimer disease, or osteoporosis. What is more, they look decades younger than their chronological age.</p>
<p>Dr. Achatz will extend her study of this phenomenon by exploring the biological mechanism that might explain these observations, including the role of telomere length in the Brazilian cohort. Telomeres, caps that protect the ends of our DNA strands, naturally shorten with aging, but in some inherited syndromes like LFS, patients have shorter than typical telomeres.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Combining clinical observations with genetics and molecular markers is the centerpiece of the research in CGB,&rdquo; said Branch Chief Sharon Savage. &ldquo;We are excited to have Maria Isabel contribute her unique expertise to our group.&rdquo;</p>

Albert, Ph.D.</a>, joined the Division as Chief of the Biostatistics Branch. His research interests include complex modeling of correlated outcomes in biomedical sciences, including the analysis of longitudinal data, diagnostic testing, and data from biomarker studies.</p>
<p>In his own research program Dr. Albert focuses on the development of new methodological techniques for predicting future disease progression or poor outcomes from longitudinally collected biomarkers, including Markov modeling techniques for recurrent events with misclassification.</p>
<p>A veteran of NIH, Dr. Albert has held positions of scientific leadership in biostatistics in multiple Institutes. Most recently he was senior investigator and Chief of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics Branch in the Division of Epidemiology, Statistics, and Prevention in the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development.</p>
<p>During his tenure at NICHD he was involved in a variety of research efforts, from investigations on fetal growth and teenage sleep patterns, to molecular studies of gestational diabetes. Dr. Albert brings to the Biostatistics Branch his deep commitment to optimizing study design, statistical modeling, and analysis in an era of increased technology and data collection, in particular the treatment of data missing at random, or absent for a particular reason, which often has implications for study outcomes.</p>

Dr. Blair is a scientist emeritus in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, where he previously served as chief and senior investigator. His research on occupational exposures including pesticides, dry cleaning solvents, and formaldehyde, has resulted in over 450 scientific publications. Findings from his work have been instrumental in IARC&rsquo;s decision to classify several of these chemicals as carcinogenic to humans.</p>
<p>Dr. Blair will receive the award and deliver a keynote address at the 25th annual EPICOH meeting in September, 2016, in Barcelona, Spain. EPICOH is part of the International Commission of Occupational Health, which consists of occupational health scientists from 35 countries around the world.</p>

HiSTEP was designed to expand opportunities for financially disadvantaged high school students interested in STEM-M (science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medically-related) fields. A total of 26 students chosen for the program spent five weeks in a full-time internship at NIH learning about biomedical research.</p>

<p>OE staff and fellows presented two sessions. The first took place during the week-long session focused on research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. The DCEG portion focused on the role of public service announcements (PSAs) in drug or alcohol abuse prevention. Dr. Lavigne gave an overview of public health communications. Students were then divided into groups to develop video PSAs related to one of five topics: abuse of prescription drugs, synthetic marijuana, alcohol, heroin, and marijuana. Dr. Lavigne, Diane Wigfield, and several DCEG fellows served as facilitators. Each group considered the goal of the PSA, the appropriate message for the video, and its target audience. They developed a concept, final message, and produced a short video PSA.</p>

<p>In their second session OE volunteers discussed &ldquo;hot topics in public health.&rdquo; Dr. Lavigne presented the fundamental concepts and language of epidemiology. DCEG facilitators split the students into two groups, one focused on the Zika virus, and the other on the Flint, Michigan, water crisis. The Zika group discussed the approach of epidemiologists dealing with the crisis and role-played how different individuals might decide whether to travel to the summer Olympics in Rio, Brazil, where Zika is endemic. The students focused on Flint reviewed the history of the crisis, the role of health professionals and community members, and the steps needed to resolve the problem.</p>

<p>Starting in the middle of May through the middle of July, the summer interns kept coming, totaling close to 50&mdash;typically, DCEG hosts 15 to 30. The interns, whose academic levels ranged from high school through postgraduate and medical school, were selected out of a pool of over 400 applicants.</p>

<p>Summer interns learned by doing&mdash;conducting research in a selected area of epidemiologic or genetic investigation under the mentorship of investigators and fellows. They also took advantage of informal &ldquo;clubs&rdquo; put on by DCEG fellows, designed to help them learn skills to support a scientific career&mdash;scientific writing, research poster production, use of statistical software, and much more.

<p>Every year at the end of August a unique collection of kids ranging in age from 7 to 17 gathers for the annual Camp Fantastic at the 4-H Recreation Center in Front Royal, VA. Special Love, Inc., a non-profit organization dedicated to enriching the lives of children with cancer and their families, runs the program. One of the unique features of Camp Fantastic is the partnership with the National Cancer Institute (NCI); the Institute supports the program with a clinical protocol. All of the children are either in treatment for cancer or within three years of completing their treatment. Many of the counselors and staff were once campers themselves.</p>
<p>Over its 35-year history many current and former DCEG staff have volunteered at camp. In addition to DCEG Director <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349630" sys_relationshipid="7260473" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349630">Stephen J.

<p>Dr. Chanock, trained in pediatric oncology and infectious diseases, supervises the &ldquo;med&rdquo; team made up of clinicians and nurses from the NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch, part of the NCI Center for Cancer Research, and other hospitals. The team works closely with Special Love to coordinate care for the nearly 100 children at camp. Dr. Chanock reflected on this summer&rsquo;s experience, &ldquo;It is a magical week that resets my compass and reaffirms my commitment to cancer research. I feel blessed to be in the presence of so many remarkable and noble children. I am already looking forward to next year.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Merino, herself a pediatric cancer survivor, reflects, &ldquo;Camp is part of the healing process and I am honored to be a part of it. Here, adults don't treat kids like patients, but as normal kids. Here, kids make life-long connections and get support from friends with whom they can talk about scars, fears and the latest movie releases&ndash;all in the same sentence.&rdquo; Dr. Merino is trained in cancer genomics; for her doctoral work she refined the molecular landscape of choroid plexus tumors, a set of rare but lethal pediatric brain tumors tightly associated with Li-Fraumeni Syndrome. In DCEG she is focusing on the genomics of multiple primary tumors in childhood cancer survivors and individuals with inherited cancer predisposition syndromes.</p>
<p>Dr. Withrow knew right away she wanted to volunteer for camp. She joined the Division in May and was signed up by July. This was not her first camp experience; she has volunteered at similar programs at home in Canada. "Camp is an exceptionally happy place full of singing, splashing, laughter and dress-up,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Seeing firsthand the consequences of childhood cancer is challenging, but knowing that you are contributing to a rare positive experience in the cancer journey for these kids is well worth it." In DCEG, Dr. Withrow&rsquo;s research interests include socio-demographic and economic disparities in cancer survival and survivorship, the role of radiotherapy in second cancer risk, and the application of survival analysis techniques to these research areas.</p>
<p>Dr. Colli, trained in internal medicine and clinical oncology in his native Brazil, also volunteered on &ldquo;med&rdquo; staff. "It was a pleasure and a privilege,&rdquo; he said about his time at camp. &ldquo;Everyone makes everything possible, including the creation of a complex mini-hospital so the kids can just be kids.&rdquo; Dr. Colli joined Dr. Chanock&rsquo;s Laboratory of Genetic Susceptibility in 2013 to focus on post-GWAS and functional studies of kidney cancer. He has a special interest in translating genomics to clinical practice.</p>
<p>Over two summers in the LTG, Mr. Muchmore conducted functional investigations of genome-wide association study hits associated with bladder cancer under the mentorship of <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=34&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349662" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349662" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7260478" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349662">Ludmila Prokunina-Olsson, Ph.D.</a> He traveled across the ocean to return to camp, all the way from Thailand where he lives and works as a research fellow at Chulalongkorn University&rsquo;s Center of Excellence in Clinical Virology, Bangkok, Thailand. In reflecting on the week he said, &ldquo;Those who are lucky enough to partake in camp every year are paid back 100 fold. Whether it is seeing a child who is in and out of hospice walk (dance!) for the first time in a very long time or telling scary stories at night to kids who know realities much scarier, camp is an unbelievable dose of perspective. Frankly, the world would be a much, much better place if everyone got to experience camp magic."</p>
<p>Mr. Kemgang spent a summer after high school working with Dr. Chanock in the Laboratory of Genetic Susceptibility. Now he is in school working towards a joint undergraduate degree in biochemistry and French. Mr. Kemgang has spent several summers at camp: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always taken aback by how people from all walks of life humbly set aside their differences and come together to bring one objective to fruition: giving the campers the best week they&rsquo;ve had their entire year.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Similar to other overnight camps, Camp Fantastic offers a week away from home, with no calls or visits from parents, and no TV or smartphones. During a typical day, the kids go horseback riding, make wallets out of duct tape, or dress-up in &ldquo;glamour camp.&rdquo; In the evenings volunteer groups from the local community serve dinner and help set up evening activities and the nightly campfire. Monday we had a carnival, complete with motorcycles, a fire truck and the dunk tank&mdash;a camp favorite. Wednesday we all set off to Culpeper, Virginia, where volunteers help out with rides on farm equipment and water balloon fights, kids versus counselors. The involvement of the community adds to the spirit we call &ldquo;camp magic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For me, I think it&rsquo;s easy for researchers to feel disconnected from the real-life aspects of living with or surviving cancer. Camp provides a unique opportunity for staff to live and play with patients. It&rsquo;s not always easy to know the campers feel about the experience. One 17-year-old, saying goodbye for the last time told us, &ldquo;Because of Camp Fantastic, I finally feel normal again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DCEG fellows also organized two journal clubs at the NCI Shady Grove campus.&nbsp;The first, titled &ldquo;Bridging the gap between mass media and health research: A cancer epidemiologist&rsquo;s perspective,&rdquo; was led by postdoctoral fellows <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=88&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1033198" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7257414" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1033198" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1033198">Hannah Oh, Sc.D.</a>, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=88&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1033198" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7257415" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1033198" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1033198">Jessica Petrick, Ph.D.</a>, of the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB). The objective was to cover critical analysis of epidemiologic methods in cancer research. To achieve this, participants reviewed journal articles and compared them with the messages conveyed about them via mass media. Using examples drawn from nutritional and hormonal cancer epidemiology research, discussions focused on exposure assessment, measurement error, study heterogeneity, confounding, and interaction.</p>

<p>Investigators in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=29&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302432" sys_contentid="302432" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302432" sys_variantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7276076">Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG)</a>, part of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and their collaborators, have described a relationship between common, inherited genetic variants associated with cancer risk, found in the <em>APOBEC3</em> region of the genome, environmental exposures, and the pattern of somatic mutations that are caused by the APOBEC3 enzymes. These enzymes fight infections at the cellular level by mutating genetic material in viruses. However, they can sometimes misfire and end up mutating the host DNA as well, causing damage that could contribute to the development of cancer.</p>
<p>APOBEC3 enzymes generate DNA mutations of a specific type, known as the APOBEC signature mutation pattern, which has been observed in over half of the tumor types evaluated by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). However, until now the factors contributing to APOBEC mutagenesis were unknown. This study, published online in <em>Nature Genetics</em> on September 19, 2016, is the first to link APOBEC mutagenesis in tumors with functional germline variants associated with cancer risk, and environmental exposures.</p>
<p>In particular, the investigators showed that two common germline variants in the <em>APOBEC3</em> region on chromosome 22, previously associated with risk for bladder and breast cancer, were also associated with increased expression of mRNA transcripts that encode the APOBEC3B and APOBEC3A enzymes, in bladder and breast tumors, respectively. Furthermore, the same germline variants and mRNA transcripts were significantly associated with increased number of APOBEC signature mutations in tumors.</p>
<p>When the investigators exposed cancer cell lines to a viral infection or a DNA-damaging drug, they observed a strongly induced expression of APOBEC3A and APOBEC3B. Co-first author <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=279&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302640#Banday" sys_contentid="302640#banday" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302640" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7276074">Rouf Banday, Ph.D.</a>, from LTG, commented, &ldquo;our finding suggests that even transient environmental exposures that induce APOBEC3s could be a cause of DNA mutagenesis, and eventually, tumor initiation and progression. Individuals with germline variants affecting APOBEC3 expression may more easily acquire APOBEC signature mutations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The investigators also reported that in bladder tumors, increased APOBEC signature mutation load and homozygosity for the risk allele of the bladder cancer-associated SNP, were associated with improved survival for patients with aggressive, muscle-invasive bladder cancer. This genotype group includes more than half of all bladder cancer patients. &ldquo;We were surprised by this finding,&rdquo; said senior author <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=34&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349662" sys_contentid="349662" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349662" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276075">Ludmila Prokunina-Olsson, Ph.D.</a>, also from LTG. &ldquo;One explanation is that higher mutation load may improve the effectiveness of treatments that cause DNA damage, since the tumor cells will be less likely to recover. Tumor cells with more mutations are also more vulnerable to synthetic lethality due to mutation combinations, and they express more cell-surface neoantigens that can trigger the patient&rsquo;s immune response, leading to elimination of the tumor cells. Thus, APOBEC mutagenesis could help eliminate tumors cells through several mechanisms. On the other hand, APOBEC mutagenesis contributes to tumor evolution and resistance to treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since most bladder tumors and many other tumor types show evidence of APOBEC mutagenesis, these findings may contribute to our understanding of important, clinically significant biological mechanisms and open new avenues for research.</p>

<h3><a id="All-Causes"></a>All Cause Mortality</h3>
<h4>Body Mass Index (also under Obesity)</h4>
<p>Analysis of data pooled from 189 studies, representing over 10.5 million people from 32 countries, demonstrated body mass index (BMI) outside of the normal range (20-24.9) is associated with increased risk of mortality. The finding held across all areas of the world, with the absolute increases in risk for obese and moderately obese men higher than those among obese and moderately obese women, respectively. When the analysis was limited to never-smokers and excluded deaths in the first five years of follow-up, there was an increase in premature mortality among even overweight (BMI 25-29.9) persons, compared to those in the normal range. (Global BMI Mortality Collaboration. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27423262">Body-mass index and all-cause mortality: Individual-participant-data meta-analysis of 239 prospective studies in four continents.</a> <em>Lancet</em> 2016).

<h3><a id="Bladder"></a>Bladder</h3>
<h4>APOBEC-Signature Mutations</h4>
<p>Investigators explored the contribution of two common germline variants in the APOBEC3 region. SNP rs1014971 was associated with bladder cancer risk, increased APOBEC3B expression, and enrichment with APOBEC-signature mutations in bladder tumors. In contrast, a 30-kb deletion that eliminates APOBEC3B and creates an APOBEC3A-APOBEC3B chimera was not important in bladder cancer, whereas it was associated with breast cancer risk and enrichment with APOBEC-signature mutations in breast tumors. <em>In vitro</em>, APOBEC3B expression was predominantly induced by treatment with a DNA-damaging drug in bladder cancer cell lines, and APOBEC3A expression was induced as part of the antiviral interferon-stimulated response in breast cancer cell lines. These findings suggest a tissue-specific role of environmental oncogenic triggers, particularly in individuals with germline APOBEC3 risk variants. (Middlebrooks CD, Banday AR, Matsuda K, et al.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27643540">Association of germline variants in the APOBEC3 region with cancer risk and enrichment with APOBEC-signature mutations in tumors</a>.&nbsp; <em>Nat Genet</em> 2016).

<h3><a id="Breast-Cancer"></a>Breast</h3>
<h4>Birth Cohort Effects</h4>
<p>In a study that simultaneously compared birth cohort effects among both younger and older women in Asian and Western populations, investigators found that rapidly rising cohort-specific breast cancer rates have narrowed the historic disparity between Chinese and U.S. non-Hispanic white women, particularly in regions with the lowest baseline rates and among older women. (Sung H, Rosenberg PS, Chen WQ, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26992019">The impact of breast cancer-specific birth cohort effects among younger and older Chinese populations.</a> <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2016)</p>
<h4>Genetics</h4>
<p>Previous genome-wide association studies identified two independent breast cancer susceptibility loci represented by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs13281615 and rs11780156 at 8q24. A fine-mapping study identified three additional independent association signals in women of European ancestry, represented by rs35961416, rs7815245, and rs2033101. Integrative analysis using functional genomic data from several sources implied that SNPs rs7815245 in Signal 3, and rs1121948 in Signal 5 (in linkage disequilibrium with rs11780156), were putatively functional variants for two of the five independent association signals. (Shi J, Zhang Y, Zheng W, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27087578">Fine-scale mapping of 8q24 locus identifies multiple independent risk variants for breast cancer</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2016)</p>
<h4>Genetic Susceptibility Locus</h4>
<p>A genome-wide association study identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) rs11249433 at 1p11.2 associated with breast cancer risk. To fine-map this locus, investigators genotyped 92 SNPs in a 900 kb region flanking rs11249433 in 45,276 breast cancer cases and 48,998 controls of European, Asian and African ancestry from 50 studies in the Breast Cancer Association Consortium. The strongest association observed was for the original identified index SNP rs11249433 and risk for ER-positive breast cancer. (Horne HN, Chung CC, Zhang H, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27556229">Fine-mapping of the 1p11.2 breast cancer susceptibility locus</a>. <em>PLoS One</em> 2016)</p>
<h4>Genetic Susceptibility and Terminal Duct Lobular Unit Involution</h4>
<p>Reduced levels of terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) involution, as reflected by higher numbers of TDLUs and acini per TDLU, have been associated with higher breast cancer risk. Previously, younger age at menarche and older age at menopause have been related to lower levels of TDLU involution. A pooled analysis of <em>a priori</em> selected single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and standardized TDLU involution measures demonstrated that a subset of SNPs previously found to be related to ages at menarche or menopause was also associated with standardized measures of TDLU involution, suggesting some shared genetic mechanisms. (Oh H, Bodelon C, Palakal M, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27342457">Ages at menarche- and menopause-related genetic variants in relation to terminal duct lobular unit involution in normal breast tissue</a>.<em> Breast Cancer Res Treat</em> 2016)</p>
<h4>Standardized Terminal Duct-Lobular Unit Involution Measures Predict Risk</h4>
<p>Lesser degrees of terminal duct-lobular unit (TDLU) involution predict higher breast cancer risk; however, standardized measures to quantitate levels of TDLU involution have only recently been developed. Investigators assessed whether three standardized measures of TDLU involution, with high intra/inter pathologist reproducibility in normal breast tissue, accurately predicted subsequent breast cancer risk among 99 women with benign breast disease. Standardized quantitative measures of TDLU counts and acini counts approximated by TDLU span measures or visually assessed in categories are independently associated with breast cancer risk. Visual assessment of TDLU numbers and acini content, which are highly reproducible between pathologists, could help identify women at high risk for subsequent breast cancer among the million women diagnosed annually with BBD in the US. (Figueroa JD, Pfeiffer RM, Brinton LA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27488681">Standardized measures of lobular involution and subsequent breast cancer risk among women with benign breast disease: A nested case-control study</a>.&nbsp;<em>Breast Cancer Res Treat</em> 2016)</p>
<h4>Tamoxifen and Risk of Contralateral Breast Cancer</h4>
<p>Using data from community healthcare settings (Kaiser Permanente Institute for Health Research - Colorado and Kaiser Permanente Northwest Center for Health Research - Oregon), investigators found that tamoxifen therapy was associated with reduced risk of contralateral breast cancer (CBC) during treatment and after its cessation, with risk progressively decreasing as tamoxifen therapy duration increased. If adjuvant endocrine therapy is indicated for breast cancer treatment, these findings in concert with trial data suggest that women should be encouraged to complete the full course.&nbsp; (Gierach GL, Curtis RE, Pfeiffer RM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27711920">Association of adjuvant tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor therapy with contralateral breast cancer risk among U.S. women with breast cancer in a general community setting</a>. <em>JAMA Oncol</em> 2016; Epub Oct 6, 2016)</p>
<h4>Tissue Microvessel Density</h4>
<p>In a study of 218 women referred for breast biopsy, increased microvessel density in breast tissue was associated with breast cancer, independently of mammographic density, consistent with magnetic resonance imaging findings suggestive of its possible value as a radiological cancer biomarker. (Felix AS, Lenz P, Pfeiffer R, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27552842">Relationships between mammographic density, tissue microvessel density, and breast biopsy diagnosis</a>. <em>Breast Cancer Res</em> 2016)</p>

<h4>Body Mass Index, Physical Activity, and Television Time</h4>
<p>Data on 580 women with endometrial cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study suggest that higher post-diagnosis body mass index (BMI) and TV viewing may be associated with higher mortality risk among EC patients, but that there may be complicated interrelationships between lifestyle factors of BMI, physical activity, and TV viewing and the mediating role of health status that need to be clarified. (Arem H, Pfeiffer RM, Moore SC, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27730319">Body mass index, physical activity, and television time in relation to mortality risk among endometrial cancer survivors in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort</a>. <em>Cancer Causes Control</em> 2016; Epub Oct 11, 2016)</p>
<h4>Inflammation Markers</h4>
<p>In a nested case-control study within the PLCO Screening Trial, baseline serum levels of 64 inflammation-related biomarkers were measured for 284 incident endometrial cancer cases and 284 matched controls. Several inflammation markers were prospectively associated with endometrial cancer, including adipokines, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic factors, and acute phase proteins. Inverse associations with anti-inflammatory markers (IL13, IL21), other inflammation markers/mediators (CCL3, IL1B, IL23), and a robust positive association between VEGFA and endometrial cancer risk were independent of BMI and estradiol, suggesting that these factors may influence risk through other mechanisms. (Trabert B, Eldridge RC, Pfeiffer RM, et al.&nbsp; <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770434">Pre-diagnostic circulating inflammation markers and endometrial cancer risk in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2016; Epub Oct 22, 2016)</p>

<h4>Survival Advantage of Prior Diagnosis of Barrett&rsquo;s Esophagus</h4>
<p>A case-case study to compare the clinical presentation, medical history, and survival of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) with and without a prior diagnosis of Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus (BE) was conducted using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Medicare database. EA cases occurring among individuals previously diagnosed with BE presented with less advanced disease, were more likely to undergo surgery and less likely to receive chemotherapy and radiotherapy, and had better overall mean survival than the large majority of EA cases that occur without a prior BE diagnosis. (Cook MB, Drahos J, Wood S, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27780192">Pathogenesis and progression of oesophageal adenocarcinoma varies by prior diagnosis of Barrett's oesophagus</a>. <em>Br J Cancer</em> 2016; Epub Oct 25, 2016)</p>
<h4>Vitamin B (Also under Stomach)</h4>
<p>B vitamins, which play an essential role in DNA synthesis and methylation, were found to have a possible protective effect against esophageal and gastric cancers in data from the General Population Nutrition Intervention Trial in Linxian, China. Subjects included 498 esophageal squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs), 255 gastric cardia adenocarcinomas (GCAs), and an age- and sex-matched sub-cohort of 947 individuals. Baseline serum riboflavin and vitamin B12 were inversely associated with risk of esophageal cancer, while higher flavin mononucleotide levels were significantly associated with increased risk of esophageal and gastric cancer. (Ren J, Murphy G, Fan J, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27748414">Prospective study of serum B vitamins levels and oesophageal and gastric cancers in China</a>. <em>Sci Rep</em> 2016; Epub Oct 17)</p>

<h3><a id="Gallbladder-Cancer"></a>Gallbladder</h3>
<h4>Inflammatory and Other Immune Markers</h4>
<p>Most gallbladder cancer (GBC) cases arise in the context of gallstones, which cause inflammation, but few gallstone patients develop GBC. Investigators assessed 65 immune-related markers in serum and bile from 41 GBC cases and 127 gallstone patients from Shanghai, China, followed by a replication study among 35 GBC cases and 31 gallstone controls from Chile. Among 15 markers elevated in both serum and bile from GBC versus gallstone patients in the Shanghai study, six were also significantly elevated in serum from Chile (CCL20, C-reactive protein, CXCL8, CXCL10, resistin, serum amyloid A). Further research on these markers may guide translational efforts to identify individuals at high risk of developing GBC.

<h4>Nonsynonymous Mutations and Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Responses</h4>
<p>Immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment represents a promising clinical approach and has been shown to be effective in a subset of melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and kidney cancers. Recent studies have suggested that the number of nonsynonymous mutations (NsM) can be used to select melanoma and NSCLC patients most likely to benefit from checkpoint inhibitor treatment. An assessment of NsM across 7,757 tumor samples drawn from 26 cancers sequenced in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project found that more than 30% of bladder, colon, gastric, and endometrial cancers have NsM counts above an empirically-derived threshold that was confirmed in melanoma and NSCLC. These data could inform the prioritization of tumor types for possible clinical trials to investigate further indications for effective use of immune checkpoint inhibitors. (Colli LM, Machiela MJ, Myers TA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197178">Burden of nonsynonymous mutations among tcga cancers and candidate immune checkpoint inhibitor responses</a>. <em>Cancer Res </em>2016)</p>

<h3><a id="Kidney-Cancer"></a>Kidney</h3>
<h4>Analgesic Use</h4>
<p>An investigation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) risk and analgesic use in the U.S. Kidney Cancer Study and the PLCO Screening Trial suggests that acetaminophen use may be associated with increased RCC risk. Use of NSAIDs and aspirin was not associated with RCC risk in either of the two studies. Updating a recent meta-analysis with these findings also supported an association between acetaminophen use and kidney cancer and RCC specifically, with comparable summary estimates for cohort and case-control studies.

<h4><strong>Functional Characterization of a Susceptibility Locus</strong></h4>
<p>Genome-wide association studies have identified multiple renal cell carcinoma susceptibility loci. Investigators used regional imputation and bioinformatics analysis of the 12p12.1 locus to identify the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs7132434 as a potential functional variant which upregulates BHLHE41 expression which, in turn, induces IL-11, a member of the IL-6 cytokine family.

<h3><a id="Liver-Cancer"></a>Liver</h3>
<h4>Insulin Resistance</h4>
<p>Insulin resistance likely increases the risk of chronic liver disease (CLD) and liver cancer, but long-term prospective studies with measured fasting glucose and insulin are lacking. Data from a prospective study of Finnish male smokers with follow-up time up to 22 years showed that baseline elevated fasting glucose and insulin, and insulin resistance were independently associated with risk of liver cancer and CLD mortality, suggesting a potentially important etiologic role for insulin and glucose dysregulation, even in the absence of diagnosed diabetes. (Loftfield E, Freedman ND, Lai GY, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27574287">Higher glucose and insulin levels are associated with risk of liver cancer and chronic liver disease mortality among men without a history of diabetes</a>. <em>Cancer Prev Res (Phila)</em> 2016)</p>

<h4><strong>Novel Genetic Susceptibility Locus</strong></h4>
<p>Epidemiologically related traits may share genetic risk factors, and pleiotropic analysis could identify individual loci associated with these traits. A pleiotropic analysis of genome-wide association studies of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease risk factors (blood lipids, type 2 diabetes, body mass index, and smoking) found that 6p22.1 (rs6904596, ZNF184) was associated with both lung cancer and blood triglycerides. The association was replicated in a lung cancer meta-analysis. The shared genetic risk factors between the two traits contributed to the uncovering of a hitherto unidentified genetic locus for lung cancer.

<h4>HIV (Also under Sarcoma)</h4>
<p>The biology of HIV-associated cancers may differ depending on immunologic and virologic context during development. Therefore, an understanding of the burden of Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) relative to antiretroviral therapy (ART), virologic suppression, and CD4 count is important. Patients with KS and NHL from eight clinical cohorts were identified among patients with HIV. Over time, KS and NHL occurred at higher CD4 counts and lower HIV RNA values, and KS occurred more frequently after ART initiation. These changes were driven by an increasing proportion of patients with HIV who received effective ART, had higher CD4 counts, and had suppressed HIV RNA and not by increases in cancer risk within these subgroups. An improved understanding of HIV-associated cancer pathogenesis and outcomes in the context of successful ART is therefore important. (Yanik EL, Achenbach CJ, Gopal S, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27507879">Changes in clinical context for Kaposi's sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma among people with HIV infection in the United States</a>. <em>J Clin Oncol</em> 2016)</p>
<h4>Medical Conditions</h4>
<p>The authors used a novel method&mdash;"medical condition-wide association study, or MedWAS"&mdash;to comprehensively evaluate medical risk factors for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) documented in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare data. They found 55 conditions variously associated with NHL. Examples included well-established associations of human immunodeficiency virus, solid organ transplantation, and hepatitis C virus with increased diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) risk, and autoimmune conditions with DLBCL and marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), along with some novel associations for NHL overall and NHL subtypes. (Engels EA, Parsons R, Besson C, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27197296">Comprehensive evaluation of medical conditions associated with risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma using Medicare claims ("MedWAS")</a>. <em>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</em> 2016)</p>
<h4>Whole Exome Sequencing</h4>
<p>Hodgkin lymphoma shows strong familial aggregation but no major susceptibility genes have been identified to date. Applying whole genome sequencing to members of Hodgkin lymphoma-prone families, investigators identified a causal mutation in the <em>KDR</em> gene, which is a type III receptor tyrosine kinase, the main mediator of vascular endothelial growth factor induced proliferation, survival, and migration. While independent validation is needed, this mutation may increase downstream tumor cell proliferation activity and might be a candidate for targeted therapy. (Rotunno M, McMaster ML, Boland J, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27365461">Whole exome sequencing in families at high risk for Hodgkin lymphoma: Identification of a predisposing mutation in the <em>KDR</em> gene</a>. <em>Haematologica</em> 2016)</p>

<h3><a id="Obesity"></a>Obesity</h3>
<h4>Body Mass Index (also under All Cause Mortality)</h4>
<p>Analysis of data pooled from 189 studies, representing over 10.5 million people from 32 countries, demonstrated body mass index (BMI) outside of the normal range (20-24.9) is associated with increased risk of mortality. The finding held across all areas of the world, with the absolute increases in risk for obese and moderately obese men higher than those among obese and moderately obese women, respectively. When the analysis was limited to never-smokers and excluded deaths in the first five years of follow-up, there was an increase in premature mortality among even overweight (BMI 25-29.9) persons, compared to those in the normal range.

<h3><a id="Pancreatic-Cancer"></a>Pancreas</h3>
<h4><strong>Functional Characterization of Risk Locus</strong></h4>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified multiple common susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer. Through fine-mapping and functional analysis of one such locus residing in a 610 kb gene desert on chr13q22.1 (marked by rs9543325), investigators identified a putative functional insertion/deletion variant at chr13q22.1 that associates with decreased DIS3 expression in carriers of pancreatic cancer risk-increasing alleles, and could therefore affect nuclear RNA processing and/or decay. (Hoskins JW, Ibrahim A, Emmanuel MA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27580880">Functional characterization of a chr13q22.1 pancreatic cancer risk locus reveals long-range interaction and allele-specific effects on DIS3 expression.</a> <em>Hum Mol Genet</em> 2016)</p>
<h4>Microbiome</h4>
<p>The relationship of oral microbiota with subsequent risk of pancreatic cancer was examined in a large nested case-control study within two prospective cohort studies. Using prediagnostic oral wash samples, carriage of oral pathogens, <em>Porphyromonas gingivalis</em> and <em>Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans</em>, were associated with higher risk of pancreatic cancer. Phylum <em>Fusobacteria</em> and its genus <em>Leptotrichia</em> were associated with decreased pancreatic cancer risk.&nbsp; (Fan X, Alekseyenko AV, Wu J, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27742762">Human oral microbiome and prospective risk for pancreatic cancer: a population-based nested case-control study</a>. <em>Gut</em> 2016; Epub Oct 14, 2016)</p>
<h4><strong>New Genetic Susceptibility Variants</strong></h4>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified common pancreatic cancer susceptibility variants at 13 chromosomal loci in individuals of European descent. To identify new variants, we performed imputation based on 1000 Genomes (1000G) Project data and association analysis using 5,107 case and 8,845 control subjects from 27 cohort and case-control studies that participated in the PanScan I-III GWAS. This analysis, in combination with a two-staged replication in additional subjects from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) and Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control (PanC4) Consortia uncovered three new pancreatic cancer risk signals marked by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2816938 at chromosome 1q32.1, rs10094872 at 8q24.21, and rs35226131 at 5p15.33. These SNPs represent independent risk variants at previously identified pancreatic cancer risk loci on chr1q32.1 (<em>NR5A2</em>), chr8q24.21 (<em>MYC</em>) and chr5p15.33 (<em>CLPTM1L-TERT</em>). (Zhang M, Wang Z, Obazee O, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27579533">Three new pancreatic cancer susceptibility signals identified on chromosomes 1q32.1, 5p15.33 and 8q24.21</a>. <em>Oncotarget </em>2016;)</p>
<h4>Prior Radiation Therapy</h4>
<p>Among 23,982 five-year survivors of testicular cancer (TC) diagnosed between 1947 and 1991, doses from radiotherapy to the pancreas were estimated for 80 pancreatic cancer patients and 145 matched controls. Cumulative incidence of second primary pancreatic cancer was 1.1% at 30 years after TC diagnosis. A dose-response relationship exists between radiation to the pancreas and subsequent cancer risk, and persists for over 20 years. These excesses, although small, should be considered when radiotherapy with exposure to the pancreas is considered for newly diagnosed patients. Additional data on chemotherapy are needed. (Hauptmann M, B&oslash;rge Johannesen T, Gilbert ES, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27599043">Increased pancreatic cancer risk following radiotherapy for testicular cancer</a>. <em>Br J Cancer</em> 2016)</p>

<h3><a id="Prostate"></a>Prostate</h3>
<h4>Body Mass Index</h4>
<p>Evidence suggests that obesity in adulthood is associated with increased risk of "clinically significant" prostate cancer. However, studies of body mass index (BMI) across the adult life course and prostate cancer risks remain limited. Data from a prospective cohort of 69,873 men in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial showed that BMI at age 20 years, 50 years, and baseline questionnaire (mean age = 63 years) were associated with increased risks of fatal prostate cancer. In five BMI trajectories identified, fatal prostate cancer risk was increased in men who had a normal BMI or who were overweight at age 20 years and developed obesity by baseline compared with men who maintained a normal BMI. Aggressive and nonaggressive prostate cancer were not associated with BMI, and modest inverse associations were seen for total prostate cancer. The results suggest that BMI trajectories during adulthood that result in obesity lead to an elevated risk of fatal prostate cancer.

<h4><strong>PLCO Tissue Resource</strong></h4>
<p>The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial undertook a large-scale effort to create a public resource of pathology tissues from PLCO participants who developed a cancer during the trial. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue blocks were obtained from pathology laboratories on a loan basis for central processing of tissue microarrays, with additional free-standing tissue cores collected for nucleic acid extraction. The methods and protocols developed for this effort, and the detailed description of this resource provided in this article will be useful for those seeking to use PLCO pathology tissue specimens for their research and may also inform future tissue collection efforts in other settings.

<p>There are almost 30,000 solid organ transplants performed each year in the United States. Transplantation is the treatment of choice for patients with end-stage organ failure, and while their life expectancy is extended, their risk for adverse health outcomes remains high. Although organ donors and recipients are matched on several factors before transplantation, there is no perfect match, apart from identical twins, resulting in a lifelong need for immunosuppressive medications. The drug cocktail used to prevent organ rejection results in a severely weakened immune system. In the immediate interval following transplantation and over the course of their lives, these individuals are at higher risk for many types of cancer, compared to the general population. Elevated risk is thought to arise from a combination of factors, such as persistent infection with carcinogenic viruses, chronic inflammation, coexisting medical conditions, and genotoxicity of the immunosuppression medications. By studying this population, epidemiologists can identify valuable clues about the role of the immune system in cancer etiology while helping clinicians and public health advisors develop screening and early detection approaches for these patients.</p>

<p>To document the pattern of malignancies, Dr. Engels and his team have assembled the largest study of cancer among transplant recipients in the world. As of 2016, they have linked the <a href="http://www.srtr.org/">U.S. transplant registry</a> with 17 state and metropolitan area cancer registries, covering more than 280,000 individuals, approximately 45% of the nation&rsquo;s organ recipients. Prior to this &ldquo;big data&rdquo; approach, many studies were based at single centers and relied on incomplete determination of cancers. Other linkage studies in Europe and Australia were much smaller (6,000-25,000 recipients), and some included only kidney recipients (the most commonly transplanted solid organ).</p>

In particular, Dr. Engels and colleagues showed that solid organ recipients in the U.S. experience a seven-fold increased risk of developing non-Hodgkin lymphoma, as well as elevated risk of 31 other individual types of cancer. In addition, the report refined risk estimates for recipients of specific transplanted organs.</p>
<p>The results gave insight into the etiology of certain cancers. For example, the team reported no increased risk of some of the most common cancers, such as breast, prostate, and ovarian cancers. This notable absence may indicate little or no role for immune system dysfunction in the development of these malignancies.</p>

<p>Following this initial investigation, Dr. Engels and his team went on to look more deeply into targeted subtopics, which have revealed further clues about cancer etiology as well as helped to direct screening guidelines. For instance, a study of cancer risk among patients with cystic fibrosis who received a lung transplant showed a 24-fold increased risk of colorectal cancer compared to the general population (in press at the <em>Journal of Cystic Fibrosis</em>). This greatly elevated risk probably reflects the effects of cystic fibrosis on the gastrointestinal tract, although an added effect of immunosuppression cannot be excluded. Notably, cystic fibrosis patients who received a lung transplant before age 50 had an absolute risk of developing colorectal cancer that was comparable to typical risk in the U.S. general population over age 50 (the age at which regular screening is recommended to begin). &ldquo;This information regarding the very high risk of colorectal cancer at younger ages is being used to develop new guidelines for screening, which will probably start around age 30 for this special population,&rdquo; says Dr. Engels.</p>

<p>Investigators noticed a pattern of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) risk associated with the cyclical nature of kidney function (transplant) and non-function (dialysis).</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) can be treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation. Patients can spend months or years on dialysis while waiting for a suitable match. If they are successfully transplanted, they move to a period when they have a functioning kidney. The transplanted kidney may fail, returning them to non-function, dialysis, and waiting. This cycle can repeat numerous times. During periods of kidney nonfunction, the dose of immunosuppression medication is low. Once a functioning kidney is transplanted, the patient undergoes intensive immunosuppression to prevent rejection.</p>
<p>In an analysis of ESRD patients, Elizabeth Yanik, Ph.D., a postdoctoral fellow in IIB; Dr. Engels, and colleagues noticed a pattern of cancer risk associated with the cyclical nature of kidney function and non-function experienced by these individuals (Yanik, 2016). They observed a &ldquo;sawtooth&rdquo; pattern of risk of certain cancers, with sharp increases during intervals of kidney function (i.e., transplantation) and sharp decreases during kidney non-function (i.e., dialysis). This provided strong evidence of tight connections between immunosuppression and several infection- and immune-related cancers, such as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer, and melanoma. There was an opposite pattern for kidney and thyroid cancers (i.e., higher risk during periods of dialysis, and a decline after transplantation), suggesting that the metabolic effects of kidney nonfunction, rather than immunosuppression, contribute to these cancers.</p>
<h3>The Role of Immunosuppression Medications and Immune Disturbances</h3>
<p>DCEG investigators have also examined the influence of particular medications on cancer risk. They noted elevated risk of several cancers associated with use of cyclosporine or azathioprine, two older immunosuppressive drugs that may directly increase DNA damage. In addition, transplant recipients often receive induction immunosuppressive therapy, which aims to prevent immediate organ rejection by drastically weakening the immune system. A team led by former IIB predoctoral fellow Hilary Robbins, M.S.P.H., noted an association between induction immunosuppression and risk of advanced-stage melanoma. These findings suggest intensive immunosuppression may have facilitated aggressive tumor behavior in undiagnosed, small melanomas present at the time of transplantation. Since melanomas can usually be detected with careful screening, these results highlight opportunities to catch melanomas at a stage when they can be removed.</p>
<h3>Molecular Epidemiology and Clues about Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma</h3>
<p>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the most common cancer in transplant recipients, comprises many distinct disease subtypes. Of these, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common; it is usually caused by loss of immune control of Epstein-Barr virus. Dr. Engels and colleagues examined the full spectrum of non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes in transplant recipients (Clarke, 2013), reporting excess risks for DLBCL and Burkitt lymphoma (also linked to Epstein-Barr virus), as well as rarer lymphoma subtypes. This pattern is the same in HIV-infected individuals, highlighting the importance of immunosuppression in the etiology of diverse lymphoma subtypes.</p>
<p>In another study, Dr. Engels and his team assessed risk of DLBCL in relation to human leukocyte antigen (HLA) patterns for organ donors and recipients. A mismatch in HLA proteins on the cell surface of donor tissue can signal to the immune system to attack the cell as &ldquo;foreign.&rdquo; There is enormous variability in HLA among humans, and although doctors try to match donors and recipients as closely as possible, some differences remain. When they compared donor and recipient HLA patterns and DLBCL in the recipient, the investigators found increased risk with increasing HLA mismatch. This result may reflect the need for higher doses of immunosuppressive medications in recipients with more HLA mismatch from their donors, or it could suggest that chronic immune stimulation from the donor organ contributes as an etiologic factor for DLBCL.</p>
<h3>Future Directions</h3>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: right; width: 25%; margin: 0 0 5px 10px;">
<p>&ldquo;Having an abnormal immune system probably predisposes a lot of people to develop different cancers, so what we&rsquo;ve discovered so far could be just the tip of the iceberg.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>As noted above, findings from the Transplant Cancer Match Study are already being used to revise cancer screening guidelines for transplant recipients. The incidence data and paired medical records also point the way toward deeper investigations: &ldquo;We take what we learn from database analyses and conduct molecular epidemiologic studies to understand the biological mechanisms that underlie those associations,&rdquo; said Dr. Engels. &ldquo;For example, we have been working with other transplant researchers to assess whether markers of immune stimulation are predictive of developing lymphoma.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Patterns of cancer incidence may change as treatment improves and the lifespan of immunosuppressed people increases. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re just now getting to understand the interplay between aging and immunosuppression in cancer risk,&rdquo; said Dr. Engels. Future research may also explore the pattern of cancer risk among people with more moderate cases of immune dysfunction. Their risk factors are less dramatic and may be harder to study, but the findings could be relevant to a greater percentage of the population. As Dr. Engels notes, &ldquo;having an abnormal immune system probably predisposes a lot of people to develop different cancers, so what we&rsquo;ve discovered so far could be just the tip of the iceberg.&rdquo;</p>

Initially, projects focused on candidate single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which relied on educated guesses to search for base pair variations drawn from particular genes that could be associated with cancer. The process was slow and ineffective. The development of massively parallel genotyping of SNPs on microarray chips revolutionized the scientific approach, enabling investigators to agnostically scan across the genome in search of markers that point to a region involved in cancer risk. This required larger scale studies and new biostatistical analysis techniques. CGR has also capitalized on advances in sequencing technologies that similarly can survey variation across target genes, the protein coding regions known as the exome, and more recently the entire genome. These new studies have required expertise in analyses of the germline DNA and have been extended to the somatic alterations characteristic of cancer genomes. Studies are also utilizing whole-genome methylation and RNA sequencing technologies to more fully elucidate the functional impact of genetic variation in cancer.</p>
<p>CGR leadership has developed a solid scientific foundation to conduct of a wide range of studies that includes expertise in sample handling, quality control metrics, bioinformatics and sophisticated genetic analyses.&nbsp;They have&nbsp;implemented and updated an elaborate information management system to handle the enormous amount of data generated, which already exceeds 4.5 petabytes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If someone had told me fifteen years ago that we&rsquo;d be accomplishing as much as we are today, I wouldn&rsquo;t have believed them,&rdquo; said Meredith Yeager, Ph.D., scientific director of CGR. &ldquo;The lab remains central to the international effort to understand how our DNA can affect our risk of cancer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At its founding in 2001, CGR, then known as the Core Genotyping Facility, was directed by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" sys_contentid="349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349630" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275159">Stephen Chanock, M.D.</a>, Director, DCEG and CGR, alongside a scientific and operations management team that included Dr. Yeager, the <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/17/AR2008031702577.html">late Robert Welch, M.B.A.</a>, deputy director, and Amy Hutchinson, M.S., director of operations. Belynda Hicks, M.S., deputy director, and Joseph Boland, M.B.A., director of research and development have since joined the lab. They are supported by an outstanding team of technicians, information and data management scientists, administrative support and quality control and project management staff.</p>
<p>Recently, CGR has turned its genetic expertise towards the analysis of the human papillomaviruses (HPV), which are known to cause cancer, particularly cervical cancer, but also at other sites in the body.&nbsp;They have shown that different types of the virus, and specific isolates within those types, have varying degrees of carcinogenicity. Studies of viral DNA sequences now point to which ones are most likely to lead to pre-cancer and cancer.</p>
<p>CGR continues to push the boundaries with both technological and analytical capabilities. Leveraging new sequencing applications from Oxford Nanopore, 10X Genomics and Pacific Biosciences allows CGR and DCEG to more fully assess structural variation, gene fusions and haplotype analysis. New efforts in microbiome research are poised to elucidate the connection between cancer and microbial diversity. Molecular and digital pathology capabilities are planned to be added over the next year, and will allow&nbsp;our investigators&nbsp;to leverage the rich specimen resources available within the Division. CGR and DCEG promise to continue to identify and apply the newest and most advanced laboratory and bioinformatics tools to explore germline and somatic contributions to cancer.</p>

<p>In October, organizers of the DCEG Applied Epidemiology Seminar Series hosted a seminar on biomarkers for early detection of ovarian cancer. The event included an invited talk by Steven Skates, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Medicine (Biostatistics) at the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, entitled &ldquo;Early Detection for Ovarian Cancer: From CA-125 to ROCA to UKCTOCS,&rdquo; and presentations from three discussants well versed in biomarker and clinical research who provided a multi-disciplinary perspective: <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=33&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349668" sys_contentid="349668" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275519" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349668" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475">Nicolas Wentzensen, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, of DCEG, Lori Minasian, M.D., of the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention, and Lisa M. McShane, Ph.D., of the NCI Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.</p>
<p>Early detection of ovarian cancer has the potential to improve the poor mortality statistics which make it the fifth leading cause of cancer death in the US and the leading cause of death for women with reproductive organ cancers. At the time CA-125 was discovered there were hopes that this biomarker, elevated in many ovarian cancers, could be used&nbsp; for screening. Single threshold measures or results from algorithms like the Risk of Ovarian Cancer Algorithm (ROCA), developed by Dr. Skates and colleagues, have shown promise.</p>
<p>Dr. Skates, who disclosed his nature as an &ldquo;eternal optimist&rdquo; as a possible conflict of interest, outlined three decades of study, including results from UKCTOCS, a large, randomized trial of ROCA and ultrasound screening in the United Kingdom, and potential pitfalls and future directions of epidemiologic, biomarker and genomic research on this cancer.</p>
<p>Moderator Christine Berg, M.D., DCEG consultant, led a lively post-presentation discussion and question-and-answer session.</p>

<p>Dr. Mustafa Dosemeci, retired senior investigator in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, died October 10, 2016, after a long illness. Over the course of 22 years in the Division, Dr. Dosemeci integrated his training in chemistry and industrial hygiene to develop exposure assessment methodologies for a wide range of epidemiological studies of chemical and physical hazards. Some of his major contributions included assessments of potential carcinogens such as benzene, silica, and diesel exhaust.</p>
<p>Dr. Dosemeci possessed an irrepressible enthusiasm and &lsquo;can-do&rsquo; approach to research challenges. This is perhaps best exemplified by his optimism, recalled by former co-worker Richard Hayes, Ph.D.: &ldquo;He was absolutely committed to characterizing the level of benzene exposure experienced over several decades for over 70,000 workers in 12 cities in China.&rdquo; The results of this Herculean effort led to the publication of over 30 highly influential papers that have been cited more than 2,000 times, and ultimately <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/public-health-impact/benzene-exposures-toxicity-carcinogenicity">a rule change by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</a> establishing a limit for benzene content in gasoline and adopting controls on passenger vehicles and portable fuel containers. This is one example of his many accomplishments, always with the greatest enthusiasm and pleasure in his work.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>He led a seminal study of 68,000 workers exposed to silica in China, cited as a key reference for the International Agency for Cancer Research classification of silica as a human carcinogen. He was the &ldquo;founding&rdquo; exposure assessment expert on a study of diesel-exposed miners that provided the key piece of evidence that led to diesel exhaust being classified as a &ldquo;known human carcinogen&rdquo;.</p>
<p>He developed new methods and approaches for assessing exposures, which was particularly innovative in the Agricultural Health Study; he accounted for pesticide type, application method, protective equipment, personal work and hygiene practices, and other factors. In other work, he used simulation approaches to develop specific recommendations for industrial hygienists to reduce the effects of misclassification on risk estimates and also noted how in some circumstances misclassification could produce results that were biased away from the null.</p>
<p>But Dr. Dosemeci was not content to &ldquo;stay on the exposure side of the ledger,&rdquo; recalled former Deputy Director <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=18&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349600" sys_contentid="349600" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349600" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276307">Shelia Zahm, Sc.D.</a> &ldquo;He was passionate about getting involved in the epidemiologic &lsquo;side&rsquo; of studies, too.&rdquo; For example, Dr. Dosemeci was responsible for initiating a major collaborative effort to study bladder cancer in Spain, piggy-backing onto an existing study of bladder cancer survival. In doing so, he launched a collaboration that has led to a new understanding of the relationships between exposures, such as chlorination and other disinfection byproducts, and genetics in the etiology of bladder cancer.</p>
<p>He was passionate in his pursuit and was well known for the attention he afforded the details of a study or analysis.

<p>In November 2016, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/chaturvedi-anil">Anil Chaturvedi, Ph.D.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH, and promoted to senior investigator in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB). Dr. Chaturvedi studies the molecular epidemiology of cancers of the head and neck and lung to address research questions on etiology, natural history, and risk prediction.</p>
<p>In the arena of head and neck cancer research, Dr. Chaturvedi is evaluating how risk factors for the disease give rise to cancers within different subsites in the head and neck. His research has helped characterize the importance of HPV infection patterns as an explanation for the recent rise in oropharyngeal cancers in developed countries. More recently, he has focused on studies to characterize the patterns and determinants of progression of oral cavity precursors to cancer and approaches to decrease the burden of oral cavity cancers worldwide. He is also working collaboratively to identify an HPV-induced precursor lesion in the oropharynx, the absence of which has been a critical limitation for secondary prevention.</p>
<p>Dr. Chaturvedi's second research focus is on lung cancer etiology and risk prediction. In collaboration with <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/katki-hormuzd">Hormuzd A. Katki, Ph.D.</a>, senior investigator in the Biostatistics Branch, he conducted <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2014-03/research-publications/lung-cancer-screening">a series of studies focused on risk-based lung cancer</a> screening to improve the efficiency of screening programs. His work has also contributed substantially to the understanding of the role of chronic inflammation and lung cancer.</p>

<p>For example, a team of NCI investigators led by Debbie Winn, Ph.D., now Deputy Director of the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, noticed an extremely high concentration of oral and pharynx cancer in white females in the southeastern part of the United States between 1950 and 1969. They initially considered exposures resulting from the region&rsquo;s textile industry. Later, they explored snuff dipping, placing ground tobacco between the gum and cheek, which was very popular among rural Southern women at the time. A subsequent field study revealed that long-term snuff use was associated with up to a 50-fold risk of oral and pharynx cancer compared to the general population. This challenged the then-held notion that snuff was a safer alternative to cigarettes.</p>

<p>While such large swaths of elevated cancer rates tend to draw the eye, Drs. Fraumeni and Hoover emphasized the importance of &ldquo;outliers&rdquo; &ndash; small spots of high incidence or mortality in areas with otherwise low or typical rates. A map of lung cancer deaths showed a notable concentration along much of the East Coast in the 1950&rsquo;s and 60&rsquo;s, which was linked to the detrimental late effects of asbestos exposure among shipbuilders during World War II. Investigating smaller abnormalities of the map also yielded important results&ndash;an isolated blip of red in Montana led to the implication of a nearby copper smelter, which was exposing workers and residents to high levels of arsenic. This discovery prompted new regulatory standards to protect workers.</p>
<p>Time trends are also an important tool, as Dr. Fraumeni illustrated with breast cancer incidence patterns over time, and racial disparities brought to light by data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.</p>

<p>Dr. Hoover concluded with his view of the most promising avenues in the field. Evaluation of changes in geographical and time trends can be enhanced with the inclusion of refined disease classifications. New data resources are also valuable, such as environmental exposure patterns like air pollution that may be mapped to individual communities, even specific residences. He also spoke enthusiastically about the development of new methods for analysis of &ldquo;big data&rdquo; that can help investigators take on increasingly larger studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The seminar was very well received by the over 200 people in attendance. We look forward to many more seminars, and for opportunities to showcase descriptive epidemiology as a tool that combines cancer surveillance and etiologic research,&rdquo; said Dr. Shiels.</p>

<p>People who consistently smoked an average of less than one cigarette per day over their lifetime had a 64 percent higher risk of earlier death than never smokers, and those who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes a day had an 87 percent higher risk of earlier death than never smokers, according to a new study from researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Risks were lower among former low-intensity smokers compared to those who were still smokers, and risk fell with earlier age at quitting. The results of the study were reported December 5, 2016, in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em>. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>When researchers looked at specific causes of death among study participants, a particularly strong association was observed for lung cancer mortality. Those who consistently averaged less than one cigarette per day over their lifetime had nine times the risk of dying from lung cancer than never smokers. Among people who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes per day, the risk of dying from lung cancer was nearly 12 times higher than that of never smokers.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at risk of death from respiratory disease, such as emphysema, as well as the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. People who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes a day had over six times the risk of dying from respiratory diseases than never smokers and about one and&nbsp;one-half times the risk of dying of cardiovascular disease than never smokers.</p>

<p>Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have identified novel genomic and molecular characteristics of cervical cancer that will aid in subclassification of the disease and may help target therapies that are most appropriate for each patient. The new study, a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of 178 primary cervical cancers, found that over 70 percent of the tumors had genomic alterations in either one or both of two important cell signaling pathways. The researchers also found, unexpectedly, that a subset of tumors did not show evidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The study was conducted by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network and included authors from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genomic Research Institute (NHGRI), both parts of the National Institutes of Health, appeared&nbsp;January 23, 2017 in <em>Nature</em>.</p>

<p>In September 2016, DCEG investigators hosted a workshop on esophageal cancer co-organized by the NCI and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). The goal of the workshop was to examine the state of the science on esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) with regard to etiology, genetic risk factors, early detection and treatment, and palliative care, and to identify gaps in our understanding and the related critical research questions. The two-day meeting began with introductions from Division Director <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349630" sys_relationshipid="7260554" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349630">Stephen J.

<p>ESCC makes up the vast majority of esophageal cancer cases worldwide. The geographic distribution is extraordinarily uneven, with high incidence regions stretching across central Asia from China to Iran, from eastern to southern Africa, and parts of South America. Topics of discussion ranged from descriptive epidemiology and genetic studies to early detection and treatment. <a href="http://www.iarc.fr/en/meetings/tumourseminar/esophageal/">The detailed agenda and copies of the slides used in the presentations are available on the IARC website.</a></p>

<p>In a departure from the typical &ldquo;big data&rdquo; approach of genome wide association studies&mdash;sampling tens- or even hundreds of thousands of people to look for common inherited variation associated with risk of disease&mdash;scientists from around the world have collaborated to learn from an individual case, carefully documented by an international group of scientists over nearly 30 years. The team, led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=17&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=966087" sys_contentid="966087" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="966087" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7277184">Michael Dean, Ph.D.</a>, of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at NCI, charted changes in cancer cells through the course of disease for a female patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), treated at the NIH Clinical Center. CLL is the most common leukemia in adults; it tends to progress slowly, in this case affording researchers the opportunity to delve into the genetic characteristics of each stage.</p>
<p>The patient was diagnosed at age 47 in the early 1970&rsquo;s. From 1984 until 2000 she was seen regularly by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=22&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349591" sys_contentid="349591" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349591" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7277185">Neil Caporaso, M.D.</a>, senior investigator in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, as part of a family study of lymphoproliferative disorders. He worked closely with another CLL expert from the FDA, Dr. Gerald Marti, to manage her care, and together they published studies describing her cell morphology, differences and similarities between familial and sporadic CLL, and characteristics of familial CLL. Emblematic of the importance of the CLL families, her cells would later contribute to larger studies of chromosomal mosaicism, genome-wide association studies and exome sequencing in familial CLL. &ldquo;We are deeply grateful to all participants in our family studies program whose generosity allows us to do this type of intensive interdisciplinary research, often without personal benefit to themselves,&rdquo; said <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=33&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349685" sys_contentid="349685" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349685" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7277186">Margaret&nbsp;Tucker, M.D.</a>, Director, Human Genetics Program. &ldquo;We could not do this without them.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>As is common with CLL, the patient experienced extended periods of good health following effective treatments. In a remarkable display of foresight, Dr. Caporaso and&nbsp;Dr. Tucker took steps to collect and freeze tumor cells over the last 18 years of the 29-year disease course. CLL is particularly opportune for these studies because the tumor circulates in the blood, so carefully collected samples can later be cell sorted to obtain samples of both normal and tumor cells for analysis. At the time sample collection began, there were few research tools available to study the different cell types.</p>
<p>Using such varied techniques as single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray analyses, transcriptome sequencing and whole genome sequencing, investigators describe, in a paper published December 16, 2016, in <em>Nature Communications</em>, the branching mutational path of the patient&rsquo;s cancer cells. Six overall mutation profiles, or clusters, emerged throughout the disease course and varied in relative percentage from year to year. These clusters were characterized by particular DNA abnormalities such as SNP and gene deletions or duplications, or the emergence of extra chromosomes. Close examination of these patterns, such as which mutations occur together, could reveal details about the molecular mechanics of cancer evolution. &ldquo;One of the more surprising observations,&rdquo; noted Dr. Dean, &ldquo;is that certain chromosome alterations tracked closely to treatment patterns. We saw specific chromosome changes appear immediately following therapy, suggesting the ability of cancer cells to adapt to and resist treatments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A new breast cancer model, published today in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, will help health care providers more accurately predict breast cancer risk in their Hispanic patients.</p>
<p>The model, developed by a Kaiser Permanente researcher and his colleagues, is the first to be based exclusively on data from Hispanic women and will become part of the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s online tool that helps providers calculate breast cancer risk in individual patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hispanics are the largest racial/ethnic minority group in the U.S., so it&rsquo;s important that the NCI tool include information from these women in determining their risk score. Our model does that because it is based on data from Hispanic women and specifically tailored for them,&rdquo; said Matthew P. Banegas, PhD, MPH, lead author and researcher from the Kaiser Permanente Center for Health Research.</p>

<p>In December 2016, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349649" sys_contentid="349649" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349649" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276345">Joshua Sampson, Ph.D.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH, and promoted to senior investigator in the Biostatistics Branch. Dr. Sampson focuses on the design and analysis of studies evaluating genetic, metabolomic, and epidemiologic associations with cancer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With his background in statistics and biology, Dr. Sampson has developed an innovative research portfolio in molecular epidemiology and made key contributions to numerous studies. Since joining the Division, he has introduced new study designs to improve the efficiency of next-generation sequencing, developed a testing framework for identifying associations with groups of rare single nucleotide polymorphisms, and designed new methods for analyzing subgroup-specific genetic effects.</p>
<p>He has led three large studies of cancer genetics including a large multi-stage and multi-platform genome-wide association study (GWAS) of prostate cancer and, more recently, a study of shared heritability across thirteen cancer types. In an ongoing effort, he is leading a GWAS for the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study in collaboration with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=30&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349616" sys_contentid="349616" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349616" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276346">Lindsay Morton, Ph.D.</a>, to find variants associated with development of secondary neoplasms after treatment.</p>
<p>Dr. Sampson is a leader in the emerging field of metabolomics as it applies to cancer etiology, particularly in high-quality prospective cohort studies. Together with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=24&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=638988" sys_contentid="638988" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="638988" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276347">Steven Moore, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, he started the DCEG Metabolomics Initiative. The aims of the Initiative are to identify metabolites or small biological molecules associated with the risk of cancer or risk factors for cancer, and metabolites that mediate the relationship between known risk factors and cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>More recently, Dr. Sampson has become the lead statistician on a new NCI trial comparing one and two doses of the bivalent and nonavalent prophylactic human papillomavirus vaccines; he is playing a crucial role in designing this large non-inferiority trial. Ultimately, the findings from this study will influence international public health organizations responsible for vaccination guidelines worldwide.</p>

<h3><a id="All-Cause-Mortality"></a>All-Cause Mortality</h3>
<h4>Tobacco</h4>
<p>Data on 290,215 adults in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study showed that individuals who smoke fewer than 1, or 1 to 10 cigarettes per day over their lifetime have higher mortality risks than never smokers and would benefit from cessation. These results provide further evidence that there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke. (Inoue-Choi M, Liao LM, Reyes-Guzman C, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27918784">Association of long-term, low-intensity smoking with all-cause and cause-specific mortality in the National Institutes of Health-AARP Diet and Health Study</a>. <em>JAMA Intern Med</em> 2017)</p>
<h4>Trends in Premature Mortality</h4>
<p>An analysis of mortality in the U.S. between 1999 and 2014 among people aged 25-64 years showed that important public health successes, including HIV treatment and smoking cessation, have contributed to declining premature mortality in Hispanic individuals, black individuals, and Asians and Pacific Islanders. However, this progress has largely been negated among young and middle-aged (25-49 years) white individuals, and American Indians and Alaska Natives, primarily due to drug poisonings, suicide, and chronic liver disease and cirrhosis. (Shiels MS, Chernyavskiy P, Anderson WF, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28131493">Trends in premature mortality in the USA by sex, race, and ethnicity from 1999 to 2014: An analysis of death certificate data</a>. <em>Lancet</em> 2017; Epub Jan 26) Read more about these trends in the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2017/premature-death-rates-diverge">NCI press release</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="Bladder"></a>Bladder</h3>
<h4>Smoking and Occupation</h4>
<p>Using data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project on 406 patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer, investigators found that current smoking and employment in a high-risk occupation&mdash;one with probable diesel exhaust exposure, or in production occupations&mdash;are related to increased risk of recurrence. (Wilcox AN, Silverman DT, Friesen MC, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27804056">Smoking status, usual adult occupation, and risk of recurrent urothelial bladder carcinoma: Data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Project</a>. <em>Cancer Causes Control</em> 2016)</p>

<h3><a id="Breast"></a>Breast</h3>
<h4>Diabetes and Dyslipidemia</h4>
<p>Using the SEER-Medicare database, investigators found that diabetes was associated with increased risk of distant inflammatory breast cancer (IBC), distant and regional locally advanced non-IBC, and distant and unstaged other breast cancers. Dyslipidemia was associated with reduced risk of IBC and other breast cancers except localized disease. Results were similar by tumor estrogen receptor status. Abnormal glucose levels and hypertension had little association with risk of any tumor type. (Schairer C, Gadalla SM, Pfeiffer RM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28087608">Diabetes, abnormal glucose, dyslipidemia, hypertension and risk of inflammatory and other breast cancer</a>. <em>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</em> 2017; Epub Jan 13)</p>
<h4>Estrogen Metabolism</h4>
<p>Endogenous estradiol and estrone are linked causally to increased risks of breast cancer. Prediagnostic concentrations of estradiol, estrone, and 13 metabolites were measured in 1298 cases of postmenopausal breast cancer and 1524 matched controls to evaluate how metabolism of the parent estrogens may influence risk. Total estrogen levels (summing all 15 estrogens/estrogen metabolites) were associated strongly and positively with breast cancer risk. A relative increase in levels of 2-hydroxylation pathway metabolites, or in the ratio of 2-hydroxylation:16-hydroxylation pathway metabolites, was associated inversely with breast cancer risk. These associations varied by total estrogen levels, with the largest risk reductions occurring in women in the highest tertile. The findings suggest opportunities for breast cancer prevention by modifying individual estrogen metabolism profiles through either lifestyle alterations or chemopreventive strategies. (Sampson JN, Falk RT, Schairer C, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28011624">Association of estrogen metabolism with breast cancer risk in different cohorts of postmenopausal women</a>. <em>Cancer Res</em> 2016; Epub Dec 23)</p>
<h4>Genetic Variation and Terminal Duct Lobular Unit Involution</h4>
<p>Terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) are the predominant source of future breast cancers, and lack of TDLU involution (higher TDLU counts, higher acini count per TDLU and the product of the two) is a breast cancer risk factor. Single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with breast cancer risk in earlier research were not found to strongly influence TDLU involution in a pooled analysis of 872 women from two studies. (Bodelon C, Oh H, Chatterjee N, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27859137">Association between breast cancer genetic susceptibility variants and terminal duct lobular unit involution of the breast</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2017)</p>

<h4>Serum Choline Levels</h4>
<p>The authors evaluated the relationship between baseline serum concentrations of TMAO, a choline-derived metabolite produced by gut microbiota, and its biomarker precursors (choline, carnitine and betaine) and incident colorectal cancer risk in a nested case-control study of male smokers in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study. Higher serum choline concentration (but not TMAO, carnitine, or betaine) was associated with increased risk of colorectal cancer. Men with higher serum choline at ATBC baseline had approximately 3-fold greater risk of developing colorectal cancer over the ensuing 14 &plusmn;10 years. The prognostic value of serum choline for prediction of incident colorectal cancer development was similarly robust for proximal, distal and rectal colon cancers (Guertin KA, Li XS, Graubard BI, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077427">Serum trimethylamine N-oxide, carnitine, choline and betaine in relation to colorectal cancer risk in the Alpha Tocopherol and Beta Carotene Study</a>. <em>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</em> 2017; Epub Jan 11)</p>

<h3><a id="Endometrium"></a>Endometrium</h3>
<h4>Inflammation Markers</h4>
<p>In a nested case-control study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial, investigators measured serum levels of 64 inflammation-related biomarkers in 284 incident endometrial cancer cases and 284 matched controls. Several inflammation markers were prospectively associated with endometrial cancer, including adipokines, pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, angiogenic factors and acute phase proteins. Inverse associations with anti-inflammatory markers (IL13, IL21), other inflammation markers/mediators (CCL3, IL1B, IL23), and a robust positive association between VEGFA and endometrial cancer risk were independent of BMI and estradiol, suggesting that these factors may influence risk through other mechanisms. (Trabert B, Eldridge RC, Pfeiffer RM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27770434">Prediagnostic circulating inflammation markers and endometrial cancer risk in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2017)</p>
<h4>Nonsteroidal Anti-inflammatory Drugs</h4>
<p>Recent data suggest that the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be associated with reductions in endometrial cancer risk, yet very few have examined whether their use is related to prognosis among endometrial cancer patients. Data on 4,374 participants of the NRG Oncology/Gynecology Oncology Group 210 Study with endometrial carcinoma showed that use of NSAIDs was associated with increased endometrial carcinoma-specific mortality, especially in patients with type I tumors. (Brasky TM, Felix AS, Cohn DE, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27986878">Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and endometrial carcinoma mortality and recurrence</a>. <em>J Natl Cancer Inst</em> 2017; Epub Dec 16, 2016)</p>

<h3><a id="Esophagus"></a>Esophagus</h3>
<h4>Metabolic Syndrome</h4>
<p>Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is associated with cancer risk and increases the risk of Barrett esophagus, the precursor lesion of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA), primarily in the absence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare-linked database showed that MetS was associated with an increased risk of EA in males without GERD and females regardless of GERD status. There was no association when compared with Barrett esophagus controls. MetS may impact EA risk by primarily increasing the risk of the precursor lesion, Barrett esophagus. (Drahos J, Ricker W, Pfeiffer RM, Cook M. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27861759">Metabolic syndrome and risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma in elderly patients in the United States: An analysis of SEER-Medicare data</a>. <em>Cancer</em> 2017; Epub Nov 8, 2016)</p>

<h3><a id="Genetics"></a>Genetics</h3>
<h4>Telomere Length</h4>
<p>Summary data from 103 genome-wide association studies showed that increased telomere length due to germline genetic variation was generally associated with increased risk for site-specific cancers, notably glioma, serous low-malignant-potential ovarian cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, neuroblastoma, melanoma, and cancers of the bladder, testes, kidney, and endometrium. Associations were stronger for rarer cancers and at tissue sites with lower rates of stem cell division. There was generally little evidence of association between genetically increased telomere length and risk of psychiatric, autoimmune, inflammatory, diabetic, and other non-neoplastic diseases, except for reduced risk for coronary heart disease, abdominal aortic aneurysm, celiac disease, and interstitial lung disease. (Telomeres Mendelian Randomization Collaboration, Haycock PC, Burgess S, Nounu A, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28241208">Association between telomere length and risk of cancer and non-neoplastic diseases: A Mendelian randomization study</a>. <em>JAMA Oncol</em> 2017; Epub Feb 23)</p>
<h3><a id="Leukemia"></a>Leukemia</h3>
<h4>Clonal Evolution</h4>
<p>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a frequent B-cell malignancy, characterized by recurrent somatic chromosome alterations and a low level of point mutations. Investigators presented single-nucleotide polymorphism microarray analyses of a single CLL patient over 29 years of observation and treatment, and transcriptome and whole-genome sequencing at selected time points. They identified chromosome alterations 13q14-, 6q- and 12q+ in early cell clones, elimination of clonal populations following therapy, and subsequent appearance of a clone containing trisomy 12 and chromosome 10 copy-neutral loss of heterogeneity that marks a major population dominant at death. Serial single-cell RNA sequencing reveals an expression pattern with high FOS, JUN and KLF4 at disease acceleration, which resolves following therapy, but reoccurs following relapse and preceding death. Transcriptome evolution indicates complex changes in expression occur over time. In conclusion, in this case of CLL the disease evolved gradually during indolent phases, and underwent rapid changes following therapy. (Zhao Z, Goldin L, Liu S, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27982015">Evolution of multiple cell clones over a 29-year period of a CLL patient</a>. <em>Nat Commun</em> 2016; Epub Dec 16).

<h4>Dysregulation of Immunity Genes</h4>
<p>A meta-analysis of six genome-wide association studies of chronic lymphocytic leukemia identified nine risk loci at 1p36.11 (rs34676223), 1q42.13 (rs41271473), 4q24 (rs71597109), 4q35.1 (rs57214277), 6p21.31 (rs3800461), 11q23.2 (rs61904987), 18q21.1 (rs1036935), 19p13.3 (rs7254272), and 22q13.33 (rs140522). These new and established risk loci map to areas of active chromatin and show an over-representation of transcription factor binding for the key determinants of B-cell development and immune response. (Law PJ, Berndt SI, Speedy HE, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28165464">Genome-wide association analysis implicates dysregulation of immunity genes in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia</a>. <em>Nat Commun</em> 2017; Epub Feb 6)</p>

<h4>Germline Variants and <em>EGFR</em> Mutations</h4>
<p>To evaluate associations by <em>EGFR</em> mutation status for lung adenocarcinoma risk among never-smoking Asian women, investigators conducted a meta-analysis of 11 loci previously identified in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Genotyping in an additional 10,780 never-smoking cases and 10,938 never-smoking controls from Asia confirmed associations with eight known single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two new signals were observed at genome-wide significance: rs7216064 (17q24.3, <em>BPTF</em>), for overall lung adenocarcinoma risk, and rs3817963 (6p21.3, <em>BTNL2</em>) which is specific to cases with <em>EGFR</em> mutations. In further sub-analyses by <em>EGFR</em> status, rs9387478 (<em>ROS1</em>-<em>DCBLD1</em>) and rs2179920 (<em>HLA</em>-<em>DPB1</em>) showed stronger estimated associations in <em>EGFR</em>-positive compared to <em>EGFR</em>-negative cases. Comparison of the overall associations with published results in Western populations revealed that the majority of these findings were distinct, underscoring the importance of distinct contributing factors for smoking and non-smoking lung cancer. (Seow WJ, Matsuo K, Hsiung CA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28025329">Association between GWAS-identified lung adenocarcinoma susceptibility loci and EGFR mutations in never-smoking Asian women, and comparison with findings from Western populations</a>. <em>Hum Mol Genet</em> 2016; Epub Dec 26)</p>
<h4>Nut Consumption</h4>
<p>Higher frequency of nut consumption was inversely associated with overall lung cancer risk, regardless of smoking status, in the Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study, a population-based case-control study, and the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, a prospective cohort. Results from the prospective cohort showed similar associations across histological subtypes, and more pronounced benefits from nut consumption for those who smoked 1-20 cigarettes/day. (Lee JT, Lai GY, Liao LM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28077426">Nut consumption and lung cancer risk: Results from two large observational studies</a>. <em>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</em> 2017; Epub Jan 11)</p>

<h4>Dietary Patterns</h4>
<p>Healthy dietary patterns that conform to national dietary guidelines are related to lower chronic disease incidence and longer life span. However, the precise mechanisms involved are unclear. This study examined the correlation of four diet quality indexes (the Healthy Eating Index 2010, the Alternate Mediterranean Diet Score, the WHO Healthy Diet Indicator, and the Baltic Sea Diet) with serum metabolites among participants in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene (ATBC) Cancer Prevention Study cohort. Diet quality, measured by healthy diet indexes, was associated with serum metabolites, with the specific metabolite profile of each diet index related to the diet components used to score adherence. (Playdon MC, Moore SC, Derkach A, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28031192">Identifying biomarkers of dietary patterns by using metabolomics</a>. <em>Am J Clin Nutr</em> 2016; Epub Dec 28)</p>

<h4>Microbiome</h4>
<p>There is increasing interest in studying the relationship between the microbiome and human health and disease. To aid in the design of future prospective cohort studies of the fecal microbiome, investigators determined technical reproducibility, stability at ambient temperature, and accuracy of five fecal collection methods (no additive, 95% ethanol, RNAlater Stabilization Solution, fecal occult blood test cards, and fecal immunochemical test tubes). All the fecal sample collection methods appear relatively reproducible, stable, and accurate. (Vogtmann E, Chen J, Amir A, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27986704">Comparison of collection methods for fecal samples in microbiome studies</a>. <em>Am J Epidemiol</em> 2017; Epub Dec 16, 2016)</p>
<h4>Polygenic Risk Modeling</h4>
<p>Recent heritability analyses have indicated that genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have the potential to improve risk prediction for complex diseases based on polygenic risk score (PRS), a simple modelling technique that can be implemented using summary-level data from discovery samples. The investigators propose modifications to improve the performance of PRS. They introduce threshold-dependent winner's-curse adjustments for marginal association coefficients that are used to weight the single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in PRS. Further, as a way to incorporate external functional/annotation knowledge that could identify subsets of SNPs highly enriched for associations, they propose variable thresholds for SNPs selection. Applying the methods, a simple winner's curse correction uniformly led to enhancement of performance of the models, whereas incorporation of functional SNPs was beneficial only for selected diseases. Compared to the standard PRS algorithm, the proposed methods in combination led to notable gain in efficiency (25-50% increase in the prediction R2) for five of 14 diseases. The simulation studies illustrate why differential treatment of certain categories of functional SNPs, even when shown to be highly enriched for GWAS-heritability, does not lead to proportionate improvement in genetic risk-prediction because of non-uniform linkage disequilibrium structure. (Shi J, Park JH, Duan J, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28036406">Winner's curse correction and variable thresholding improve performance of polygenic risk modeling based on genome-wide association study summary-level data</a>. <em>PLoS Genet</em> 2016)</p>

<h4>Biomarkers by Smoking Status</h4>
<p>Circulating concentrations of C-peptide and total adiponectin, two biomarkers related to obesity and insulin secretion and sensitivity, were evaluated in relation to risk of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) in a pooled nested case-control analysis of data from three prospective cohorts. Circulating C-peptide concentration was not associated with PDA among never or former smokers, but was inversely associated with PDA among current smokers. High molecular weight adiponectin was inversely associated among never smokers, not associated in former smokers, and positively associated in smokers. Total adiponectin was not associated with PDA in nonsmokers or current smokers. Smoking-induced pancreatic damage may explain the associations among smokers while mechanisms related to insulin resistance may explain associations in non-smokers. (Nogueira LM, Newton CC, Pollak MN, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28096201">Serum C-peptide, total and high molecular weight adiponectin, and pancreatic cancer: Do associations differ by smoking</a>? <em>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</em> 2017; Epub Jan 17)</p>

<h4>Genetic Loci for Prostate-Specific Antigen Levels</h4>
<p>Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels have been used for detection and surveillance of prostate cancer (PCa). However, factors other than PCa, such as genetics, can impact PSA. A genome-wide association study of PSA detected 40 genome-wide significant single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs): 19 novel, 15 previously identified for PSA (14 of which were also PCa-associated), and 6 previously identified for PCa only. Further analysis incorporating PCa cases suggests that at least half of the 40 SNPs are PSA-associated independent of PCa. The 40 SNPs explain 9.5% of PSA variation in non-Hispanic whites, and the remaining SNPs explain an additional 31.7%; this percentage is higher in younger men, supporting the genetic basis of PSA levels. These findings provide important information about genetic markers for PSA that may improve PCa screening, thereby reducing overdiagnosis and overtreatment.

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility and Pesticides</h4>
<p>Using data from the Agricultural Health Study, investigators evaluated whether single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) involved in hormone homeostasis alter the effect of pesticide exposure on prostate cancer risk. There was an interaction, which remained significant after correction for multiple testing, between the herbicide dicamba and rs8192166 in the testosterone metabolizing gene SRD5A1. There was an inverse association between exposure to dicamba and prostate cancer risk among those carrying the homozygous wild-type genotype at a locus in this important hormone metabolism and regulatory gene. In addition, interactions between two organophosphate insecticides and SNPs related to estradiol metabolism were observed to result in an increased risk of prostate cancer.

<h4>Incidence Forecast</h4>
<p>Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are the most commonly occurring malignancy among males between ages 15 and 44 years in the U.S. Although non-Hispanic whites (NHWs) have the highest incidence, rates among Hispanics have increased the most in recent years. Between 1999 and 2012, TGCT incidence rates, both overall and by histology, were highest among NHWs, followed by Hispanics, Asian/Pacific Islanders, and non-Hispanic blacks. Using age-period-cohort models, rates among Hispanics were forecast to increase annually by 3.96% between 2013 and 2026, resulting in the highest rate of increase of any racial/ethnic group. Rates among NHWs will slightly increase, whereas rates among other groups will slightly decrease. (Ghazarian AA, Kelly SP, Altekruse SF, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28241106">Future of testicular germ cell tumor incidence in the United States: Forecast through 2026</a>. <em>Cancer</em> 2017; Epub Feb 27)</p>

<p>Data from two prospective cohort studies (NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study and Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial (PLCO)) were used to evaluate the effects of adiposity over the life course in relation to esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA). Being overweight in early adulthood and weight gain later in life were each associated with increased risks of EA and GCA. This underscores the potential of weight control programs for reducing EA and GCA risk.

<p>During her talk, Dr. Franceschi described opportunities for the prevention of HPV-associated cervical cancer in developing countries. She talked in detail about an example of her work &ndash; an ongoing IARC study in Bhutan where vaccination programs implemented through the schools vastly outperformed the health clinic setting approach.</p>
<p>Dr.&nbsp;Franceschi&rsquo;s visit also included a roundtable discussion with tenure-track investigators to discuss new research projects from around the Division. The fellows later engaged in a lively conversation with her that spanned work on cervical cancer, HPV vaccination and screenings, and her experience with international research collaborations.</p>
<p>Long-term collaborators, friends and former mentees enjoyed the opportunity to reconnect with Dr. Franceschi and brainstorm about new opportunities for collaboration.</p>

<p>Premature death rates have declined in the United States among Hispanics, blacks, and Asian/Pacific Islanders (APIs)&mdash;in line with trends in Canada and the United Kingdom&mdash;but increased among whites and American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs), according to a comprehensive study of premature death rates for the entire U.S. population from 1999 to 2014. This divergence was reported by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and colleagues at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), both part of the National Institutes of Health, and the University of New Mexico College of Nursing. The findings appeared January 25, 2017, in <em>The Lancet</em>.</p>

<p>GIS can be understood as a &ldquo;layering&rdquo; of different types of data, all fundamentally tied to geography, to model real-world phenomena. DCEG scientists collect information on land usage, roads and highways, and many other things to help understand the connections between exposures and cancer.</p>

<p>To determine whether an environmental exposure is a cancer risk factor, researchers must first evaluate who has been exposed, for how long, and at what levels. Typically, retrospective surveys ask participants to recall their residential and occupational history and may also ask about daily activities at home and work, their diet, and lifestyle. However, surveys are limited by the participants&rsquo; knowledge of the exposures in their environment, thus independent exposure assessment using GIS and regulatory and other monitoring data are often used to complement these surveys. One of the main challenges of this endeavor stems from the spatial variation observed in many environmental exposures. GIS technology provides a toolkit for characterizing this complexity and linking it to participants in epidemiologic studies.&nbsp;Early epidemiologic studies were often limited to evaluating relationships based on large geographic areas such as state, county, or zip code, which could result in inaccurate associations between exposures and disease.</p>
<p>One example of the degree to which environmental exposures can vary within geographic areas is concentrations of outdoor air pollutants. Some of these pollutants, like ultrafine particulate matter (UFP) emitted from vehicle exhaust, are hypothesized to increase risk for lung cancer and other diseases. However, UFP concentrations, very high at&nbsp;an emission source, such as on freeways and other major roads, drop off dramatically at short distances downwind from these sources. As a result, an individual whose home is adjacent and downwind of a major road is likely to have a considerably different exposure to UFP than a close neighbor living upwind of the source.

<h3>Advances in Exposure Assessment</h3>
<p>In recent years, as developments in technology and data resources have dramatically improved GIS science, DCEG investigators and others in the field have employed these tools in epidemiologic studies of cancer. Over the past 25+ years,&nbsp;the increasing availability of electronic databases with accurate geolocations of historical air and water monitoring data, satellite imagery, and other geographic datasets (e.g., locations of industrial facilities that emit dioxins, pesticide application registries) allows scientists to reconstruct residential exposures over a substantial portion of a person&rsquo;s lifetime. These long-term exposure data are crucial to the study of cancer, which can take decades to develop. It is especially important to be accurate in estimating exposures suspected to have small individual contributions to risk. When an address history is obtained, investigators can use these tools and databases to characterize exposures across multiple residential addresses. Furthermore, with the availability of global positioning systems (GPS) and commercial address databases such as LexisNexis&reg;, studies are increasingly taking advantage of access to these data.</p>

<p>In one of the first studies to utilize modern GIS methods, the NCI-SEER Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Study in the late 1990&rsquo;s, interviewers took a GPS reading of the home location at the time of the interview and collected lifetime residential histories. The residences were located on crop maps derived from satellite imagery, and acreage of crops around the homes was evaluated as a predictor of pesticide concentrations in dust samples obtained from homes of a subset of the study participants. Increasing acres of corn and soybeans within 750 meters of homes were associated with higher concentrations of agricultural herbicides in house dust samples, regardless of whether the occupants were farmers.&nbsp;Similar methods were used in a subsequent <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303596" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="6507475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303596" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475">study of childhood leukemia in California</a>, in which home locations were linked to a geographic database of agricultural pesticide use.&nbsp;For five of the seven pesticides evaluated, increasing agricultural pesticide use within 1,250 meters in the previous year was associated with significantly higher pesticide concentrations than homes with little or no pesticide use nearby.&nbsp;These approaches to relating geo-referenced crop and pesticide use data with measured residential pesticide concentrations demonstrate how GIS tools can be used to assess participant exposures without the time and cost involved in sampling tens of thousands of homes.</p>

<p>An investigation of drinking water nitrate exposure and cancer risk is underway within the Agricultural Health Study (AHS) cohort, an effort led by Dr. Ward. Participants provided their home addresses and drinking water source at the enrollment interview in the mid 1990&rsquo;s.&nbsp;Over 60% of the cohort used private wells as their water source, which in agricultural areas can have higher nitrate concentrations than public water supplies due to their proximity to nitrogen sources and shallower depth.&nbsp;Because private wells are not routinely monitored, the investigators developed a geospatial model that linked wells with measurement data to historical crop maps, the locations of animal feeding operations, nitrogen fertilizer use, geology, soils, and other factors. &ldquo;We use these techniques to predict exposures in locations where measurements are not available, or where it would be too expensive collect samples,&rdquo; said Dr. Ward. &ldquo;GIS-based modeling, in this case random forest modeling, can provide an estimate of likely contaminants, such as nitrates, in their wells without direct testing of the water.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the New England Bladder Cancer Study, a similar modeling approach was used to estimate arsenic concentrations when it was not possible to obtain water samples from participants&rsquo; current or past homes. Geological data on the bedrock features of the region, which are known to contain natural arsenic, together with information on well depth and other factors associated with arsenic in the groundwater, were used to develop a GIS-based model in the landmark study, which found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27140955">arsenic in drinking water may be responsible for the long-standing bladder cancer excess in the region</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;<br />DCEG scientists are part of a broad community working on developing and applying GIS techniques to cancer research.

<p>Perhaps one of the greatest success stories in cancer prevention is cervical cancer screening. Generations of women, particularly in high-income countries, have benefited from cytology-based annual testing, also known as Pap tests. In the last 10 years, screening guidelines have shifted to include testing for human papillomavirus (HPV), the cause of cervical cancer.</p>
<p>In February 2017, DCEG experts and colleagues from around the world presented the evidence in favor of phasing out cytology-based screening in favor of the more sensitive HPV testing.

<p>In February 2017, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/amundadottir-laufey">Laufey Amundadottir, Ph.D.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH, and promoted to senior investigator in the Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG). Dr. Amundadottir investigates inherited genetic risk factors that contribute to the etiology of pancreatic cancer and survival for patients with the malignancy. She employs multiple approaches to conduct this research, including genome-wide association studies (GWAS) to identify common inherited factors associated with risk, laboratory investigations of susceptibility alleles to identify the biological underpinnings that drive risk, and studies to investigate the interaction of genetic and epidemiological factors on both risk and survival.</p>
<p>Dr. Amundadottir is co-leader for the international Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan), organized within the NCI Cohort Consortium, which brings together multiple, high-quality prospective studies to conduct multi-stage GWAS of pancreatic cancer. Together, the PanScan investigators have discovered fourteen common susceptibility loci. The next phase of PanScan is underway, along with efforts to identify less common and rare variants.</p>
<p>Dr. Amundadottir is following up on findings from PanScan with fine-mapping, functional analyses, and studies of gene expression in regions adjacent to the risk variants, as well as investigations of the transcriptome and epigenome in normal and tumor derived pancreatic tissue samples.</p>
<p>Dr. Amundadottir serves on the NCI Pancreatic Cancer Interest Group and is the LTG liaison to the DCEG Technology Transfer Committee. She also reviews manuscripts for multiple journals and scientific book publishers.</p>

<p>February 11, 2017, marks the Second Annual United Nations International Day of Women and Girls in Science. DCEG strives to support women in science and medicine every day of the year, particularly through the DCEG Office of Education, led by Chief <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/lavigne-jackie">Jackie Lavigne, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a> Every year dozens of women join the Division as postbac, doctoral, and postdoctoral fellows. Each summer the halls are filled with young scientists who spend nine weeks working side-by-side with the leading experts in cancer epidemiology, biostatistics, genetics, and genomics.</p>
<p>Around the country and around the globe, women who trained with DCEG are leading departments of epidemiology, mentoring young women and men, and adding to the evidence base that deepens our understanding of the causes of cancer and the means of its prevention.</p>
<p>DCEG also enthusiastically contributes to broader efforts to support women in science. The Women Scientist Advisors participate in NIH-wide initiatives and design specific programming to represent the interests of women&nbsp;scientists at the NIH.</p>

<p>In recent years, DCEG scientists have made surprising observations that a substantial number of adults&mdash;individuals who did not have cancer at the time their DNA was scanned&mdash;have large structural chromosomal abnormalities, known as mosaicism. In addition, they found that the number of abnormalities an individual may carry appear to increase as they age. Some proportion may be related to environmental exposures, including smoking. These unexpected findings are exciting for a number of reasons; they could lead to new insights on how and why the risk of cancer increases with age, and they might eventually help identify people at higher-than-average risk of developing certain cancers.</p>
<p>When investigators began observing chromosomal mosaicism during quality control checks of data from scores of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), they initially thought the anomalies were due to technical artifacts from the genotyping platform, or the result of poor sample quality. Strangely, DNA from cells assumed to be normal appeared to contain structural aberrations, but they only occurred in a subset of cells from given individuals.</p>
<p>At first, little attention was given to these supposed errors. The abnormalities seemed to be rare and were not considered important to the primary analyses. But over time, a pattern emerged; the abnormalities were found consistently at a low frequency. <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=29&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349630" sys_relationshipid="6620697">Stephen J. Chanock, M.D.</a>, DCEG Director, and colleagues believed they had stumbled upon something unexpected in the samples: detectable genetic mosaicism in apparently normally functioning cells.</p>
<p>Genetic mosaicism is the presence of DNA alterations in only some of the body's cells. A person with mosaicism has a mixture of normal and mosaic DNA in the same type of cells (most of the samples tested in GWAS came from blood or cheek cells). Like a mosaic piece of art, mosaicism in humans is varied and complex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosaicism is a somatic event, meaning a mutation occurs sometime in life after fertilization.

<p>&ldquo;We define mosaicism quite broadly; it can be limited to a one base pair change in your genome different from what you inherited. Or, it can be as large as an entire chromosome that is lost or duplicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mosaicism has been recognized clinically for decades and has been established as a cause of miscarriage, birth defects, developmental delay, and cancer. &ldquo;The really interesting thing about mosaicism is that it can manifest in a lot of different phenotypes,&rdquo; said Dr. Machiela. &ldquo;It can be harmful or benign; it really depends where in the genome it happens and how many of the cells are affected, and possibly when in life it occurs. There are still many unanswered questions.&rdquo; Fortunately, the recent development of more sensitive tools has allowed researchers to study this phenomenon like never before.<br />&nbsp;<br />After their realization, NCI scientists, including Dr. Chanock, <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=966087" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="966087" sys_relationshipid="6620699">Michael Dean, Ph.D.</a>, Chief of the Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Meredith Yeager, Ph.D., Weiyin Zhou, M.S.,&nbsp;and many others, set out to document the frequency these structural abnormalities occur in the general population. They looked for signs of large (greater than 2 million DNA base pairs) mosaic abnormalities in more than 31,000 case subjects with cancer and 26,000 control subjects without cancer from 13 existing studies. At the same time, researchers with the NIH-funded Gene Environment Association Studies (GENEVA) consortium looked for chromosome abnormalities larger than 50,000 base pairs in about 50,000 individuals from 12 studies.</p>
<p>In 2012, the groups published two papers showing mosaicism can be detected in a small fraction of people without a prior history of cancer (Jacobs, 2012), (Laurie, 2012). These alterations appear to increase with age, especially after age 50, and may be associated with an increased risk for cancer, in particular hematologic (blood) cancers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These studies provide evidence from large population-based studies that genetic mosaicism increases with age and could be a risk factor for cancer. This last point raises an important issue with respect to the stability of a person&rsquo;s genome and suggests that detection of genetic mosaicism could be an early marker for detecting cancer, or perhaps other chronic diseases of aging,&rdquo; said Dr. Chanock.</p>
<p>Additional research by Dr. Machiela and collaborators has demonstrated that somatic mosaic chromosomal alterations in the autosomes (any chromosome other than X and Y) are associated with aging and occur at frequencies in excess of 2% from study participants over 80 years of age (Machiela, 2015).</p>
<p>Studies have been extended to examine the sex chromosomes (XX in females and XY in males). For the X chromosome, investigators found that rates of mosaicism are four times higher than in the autosomes (occurring in 0.25% of women), are also associated with aging, and occur most often on the inactivated X chromosome (Machiela, 2016).</p>
<p>For more than 50 years, from the earliest cytogenetic analyses, it has been noted that a fraction of healthy men lose all or some portion of the Y chromosome over the course of their lifetime. However, the phenotypic consequences of mosaic Y loss have not been clear; most scientists considered it a neutral event, related to normal aging. More recently, limited evidence suggests that mosaic Y loss in blood may be associated with risk of some solid tumors and Alzheimer Disease.</p>
<p>Analyses by DCEG investigators have demonstrated that mosaic Y loss is relatively frequent, occurring in 7% of men (Zhou, 2016). &ldquo;Mosaic Y loss is the most common large-scale detectable mosaic chromosomal event in males,&rdquo; said Dr. Machiela. &ldquo;That means we can study it a little better, compared to other mosaic events. In future studies, we hope to definitively establish whether Y chromosome mosaicism is an informative early indicator of cancer risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Investigators also seek to clarify our understanding of the relationship between environmental and genetic exposures and mosaicism. They determined that smoking is an important risk factor for mosaic Y loss; men who smoke are more than three times as likely as nonsmokers to show loss of the Y chromosome in their blood cells, but the association is attenuated with years after cessation. In a genome-wide association study, investigators observed the first example of a common susceptibility locus for genetic mosaicism, specifically mosaic Y loss, on chromosome 14.</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: left; width: 50%; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;">
<p>&ldquo;Mosaicism has great potential to be used as an informative genetic intermediate between normal and disease states.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Scientists believe this research may have future clinical significance. &ldquo;We are still establishing where mosaicism occurs in the genome and how common it is in the population,&rdquo; said Dr. Machiela. &ldquo;These are the very early stages of trying to make links between diseases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The use of SNP microarrays and next generation sequencing platforms has yielded new opportunities to investigate whether mosaicism in blood could serve as an effective biomarker for chronic diseases associated with aging (such as cancer, diabetes or neurodegenerative disorders). Plans are underway to see if chromosome abnormalities in other tissue types could be an early predictor of cancer. Investigators also hope to examine the relationship between telomere length and mosaicism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosaicism has great potential to be used as an informative genetic intermediate between normal and disease states,&rdquo; said Dr. Chanock. &ldquo;However, much remains to be understood before mosaicism can be effectively used as a biomarker for early detection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The latest results from a prospective cohort study of U.S. physicians who performed fluoroscopy-guided interventional procedures (FGI MDs) found no increased risk of death (total and cause-specific), compared to physicians who did not perform these types of tests (psychiatrists), according to a new study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). The results of the study were reported online February 23, 2016, in <em>Radiology</em>.</p>
<p>Fluoroscopy-guided interventional (FGI) procedures are often an alternative to more invasive surgeries, resulting in both clinical benefits and lower cost to patients. The use of these procedures has surged since their introduction in the 1960s. Some concerns have been raised regarding the potential for occupational exposure to ionizing radiation from repeated administering of these procedures.</p>
<p>Epidemiologists at the NCI compared risk of death among 45,634 physicians who perform these procedures and 64,401 psychiatrists. The team chose psychiatrists as a comparison group because they are a class of physicians unlikely to have any occupational exposure to fluoroscopy. During the follow-up period (1979-2008), researchers found that doctors who performed these procedures had lower death rates than psychiatrists for all-cause and many specific causes of death. This disparity increased with later year of medical school graduation. A notable exception was an almost 4-fold increased risk of leukemia, which has previously been associated with radiation exposure, among male FGI MDs who graduated from medical school before 1940, but this was based on a small number of physicians.</p>

<p>In the first-ever large genome-wide association study (GWAS) of gallbladder cancer, researchers have identified common genetic changes associated with elevated risk of the often fatal malignancy. Investigators from the National Cancer Institute, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (NCI/DCEG) collaborated with colleagues at the Centre for Cancer Epidemiology and the Tata Memorial Centre, Mumbai, India, to perform this analysis, which was published March 5th in <em>The Lancet Oncology</em>.</p>
<p>The global prevalence of gallbladder cancer varies widely; certain geographic regions of India have particularly elevated rates, which makes it a prime location for such a study. Prior epidemiological studies have identified few risk factors other than history of gallstones; investigation of genetic factors has been limited. This study is the first large-scale effort to identify common single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), individual base-pair changes in DNA, that may increase an individual&rsquo;s risk. The initial GWAS included over 1000 gallbladder cancer cases and 1700 controls, followed by a replication study set of roughly 430 cases and 420 controls.</p>
<p>Researchers found associations between higher gallbladder cancer risk and several SNPs in the gene region harboring the <em>ABCB4</em> and <em>ABCB1</em> genes,&nbsp;which are responsible for making proteins that help move a certain class of lipids from the liver to the gallbladder, suggesting a possible role for disruption of transport protein function in gallbladder cancer etiology. The authors indicate that future studies are needed to explore the complexity and mechanics of these relationships and to identify more risk-associated SNPs.</p>
<p>The study was co-led by Preetha Rajaraman, Ph.D., NCI Center for Global Health, and DCEG special volunteer, and Rajesh Dikshit, Ph.D., of the Tata Memorial Centre.

<p>In March 2017, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/berndt-sonja">Sonja Berndt, Pharm.D., Ph.D.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH and promoted to senior investigator in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB). Dr. Berndt&rsquo;s research focuses on the genetic and molecular etiology of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and prostate cancer, as well as anthropometric traits that are known risk factors for cancer. She employs sophisticated and novel statistical methods to integrate knowledge from different disciplines to reveal the underlying risk factors for cancer.</p>
<p>As co-principal investigator of a large multicenter genome-wide association study (GWAS) of NHL, Dr. Berndt and her colleagues discovered 27 independent loci associated with specific subtypes of NHL. She initiated a major expansion of the GWAS, doubling the number of cases from an earlier effort, making it possible to identify more risk loci, particularly in association with rarer subtypes.</p>
<p>In her work with several international consortia, Dr. Berndt and collaborators identified several genetic loci associated with prostate cancer risk. She is utilizing new genotyping technology to identify additional novel loci and to conduct fine-mapping analyses to identify variants for follow-up functional studies.</p>
<p>Dr. Berndt has been a leader of multiple genome-wide meta-analyses identifying hundreds of genetic variants associated with obesity, height, and other traits. These studies have made a substantial contribution to our understanding of the heritability and underlying genetic architecture of these phenotypes and how these traits influence cancer risk, initiation, progression, and survival.</p>

<p><a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/bin-zhu">Bin Zhu, Ph.D.</a>, a tenure-track investigator in the Biostatistics Branch, seeks to puzzle out how the vast constellation of germline risk variants, individually or in combination, affect the number and type of somatic mutations in the resulting tumor. His work to understand the relationship between the &ldquo;two genomes&rdquo; has depended upon the convergence of robust analytic techniques and availability of samples and detailed treatment and survival data from tumor banks, which have catalyzed him to develop methods to integrate these resources. Ultimately, he hopes this work will lead to meaningful improvements to understanding cancer etiology, and estimating patient survival and prognosis.</p>
<p>In September 2016, Dr. Zhu and DCEG colleagues reported on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27467053">relationship between germline and point somatic mutations in more than 600 breast cancer cases</a>. The team examined data from paired tumor and non-cancerous lymphocyte samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas. They found an inverse association between the genetic risk score for cancer, as determined by which germline risk variants (single nucleotide polymorphisms or SNPs) a woman carried, and the number of somatic mutations in the tumor&mdash;the higher her risk, the fewer somatic mutations in her tumor tissue. There was an especially strong inverse association between a particular SNP in the DNA repair gene <em>RAD51B</em> and number of somatic mutations. This finding presents an exciting opportunity to explore the molecular pathways that relate this mutation to cancer initiation and progression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We would like to understand how tumors initiate and progress through somatic mutations in the context of germline variants and environmental factors,&rdquo; said Dr. Zhu. He and his collaborators are conducting similar studies on a wide variety of cancer types, as well as investigations into how particular germline SNPs cause specific somatic mutation patterns.</p>
<p>The team is also exploring the influence of other &ldquo;-omics&rdquo; features on survival. Clinical information from cancer registries, such as age, race, and cancer type, is traditionally used to estimate patient survival, but preliminary results from Dr. Zhu&rsquo;s project indicate that multiple layers of &ldquo;-omics&rdquo; data for each patient can improve the accuracy of such prognoses. Leveraging the capacity of DCEG to gather detailed data on the genome (DNA), epigenome (chemicals that regulate gene expression), and transcriptome (RNA), he and others are creating a framework for combining molecular data with clinical data. The plan takes into account the accumulated effects of many small molecular features that can influence survival.</p>
<p>Dr. Zhu&rsquo;s research represents part of the underpinnings of the personalized medicine movement, a technology-driven shift towards using increasingly specific patient characteristics to influence diagnosis and treatment. Learning how particular mutations interact with each other and how those mutations can predict survival are important steps towards improving cancer care.</p>

<p>In recent years, DCEG scientists have made surprising observations that a substantial number of adults&mdash;individuals who did not have cancer at the time their DNA was scanned&mdash;have large structural chromosomal abnormalities, known as mosaicism. In addition, they found that the number of abnormalities an individual may carry appear to increase as they age. Some proportion may be related to environmental exposures, including smoking. These unexpected findings are exciting for a number of reasons; they could lead to new insights on how and why the risk of cancer increases with age, and they might eventually help identify people at higher-than-average risk of developing certain cancers.</p>
<p>When investigators began observing chromosomal mosaicism during quality control checks of data from scores of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), they initially thought the anomalies were due to technical artifacts from the genotyping platform, or the result of poor sample quality. Strangely, DNA from cells assumed to be normal appeared to contain structural aberrations, but they only occurred in a subset of cells from given individuals.</p>
<p>At first, little attention was given to these supposed errors. The abnormalities seemed to be rare and were not considered important to the primary analyses. But over time, a pattern emerged; the abnormalities were found consistently at a low frequency. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=38&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" sys_contentid="349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349630" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7278024">Stephen J. Chanock, M.D.</a>, DCEG Director, and colleagues believed they had stumbled upon something unexpected in the samples: detectable genetic mosaicism in apparently normally functioning cells.</p>
<p>Genetic mosaicism is the presence of DNA alterations in only some of the body's cells. A person with mosaicism has a mixture of normal and mosaic DNA in the same type of cells (most of the samples tested in GWAS came from blood or cheek cells). Like a mosaic piece of art, mosaicism in humans is varied and complex.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosaicism is a somatic event, meaning a mutation occurs sometime in life after fertilization.

<p>&ldquo;We define mosaicism quite broadly; it can be limited to a one base pair change in your genome different from what you inherited. Or, it can be as large as an entire chromosome that is lost or duplicated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mosaicism has been recognized clinically for decades and has been established as a cause of miscarriage, birth defects, developmental delay, and cancer. &ldquo;The really interesting thing about mosaicism is that it can manifest in a lot of different phenotypes,&rdquo; said Dr. Machiela. &ldquo;It can be harmful or benign; it really depends where in the genome it happens and how many of the cells are affected, and possibly when in life it occurs. There are still many unanswered questions.&rdquo; Fortunately, the recent development of more sensitive tools has allowed researchers to study this phenomenon like never before.<br />&nbsp;<br />After their realization, NCI scientists, including Dr. Chanock, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=17&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=966087" sys_contentid="966087" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="966087" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7278026">Michael Dean, Ph.D.</a>, Chief of the Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Meredith Yeager, Ph.D., Weiyin Zhou, M.S.,&nbsp;and many others, set out to document the frequency these structural abnormalities occur in the general population. They looked for signs of large (greater than 2 million DNA base pairs) mosaic abnormalities in more than 31,000 case subjects with cancer and 26,000 control subjects without cancer from 13 existing studies. At the same time, researchers with the NIH-funded Gene Environment Association Studies (GENEVA) consortium looked for chromosome abnormalities larger than 50,000 base pairs in about 50,000 individuals from 12 studies.</p>
<p>In 2012, the groups published two papers showing mosaicism can be detected in a small fraction of people without a prior history of cancer (Jacobs, 2012), (Laurie, 2012). These alterations appear to increase with age, especially after age 50, and may be associated with an increased risk for cancer, in particular hematologic (blood) cancers.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These studies provide evidence from large population-based studies that genetic mosaicism increases with age and could be a risk factor for cancer. This last point raises an important issue with respect to the stability of a person&rsquo;s genome and suggests that detection of genetic mosaicism could be an early marker for detecting cancer, or perhaps other chronic diseases of aging,&rdquo; said Dr. Chanock.</p>
<p>Additional research by Dr. Machiela and collaborators has demonstrated that somatic mosaic chromosomal alterations in the autosomes (any chromosome other than X and Y) are associated with aging and occur at frequencies in excess of 2% from study participants over 80 years of age (Machiela, 2015).</p>
<p>Studies have been extended to examine the sex chromosomes (XX in females and XY in males). For the X chromosome, investigators found that rates of mosaicism are four times higher than in the autosomes (occurring in 0.25% of women), are also associated with aging, and occur most often on the inactivated X chromosome (Machiela, 2016).</p>
<p>For more than 50 years, from the earliest cytogenetic analyses, it has been noted that a fraction of healthy men lose all or some portion of the Y chromosome over the course of their lifetime. However, the phenotypic consequences of mosaic Y loss have not been clear; most scientists considered it a neutral event, related to normal aging. More recently, limited evidence suggests that mosaic Y loss in blood may be associated with risk of some solid tumors and Alzheimer Disease.</p>
<p>Analyses by DCEG investigators have demonstrated that mosaic Y loss is relatively frequent, occurring in 7% of men (Zhou, 2016). &ldquo;Mosaic Y loss is the most common large-scale detectable mosaic chromosomal event in males,&rdquo; said Dr. Machiela. &ldquo;That means we can study it a little better, compared to other mosaic events. In future studies, we hope to definitively establish whether Y chromosome mosaicism is an informative early indicator of cancer risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Investigators also seek to clarify our understanding of the relationship between environmental and genetic exposures and mosaicism. They determined that smoking is an important risk factor for mosaic Y loss; men who smoke are more than three times as likely as nonsmokers to show loss of the Y chromosome in their blood cells, but the association is attenuated with years after cessation. In a genome-wide association study, investigators observed the first example of a common susceptibility locus for genetic mosaicism, specifically mosaic Y loss, on chromosome 14.</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: left; width: 50%; margin: 0 10px 5px 0;">
<p>&ldquo;Mosaicism has great potential to be used as an informative genetic intermediate between normal and disease states.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Scientists believe this research may have future clinical significance. &ldquo;We are still establishing where mosaicism occurs in the genome and how common it is in the population,&rdquo; said Dr. Machiela. &ldquo;These are the very early stages of trying to make links between diseases.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The use of SNP microarrays and next generation sequencing platforms has yielded new opportunities to investigate whether mosaicism in blood could serve as an effective biomarker for chronic diseases associated with aging (such as cancer, diabetes or neurodegenerative disorders). Plans are underway to see if chromosome abnormalities in other tissue types could be an early predictor of cancer. Investigators also hope to examine the relationship between telomere length and mosaicism.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosaicism has great potential to be used as an informative genetic intermediate between normal and disease states,&rdquo; said Dr. Chanock. &ldquo;However, much remains to be understood before mosaicism can be effectively used as a biomarker for early detection.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In March 2017, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/friesen-melissa">Melissa Friesen, Ph.D.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH and promoted to senior investigator in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch. Dr. Friesen is an internationally recognized leader in the field of exposure assessment of occupational risk factors in epidemiologic studies.</p>
<p>An ongoing challenge in large-scale epidemiological studies is the collection, processing, and use of occupational exposure data. Dr. Friesen develops exposure assessment methods and tools to facilitate the use of occupational risk factor data in epidemiologic studies by efficiently transforming the verbatim responses of participants on questionnaires into usable data. One such tool is the <a href="http://soccer.nci.nih.gov">SOCcer (Standardized Occupation Coding for Computer-assisted Epidemiological Research</a>) algorithm which automatically codes job descriptions into standardized occupation classification (SOC) codes.</p>
<p>Dr. Friesen&rsquo;s methodologic research and resulting exposure estimates have directly led to the identification and quantification of associations between common workplace exposures and disease. Her work has influenced policy worldwide and informed scientific recommendations to improve worker health.</p>

<p>A new analysis of thyroid cancer trends found significant increases in both incidence and mortality overall and for advanced-stage papillary thyroid cancer (PTC).

<p>Thyroid cancer incidence in the United States has increased more than threefold over the past four decades, mainly driven by increases in PTC, the most common type. &ldquo;Historically, it has been unclear whether this trend represents a true rise in thyroid cancer cases, or if some or all of the increase could be explained by overdiagnosis of small, low-risk thyroid tumors discovered incidentally due to the introduction and increased use of sensitive imaging procedures and diagnostic techniques,&rdquo; said lead author and DCEG investigator <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=939428" sys_contentid="939428" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="939428" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276295">Cari Kitahara, Ph.D.</a></p>
<p>This study is the first in-depth analysis of thyroid cancer mortality and incidence rates, and looks specifically at aggressive tumors like advanced-stage PTC. Using data from SEER-9 registries and the National Center for Health Statistics, investigators examined 77,276 cases of thyroid cancer diagnosed in the United States between 1974 and 2013, of whom 2,371 died of thyroid cancer between 1994 and 2013. By combining incidence and mortality data, the researchers created a unique opportunity to evaluate incidence-based thyroid cancer mortality rates according to histology, stage, and tumor size at diagnosis. These methods help to assess what part of the increase may be a real increase, as opposed to an artifact of overdiagnosis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The team found that overall incidence of thyroid cancer increased by an average of 3.6 percent per year, and incidence-based thyroid cancer mortality rates increased by an average of 1.1 percent per year. For advanced-stage PTC, average yearly incidence and mortality rates increased by 2.4 percent and 2.9 percent, respectively.</p>

<p>These results suggest that both overdiagnosis and a real increase in the occurrence of PTC have contributed to the observed trends in thyroid cancer incidence; thyroid cancer is now the 8th most common cancer diagnosis in the United States. The authors highlight the need for future studies to discern the specific environmental or lifestyle factors behind the increase, but also stress that thyroid cancer can be treated very successfully with surgery and radiation, if detected at an early stage.</p>

<p>Cancer affects all population groups in the United States. Some racial and ethnic minorities bear a disproportionate burden of cancer, compared with whites. The DCEG research portfolio includes a broad range of studies designed to identify populations that experience elevated incidence or mortality from cancer and uncover the factors contributing to disparities in risk. Ultimately, this research contributes to the basis for the development of targeted preventive measures in high-risk populations.</p>
<p>Our understanding of the range and complexity of health disparities has evolved as a result of <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/how-we-study/descriptive-epidemiology">descriptive epidemiologic research</a>. Studies of cancer across race, ethnicity, geographic area, urban/rural residence, socioeconomic status, and trends over time have provided important clues to the role of lifestyle, environmental, and genetic factors that affect cancer risk.</p>
<p>DCEG investigators conduct descriptive analysis of cancer rates and trends using population-based registries such as <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/">SEER</a>. Another important tool is the <a href="https://gis.cancer.gov/geoviewer/">NCI Geoviewer</a>, which allows scientists to characterize the geographic distribution of cancer as well as differences by race and ethnicity. In recent years, DCEG biostatisticians have developed more sophisticated statistical methods, such as the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/people-in-the-news/apc-model">Age-Period-Cohort tool</a>, to analyze the complex, interrelated effects of age, time period, and birth cohort on incidence trends within the U.S. population.</p>
<p>Descriptive epidemiological studies provide valuable information for the prevention of disease, design of interventions, and conduct of additional research among minority populations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have worked with Dr. Easton since the formation of the Breast Cancer Association Consortium (BCAC) in 2005. Under his leadership, this consortium has identified the majority of over 170 common susceptibility loci for breast cancer,&rdquo; said Deputy Director <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=8&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1004366" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1004366" sys_relationshipid="7260533" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="1004366">Montserrat Garcia-Closas, M.D., Dr.P.H.</a>, who hosted the visit.</p>
<p>In a division-wide seminar titled &ldquo;Susceptibility to breast cancer, common and rare: How far have we gone and where next?&rdquo;, Dr. Easton outlined the state of the science on heritable factors for this malignancy, and described the major international efforts to identify other genetic variants that may contribute to risk, including large-scale array genotyping systems such as iCOGS and OncoArray.</p>
<p>The scientific community&rsquo;s understanding of heritable breast cancer risk has come a long way in recent years, yet 41% of familial risk is still unexplained. Dr. Easton emphasized that there is much more work to be done to discover which genetic variants are important in determining breast cancer risk, especially with increasing demand for clinical applications of risk estimates.</p>
<p>Dr. Easton described modern strategies for identification of risk loci that he views as particularly promising. Some examples were fine mapping to pinpoint specific single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) independently associated with cancer risk, and growing efforts to sequence the tumors to reveal interactions between somatic and germline mutations in breast cancer etiology.</p>
<p>Using the findings from such studies, Dr. Easton and colleagues calculate individual polygenic risk scores (PRS), an account of all known genetic characteristics that affect breast cancer risk. Compared to other approaches that consider only lifestyle factors or breast density, total PRS is very effective in predicting risk.</p>
<p>During his two-day visit, Dr. Easton participated in several meetings with special interest groups at DCEG. Dr. Garcia-Closas hosted discussions on improving breast cancer risk stratification in the general population and on the status and challenges of genome-wide association studies for other cancers. In addition, DCEG investigators hosted a discussion on tissue composition, somatic alterations, and breast cancer risk and progression, and another on the value of circulating blood biomarkers.</p>
<p>Finally, Dr. Easton attended an informal lunch with fellows, organized by postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=89&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1033198#Mullooly" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033198" sys_relationshipid="7260534" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1033198#mullooly">Maeve Mullooly, Ph.D., M.P.H</a>.

<h3><strong>Tell us about your research on health disparities.</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Davis Lynn:</strong> My current research projects are focused on understanding racial disparities in breast cancer incidence. For one, I am investigating whether DNA methylation profiles in breast milk vary between white and African American women and whether these profiles are associated with known breast cancer risk factors. DNA methylation plays a significant role in breast carcinogenesis, and the analysis of milk during the postpartum period may help us understand mechanisms underlying breast cancer risk factors at a unique time in a woman&rsquo;s reproductive life stage.</p>
<p><strong>Layne:</strong> Currently, my research involves etiologic studies of prostate cancer. I am particularly interested in the interplay between race, vitamin D status, and cancer risk.&nbsp;Black men are an understudied population, especially in terms of prospective research; they are more likely to experience low vitamin D status, and more likely to develop prostate cancer, compared to men of other races or ethnicities. To investigate these relationships, I am evaluating nutrient status as measured by reported dietary intake, blood concentrations, and genetic variation, and race.</p>

<h3><strong>How did you get interested in this field?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Davis Lynn:</strong> As an African American woman, I am aware that there are certain diseases that I am at risk for, not only because of family history, but because race is a risk factor. As a scientist, I want to understand the interaction between the biological and social/environmental factors that make race a risk factor.</p>
<p><strong>Layne:</strong> I developed a passion for and commitment to racial/ethnic cancer health disparities research during my MPH training at Boston University School of Public Health.&nbsp;I first learned of the extensive and pervasive nature of racial/ethnic health disparities in one of my core introductory courses. I subsequently became interested in the race-vitamin D-cancer relationship while looking for a final project for a course in cancer epidemiology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<br />
<h3><strong>Who or what has supported you the most in your career?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Davis Lynn:</strong> Of course, my family. But also, government (NIH and National Science Foundation) funding programs aimed to support underrepresented persons. I have participated in several throughout my undergraduate and graduate career that have helped me to succeed, including the <a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/Training/MARC/Pages/USTARAwards.aspx">NIH Maximizing Access to Research Careers Undergraduate &ndash; Student Training in Academic Research (MARC U-STAR)</a> program and the <a href="http://www.umbc.edu/Programs/Meyerhoff/graduate/">Initiative to Maximize Student Development (IMSD) Meyerhoff Graduate Fellows Program</a>. The staff associated with these programs are committed to the success of their students.</p>
<p><strong>Layne:</strong> I would have to say faith and family have been the most consistent sources of support, and continue to sustain me in my journey.&nbsp;I&rsquo;ve also benefited from tremendous formal and informal mentorship throughout my academic training and now here in DCEG as a postdoctoral fellow.</p>
<h3><strong>What are your goals for the future?</strong></h3>
<p><strong>Davis Lynn:</strong> I&rsquo;d like to lead a cross-disciplinary research team focused on understanding how biology and the environment interact and impact cancer risk and survival.</p>
<p><strong>Layne:</strong> In the short term, my goal is to come up with a cohesive set of research objectives that incorporate my training, and that are responsive to the research needs for addressing health disparities. In line with this, one of my long-term goals as an independent investigator is to build the interdisciplinary network necessary to develop racially and ethnically diverse cohorts to facilitate prospective research of under-studied populations in the future.</p>

<p>In April 2017, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/gierach-gretchen">Gretchen Gierach, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH and promoted to senior investigator in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch. Dr. Gierach has developed an interdisciplinary breast cancer research program with a special emphasis on the epidemiology of breast density, one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Her work employs a range of technologies and approaches to improve the measurement of density, delineate risk factors for elevated density, and understand mechanisms that mediate its relationship to breast cancer risk.</p>
<p>Dr. Gierach is principal investigator of the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/breast-cancer/radiology-evaluation-study-tissues-stamp-project">Breast Radiology Evaluation and Study of Tissues (BREAST) Stamp Project</a>, a complex field effort designed to characterize the radiologic, histologic, and molecular features of dense breast tissue. Most analyses of mammographic breast density (MBD) have employed subjective visual categorizations or computer-assisted quantification of two-dimensional images (area density), which ignore breast thickness. Dr. Gierach incorporated cutting edge methods to measure MBD in three dimensions, as a volume, a novel component of the project.</p>
<p>As a separate yet complementary effort to her MBD research, Dr. Gierach leads several projects to better understand the role of hormones as etiologic factors in breast cancer. Her key work has demonstrated that estrogen metabolite profiles contain important risk information and non-sex hormones, such as insulin-like growth factors (IGFs), may influence molecular markers of risk. She is also evaluating the interrelationships between endogenous hormones, involution of terminal duct lobular units (TDLU), and MBD. TDLUs are milk-secreting structures thought to be the tissue of origin for the majority of breast cancers.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a recent study within Kaiser Permanente Northwest and Colorado, Dr. Gierach and colleagues&nbsp;observed tamoxifen treatment reduces risk of contralateral breast cancer in a general community health care setting, an important confirmation of clinical trial results. They also reported on changes in MBD after initiation of treatment: patients who experienced large reductions in MBD following tamoxifen had an improved prognosis. The finding suggests reduction in MBD as an early indicator of tamoxifen effectiveness and could have value for clinicians and patients when deciding whether to continue tamoxifen therapy or change clinical management.</p>
<p>Dr. Gierach also completed the field effort of the <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/breast-cancer/ultrasound-study-tamoxifen">Ultrasound Study of Tamoxifen</a>, in which she and colleagues used novel ultrasound tomography methods to assess changes in volumetric breast density within the first year of tamoxifen therapy. This technology may provide a safer alternative to mammography for monitoring therapy-induced changes in MBD because it allows repeated measurements without exposing women to ionizing radiation.</p>

<p>A new analysis by researchers from DCEG shows a considerable increase in risk for several cancers following organ transplantation in childhood. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=22&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349601" sys_contentid="349601" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349601" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276288">Eric A. Engels, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, former DCEG fellow Dr. Elizabeth Yanik, and colleagues conducted the study using data from nearly 18,000 pediatric transplant recipients in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303740" sys_contentid="303740" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303740" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7276286">Transplant Cancer Match Study</a>, making this the largest study of cancer in the pediatric transplant population to date.</p>
<p>Transplant recipients must utilize immunosuppressive medications to prevent rejection of the transplanted organ, resulting in weakened immune systems over the life span. The evidence on cancer risk in adult transplant recipients has been well-documented. However, in childhood, the immune system is still in development, and often children have not yet been exposed to some cancer-causing infectious agents. These factors, in addition to the many decades they are expected to live post-transplantation, makes this investigation particularly critical.</p>
<p>Overall cancer incidence among pediatric transplant recipients was over 19 times higher than that of the general pediatric population. The researchers found that the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the most common cancer in this population, was increased 212-fold. NHL risk was especially high during the first year following transplantation, as well as in individuals younger than five years of age and those receiving an intestine transplant. NHL risk was also very high in individuals who did not have antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at the time of transplantation, reflecting the effects of primary EBV infection following transplantation.</p>
<p>Pediatric transplant patients also experience relatively high risks of a number of other cancers, including Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia, and cancers of the liver, soft tissue, ovary, vulva, testis, bladder, kidney, and thyroid.</p>

<p>Given the strongly elevated risk for NHL, these results highlight the potential for substantial reduction in cancer risk among pediatric transplant patients if EBV infection can be prevented or controlled.</p>

<h4>Meat, Heme Iron, Nitrates, and Nitrites</h4>
<p>Using baseline dietary data and 16 years of follow-up data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, the authors observed that increased risks of all-cause mortality and death due to nine different causes were associated with both processed and unprocessed red meat, accounted for, in part, by heme iron and nitrate/nitrite from processed meat. They also observed reduced risks associated with substituting white meat, particularly unprocessed white meat. (Etemadi A, Sinha R, Ward MH, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28487287">Mortality from different causes associated with meat, heme iron, nitrates, and nitrites in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study: Population-based cohort study</a>. <em>BMJ</em> 2017; Epub May 9)</p>

<h4>Genetic Variants among Malaysian Women</h4>
<p>Germline DNA from 467 breast cancer patients in Malaysia was used to characterize the spectrum of germline mutations in <em>BRCA1</em>, <em>BRCA2</em>, and <em>PALB2</em> in population-based breast cancer cases in an Asian population. Investigators found a prevalence of germline mutations of 2.8, 3.23, and 0.86 percent for <em>BRCA1</em>, <em>BRCA2</em>, and <em>PALB2</em>, respectively. Compared to mutation non-carriers, <em>BRCA1</em> mutation carriers were more likely to have an earlier age at onset, triple-negative subtype, and lower body mass index, whereas <em>BRCA2</em> mutation carriers were more likely to have a positive family history. Nineteen variants of unknown significance were also identified, with some predicted to alter splicing or transcription factor binding sites. (Yang XR, Devi BCR, Sung H, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28664506">Prevalence and spectrum of germline rare variants in BRCA1/2 and PALB2 among breast cancer cases in Sarawak, Malaysia</a>. <em>Breast Cancer Res Treat 2017</em>; Epub Jun 29)</p>
<h4>Risk Factors for <em>In Situ</em> and Invasive Breast Cancer</h4>
<p>Data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study showed younger age at menopause associated with increased risk of incident ductal carcinoma <em>in situ</em> (DCIS) but reduced risks of lobular carcinoma <em>in situ</em> (LCIS) and invasive ductal carcinomas. Prior breast biopsy was more strongly associated with risk of LCIS than DCIS. Increased risks associated with menopausal hormone therapy were stronger for LCIS than DCIS or invasive lobular carcinomas. Associations were similar for race, ages at menarche or first birth, family history, alcohol consumption and smoking, suggesting that most risk factor associations are similar for <em>in situ </em>and invasive cancers, and may influence early stages of tumorigenesis. (Mullooly M, Khodr ZG, Dallal CM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28637226">Epidemiologic risk factors for <em>in situ</em> and invasive breast cancer among postmenopausal women in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study</a>. <em>Am J Epidemiol </em>2017; Epub Jun 16)</p>
<h4>Metabolomics</h4>
<p>Investigators examined prediagnostic serum concentrations of diet-related metabolites in a nested case-control study of 621 postmenopausal invasive breast cancer cases and 621 matched controls in the multicenter PLCO cohort. Of 113 diet-related metabolites, 3 were associated with overall breast cancer risk: caprate, a saturated fatty acid; &gamma;-carboxyethyl hydrochroman (&gamma;-CEHC), a vitamin E (&gamma;-tocopherol) derivative; and 4-androsten-3&beta;,17&beta;-diol-monosulfate (1), an androgen. Nineteen metabolites were significantly associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-positive (ER(+)) breast cancer (418 cases): 12 alcohol-associated metabolites, including 7 androgens and &alpha;-hydroxyisovalerate; 3 vitamin E (tocopherol) derivatives; and fried food-associated 2-hydroxyoctanoate. No metabolites were significantly associated with ER-negative breast cancer (144 cases).

<h4>Host DNA Methylation Markers</h4>
<p>A tissue-based biomarker discovery effort identified host DNA methylation markers associated with cervical cancer and precancer. The findings were validated in liquid-based cytology samples using two different high-resolution DNA-methylation detection methods. Of 15 candidate gene markers, 10 had an area under the curve (AUC) of &ge; 0.75 for discrimination of high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or worse (HSIL+) from &lt;HSIL cytology using at least one assay. Overall, <em>SOX1</em>, <em>DCC</em>, and <em>EPB41L3</em> showed the best discrimination with AUC values of &ge;0.80, irrespective of methylation detection assay. In addition to verifying candidate DNA methylation markers, several novel candidate markers for detection of cervical precancer in cytology specimens were identified that warrant further validation in prospective studies.

<h4>Aflatoxin</h4>
<p>Aflatoxin, which causes hepatocellular carcinoma, may also cause gallbladder cancer. The investigators analyzed a marker of aflatoxin exposure in 209 gallbladder cancer patients and 250 controls with gallstones but no sign of cancer. The marker, the aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-lysine molecule, was detected in plasma samples from 32 percent of cases and 15 percent of controls. Among individuals with detectable AFB1-lysine, individuals with levels in the highest 25 percent of the population were over seven times more likely to have gallbladder cancer, compared to those in the lowest 25 percent.

<h4>Body Size Indicators</h4>
<p>Analyses based on individual-level data from nearly 2 million participants in 19 prospective cohort studies showed higher adult body mass index (BMI), young-adult BMI, adult weight gain, height, waist circumference, waist-height ratio, and hip circumference, but not waist-hip ratio, were associated with higher risks of gallbladder cancer. Results did not differ meaningfully by sex or other demographic/lifestyle factors. Measures of overall and central excess body weight are associated with higher gallbladder cancer risks.

<h4>Diet</h4>
<p>Data from a case-control study of biliary tract cancer in Shanghai, China, were used to examine the effects of shifts to a more Western diet. The allium food group, consisting of onions, garlic, and shallots, and the food group containing seaweed and kelp, were inversely associated with gallbladder cancer. In contrast, both preserved vegetables and salted meats food groups showed positive associations with gallbladder cancer. Each of these four food groups showed similar trends for extrahepatic bile duct and ampulla of Vater cancers. The analysis suggests that intake of foods with greater anti-inflammatory properties may play a role in decreasing the risk of biliary tract cancers.

<h4>Germline Susceptibility</h4>
<p>A genome-wide scan of gallbladder cancer cases and hospital visitor controls, both of Indian descent, followed by imputation across the genome, identified genome-wide significant associations for several markers in the chromosomal region 7q21.12 harboring both the <em>ABCB1</em> and <em>ABCB4</em> genes, with the most notable SNPs after replication and meta-analysis being rs1558375, rs17209837, and rs4148808. These findings, along with <em>in-silico</em> and biological evidence indicating the potential functional significance of <em>ABCB1</em> and <em>ABCB4</em>, underlines the likely importance of these hepatobiliary phospholipid transporter genes in the pathology of gallbladder cancer.

<h4>Functional Characterization of a Multi-cancer Risk Locus on Chr5p15.33</h4>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have mapped multiple independent cancer susceptibility loci to chr5p15.33. Investigators have uncovered a likely causal variant in the <em>TERT-CLPTM1L</em> Region 2 susceptibility locus and identified ZNF148 as a potential effector of a gene-regulatory element that mediates increased <em>TERT</em> expression in an allele-specific manner. Fine-mapping results highlight the complexity of this region and indicate that Region 2 may, in some cancers, consist of more than one underlying functional signal. The results are remarkably consistent in eight cell lines across four different cancer types and explain, at least in part, the biological underpinnings of risk for rs36115365. The data suggest that the mechanism by which ZNF148 influences <em>TERT</em> is similar for cancer types in which the C-allele of rs36115365 contributes to increased risk, or alternatively to disease protection. (Fang J, Jia J, Makowski M, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28447668">Functional characterization of a multi-cancer risk locus on chr5p15.33 reveals regulation of <em>TERT</em> by ZNF148</a>. <em>Nat Commun</em> 2017; Epub May 2).

<h3>Liver</h3>
<h4>Adiposity Throughout Adult Life</h4>
<p>Obesity relatively late in adulthood has been consistently associated with increased risk of primary liver cancer. However, little is known about the role of early adult adiposity and evolution of adiposity across adulthood in hepatocarcinogenesis. Investigators evaluated weight at ages 18, 35, 50, and at study baseline in relation to subsequent development of liver cancer.&nbsp; Being obese (BMI &ge; 30) at ages 18, 35, 50 and at baseline (mean age 62.3 years, range 50.3-71.5 years) was associated with an 86 percent to 119 percent elevated risk of HCC. BMI trajectories that resulted in obesity were associated with &sim;80 percent higher HCC incidence. BMI at age 18, per 5 kg/m(2), was associated with a 34 percent&nbsp; higher risk of ICC, but the association attenuated for BMI at older ages. The findings suggest that maintaining a healthy BMI throughout the lifetime may reduce liver cancer risk. (Yang B, Petrick JL, Kelly SP, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28411388">Adiposity across the adult life course and incidence of primary liver cancer: The NIH-AARP cohort</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2017; Epub April 26)</p>
<h4>Tooth Loss and Liver Cancer</h4>
<p>The association between tooth loss and primary liver cancer incidence was examined in a prospective cohort of Finnish male smokers (n = 29,096). Among the 213 incident primary liver cancer cases that occurred over 17 years of follow-up, having 11-31 permanent teeth lost or all 32 teeth lost was each associated with higher risk of liver cancer, compared to those having 0-10 teeth lost. Adjusting for <em>Helicobactor pylori</em> seropositivity yielded a small attenuation of the effect estimate.

<h4>Gene-set Analysis</h4>
<p>Gene-set analysis (GSA) is an approach using the results of single-marker genome-wide association studies when investigating pathways with respect to the genetic basis of a disease. Investigators applied the META-GSA method to data from the lung cancer TRICL/ILCCO consortium, studying 234 pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. The systemic lupus erythematosus KEGG pathway hsa05322, driven by the gene region 6p21-22, was implicated in lung cancer. This gene region is known to be associated with squamous cell lung carcinoma. The most important genes driving the significance of this pathway belong to the genomic areas <em>HIST1-H4L</em>, <em>-1BN</em>, <em>-2BN</em>, <em>-H2AK</em>, <em>-H4K</em> and <em>C2/C4A/C4B</em>. Within these areas, the markers most significantly associated with LC are rs13194781 (located within <em>HIST12BN</em>) and rs1270942 (located between <em>C2</em> and <em>C4A</em>). (Rosenberger A, Sohns M, Friedrichs S, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28273134">Gene-set meta-analysis of lung cancer identifies pathway related to systemic lupus erythematosus</a>. <em>PLoS One</em> 2017)</p>
<h4>Genetic Susceptibility Across Histologic Subtypes</h4>
<p>An analysis of new and existing genome-wide association study data on 29,266 lung cancer cases and 56,450 controls identified 18 susceptibility loci achieving genome-wide significance, including 10 new loci. The new loci highlight the striking heterogeneity in genetic susceptibility across the histological subtypes of lung cancer, with four associated with lung cancer overall and six associated with lung adenocarcinoma. Gene expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analysis in 1,425 normal lung tissue samples highlights <em>RNASET2</em>, <em>SECISBP2L,</em> and <em>NRG1</em> as candidate genes. Other loci include genes such as a cholinergic nicotinic receptor, <em>CHRNA2</em>, and the telomere-related genes <em>OFBC1</em> and <em>RTEL1</em>.

<h4>Adolescent and Midlife Diet</h4>
<p>Data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study show that carbohydrate intake during adolescence and calcium intake ten years before baseline were associated with a significant reduction in risk of pancreatic cancer, while total fat intake at both times and intake of butter and margarine in midlife were associated with significantly increased risk. There also appeared to be differences in risk when intakes at both time points were considered together. These results suggest that intake of dietary nutrients and food groups over the life course, rather than at one specific point in time, may play an important role in the etiology of pancreatic cancer.

<h4>Functional Regulatory Variants</h4>
<p>Investigators conducted an in-depth study of the impact of inherited genetic variants on the pancreatic transcriptome. By correlating genotypes with gene expression, close to 40,000 <em>cis</em>-e expression quantitative trait loci (QTLs) in histologically normal and tumor-derived pancreatic tissue samples were identified, corresponding to 484 and 237 eGenes, respectively. Forty-two percent of eGenes were specific for the normal-derived pancreatic tissue samples and 23 percent for pancreatic tumors. eQTLs were enriched close to transcriptional start sites and in non-coding functional elements important for pancreatic exocrine tissues, as well as highly shared with the endocrine pancreas. A large number of eQTLs were shared between normal and tumor-derived pancreatic tissue samples; these eQTLs had stronger effect sizes and were located closer to transcriptional start sites than non-shared eQTLs. Pancreatic cancer risk alleles on chr9q34.2 were strongly associated with <em>ABO</em> gene expression; this effect may be due to allele-specific effects of the risk variants on a non-coding gene regulatory element.

<h3><a id="Pediatric-Cancers"></a>Pediatric Cancers</h3>
<h4>Pediatric Solid Organ Transplantation</h4>
<p>Using data from nearly 18,000 pediatric transplant recipients, the Transplant Cancer Match Study found that the overall cancer incidence among pediatric transplant recipients was over 19 times higher than that of the general pediatric population. The risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), the most common cancer among this population, was increased 212-fold, and was especially high during the first year following transplantation, as well as in individuals younger than five years of age and those receiving an intestine transplant. NHL risk was also very high in individuals who did not have antibodies to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) at the time of transplantation, reflecting the effects of primary EBV infection following transplantation. Pediatric transplant patients also experience relatively high risks of a number of other cancers, including Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, leukemia, and cancers of the liver, soft tissue, ovary, vulva, testis, bladder, kidney, and thyroid. Given the strongly elevated risk for NHL, these results highlight the potential for substantial reduction in cancer risk among pediatric transplant patients if EBV infection can be prevented or controlled.

<h4><em>TMPRSS2</em>-<em>ERG</em> Gene Fusions and Race</h4>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was used to assess <em>ERG</em> expression as the established surrogate of <em>ERG</em> fusion genes among 262 prostate cancer biopsies from the Ghana Prostate Study. A total of 47 of 262 (18 percent) prostate cancers were <em>ERG</em>-positive, and negative <em>ERG</em> staining was associated with higher Gleason score. A meta-analysis combining results from Ghana with 40 additional studies showed the prevalence of <em>TMPRSS2</em>-<em>ERG</em> fusions in prostate cancer to be highest in men of European descent (49 percent) followed by Asian (27 percent) and then African (25 percent). The lower prevalence of <em>TMPRSS2</em>-<em>ERG</em> fusions in men of African descent implies that alternative genomic mechanisms might explain the disproportionately high prostate cancer burden in such populations.

<h4>Vitamin D</h4>
<p>Data from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial were used to examine prospectively the relationship between vitamin D status and prostate cancer risk among black men, a group at high risk for both low vitamin D status and prostate cancer. Serum 25(OH)D and 25(OH)D:DBP were not associated with overall prostate cancer risk, although 25(OH)D appeared inversely associated with nonaggressive disease, with a similar pattern of association among older men. There was significantly lower prostate cancer risk among men with higher circulating DBP concentrations, independent of 25(OH)D status, which represents a novel finding.

<h4><strong></strong>Microbiota</h4>
<p>To determine the epidemiologic and clinical relevance of gastric microbiota, investigators used 16 S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing analysis to characterize the composition and structure of the gastric microbial community of 80 paired samples (non-malignant and matched tumor tissues) from gastric cardia adenocarcinoma (GCA) patients. PICRUSt (a bioinformatics software package) was also used to predict microbial functional profiles. Compared to patients without family history of upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancer in the non-malignant gastric tissue microbiota, patients with family history of UGI cancer had higher <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (<em>Hp</em>) relative abundance and lower alpha diversity. Patients with higher tumor grade had higher <em>Hp</em> relative abundance, lower alpha diversity, altered beta diversity, and significant alterations in relative abundance of five KEGG functional modules in non-malignant gastric tissue microbiota. Patients without metastases had higher relative abundance of <em>Lactobacillales</em> than patients with metastases in non-malignant gastric tissue microbiota.

<h4>Vitamin B12 and Gastric Cancer</h4>
<p>An evaluation of one-carbon metabolism nutrients and upper gastrointestinal tract cancer was conducted using prediagnostic serum concentrations of several one-carbon metabolism nutrients in a nested case-control study within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. Lower prediagnostic vitamin B12 concentrations at baseline were associated with a 5.8-fold increased risk of noncardia gastric adenocarcinoma (NCGA). In contrast, pepsinogen I, a known serologic marker of gastric atrophy, was not associated with NCGA in this population. As vitamin B12 absorption requires intact gastric mucosa to produce acid and intrinsic factor, the findings suggest vitamin B12 as a possible serologic marker for the atrophic gastritis that precedes NCGA, one more strongly associated with subsequent NCGA than pepsinogen.&nbsp; (Miranti EH, Stolzenberg-Solomon R, Weinstein SJ, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28568053">Low vitamin B12 increases risk of gastric cancer: A prospective study of one-carbon metabolism nutrients and risk of upper gastrointestinal tract cancer</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2017; Epub June 21)</p>

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>The international Testicular Cancer Consortium combined five published genome-wide association studies of testicular germ cell tumor (TGCT; 3,558 cases and 13,970 controls) to identify new susceptibility loci. Eight new loci mapping to 2q14.2, 3q26.2, 4q35.2, 7q36.3, 10q26.13, 15q21.3, 15q22.31, and Xq28 achieved genome-wide significance. Most loci harbor biologically plausible candidate genes. Investigators refined previously reported associations at 9p24.3 and 19p12 by identifying one and three additional independent SNPs, respectively. In aggregate, the 39 independent markers identified to date explain 37 percent of father-to-son familial risk, eight percent of which can be attributed to the 12 new signals reported here.

There was no significant overall relationship between mean chromosome Y target-to-reference (T/R) ratio and TGCT. However, when restricted to familial TGCT cases, a significantly lower T/R ratio was observed in cases compared with controls.

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revealed up to seven independent cancer susceptibility loci in a small genomic region on chromosome 5p15.33, that includes the <em>TERT</em> and <em>CLPTM1L</em> genes. Specifically, variation in one of these loci (Region 2 in the <em>CLPTM1L</em> gene) has been found to increase risk of pancreatic cancer and testicular cancer, while decreasing risk of lung cancer and melanoma.</p>

<p>The symposium concluded with an interactive roundtable networking session. Eleven invited guests, most of whom are DCEG alumni and are experts in their fields, plus Drs. Dean and Lavigne, led discussions on different career categories: NIH-intramural, NIH-extramural, non-NIH federal agencies, academia, industry, non-profit organizations, and policy. The guests included: Dr. Hannah Arem, Dr. Megan Anderson Brooks, Dr. Yewon Cheon, Dr. Sarah Daugherty, Dr. Curt DellaValle, Dr. Elizabeth Hsu, Dr. Tram K. Lam, Dr. Gabriel Lai, Dr. Tamra Meyer, Dr. Arti Patel Varanasi, and Dr. Wei Tang.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We were pleased with the enthusiasm that fellows brought to the symposium,&rdquo; said Dr. Lavigne. &ldquo;It is our hope that this annual event will continue to provide a valuable educational and networking opportunity for fellows seeking to further develop their careers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In May 2017, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349686" sys_contentid="349686" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349686" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7277207">Philip R. Taylor, M.D., Sc.D.</a>, retired from the National Cancer Institute after 34 years of distinguished service. Dr. Taylor devoted his career to the conduct of epidemiological studies to inform cancer prevention strategies for malignancies of the upper gastrointestinal (UGI) tract, including esophageal and gastric cancers. His work involved a variety of research approaches, including cancer prevention trials, early detection studies, etiologic studies, laboratory-based molecular research, and clinical nutrition studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Phil brought a quiet authority to his work, and engendered an atmosphere of collaboration and team science,&rdquo; said Margaret Tucker, M.D., Director of the Human Genetics Program and former Chief of the Genetic Epidemiology Branch, where Phil was a senior investigator for the majority of his career.</p>
<p>Recently, he focused on identifying germline variants of susceptibility to UGI cancers through genome-wide association and family studies, evaluating tissue alterations in UGI cancers and premalignancy, and integrating germline and somatic data with functional genomics to understand etiology and identify biomarkers for early detection and prognosis.</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor was pivotal in the launch of the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303656" sys_contentid="303656" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303656" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7277208">Nutrition Intervention Trials (NIT)</a> in 1985, two randomized interventional trials involving 32,000 residents of Linxian, China, to evaluate the effects of vitamin and mineral supplementation on total mortality and total and cause-specific cancer mortality in a rural Chinese population. After the intervention phase ended in 1991, Dr. Taylor and colleagues determined the micronutrient combination of selenium/vitamin E/&szlig;-carotene reduced total mortality, total cancer mortality, and gastric cancer mortality. The protective effects of the intervention have lasted over two decades. These subjects continue to be followed to this day and serve as one of the most important cohorts for the study of upper GI cancer.</p>
<p>In addition to his ambitious research program, Dr. Taylor has been a thoughtful and generous mentor to scores of trainees, some here for short visits, others who completed post-doctoral training with him and went on to be life-long collaborators. During a visit to DCEG in April 2017, Dr. You-Lin Qiao, professor and director of the Department of Cancer Epidemiology at the National Cancer Center/Cancer Hospital, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences and Peking Union Medical College, reflected on Dr. Taylor: &ldquo;Phil was my first American mentor. We have kept our partnership over many years. Now, in my role at the Cancer Hospital in China, I send students to Phil and to the NCI for training. I credit Phil and the NCI for setting me on the track to my career in research, which began at NCI in 1989 with our collaboration on lung disease and health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Taylor received his medical degree from the University of Iowa in 1973 and completed his residency in internal medicine at Vanderbilt University in 1976. He joined the Centers for Disease Control in 1976 as an Epidemic Intelligence Service officer and while there, completed a residency in preventive medicine. He received his master&rsquo;s and doctoral degrees in epidemiology from the Harvard School of Public Health, and came to the NCI in 1983. He was Chief of the Cancer Prevention Studies Branch from 1987 to 2004, before joining the Genetic Epidemiology Branch in 2005, and the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch in 2016. Following his retirement, Dr. Taylor will serve as a special volunteer to the Division.</p>

<p>A study by the National Cancer Institute reports an association between a marker of exposure to aflatoxin, a poisonous chemical produced by a type of mold, and gallbladder cancer in a population of men and women in Shanghai, China.</p>
<p>Aflatoxin is an established risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma, a type of liver cancer. Although rare in the U.S., aflatoxin exposure is a concern in some areas of the world, including parts of China. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349671" sys_contentid="349671" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349671" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276010">Jill Koshiol, Ph.D.</a>, and colleagues investigated whether the exposure may also be associated with cancer of the gallbladder, a highly fatal disease. The investigators analyzed a marker of aflatoxin exposure in 209 gallbladder cancer patients and 250 controls with gallstones but no sign of cancer. The marker, the aflatoxin B1 (AFB1)-lysine molecule, was detected in plasma samples from 32 percent of cases and 15 percent of controls. Among individuals with detectable AFB1-lysine, individuals with levels in the highest 25 percent of the population were over seven times more likely to have gallbladder cancer, compared to those in the lowest 25 percent.</p>
<p>These findings add to the body of evidence linking aflatoxin exposure, as measured by AFB1-lysine in plasma, to risk of gallbladder cancer. The authors estimate that if established as a cause of this malignancy, aflatoxin exposure may account for up to 22 percent of gallbladder cancer cases in the study population. They note that, if verified in subsequent studies, the results may support public health programs aimed at reducing aflatoxin exposure to decrease the incidence of gallbladder cancer.</p>

<p>In an exceptionally productive research career spanning four decades, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=39&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349672" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7260448" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349672">Louise A. Brinton, M.P.H., Ph.D.</a>, made contributions to advance the health of women in the United States and around the world. She retired from Federal service at the end of April 2017.</p>
<p>Dr. Brinton practiced&mdash;and taught&mdash;hands-on epidemiology, leading field investigations on nearly every continent, from Latin America to West Africa, China to multiple U.S. locales. To each project, she brought a unique curiosity, sense of adventure and love of travel and cultural exchange.</p>
<p>She began her graduate work in anthropology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, but quickly switched to epidemiology. In 1976, she came to the NCI, to what is now the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), as a predoctoral fellow. She earned a Ph.D. in epidemiology from The Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in 1979, and subsequently conducted postdoctoral research at Oxford University in the United Kingdom under the tutelage of Sir Richard Doll, before returning to NCI. In 1984, she was appointed Acting Chief of the Environmental Studies Section, and in 1996 became Chief of the Environmental Epidemiology Branch, later renamed the Hormonal and Reproductive Epidemiology Branch (HREB). In 2016, she was named DCEG&rsquo;s first Scientific Advisor for International Activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Louise initiated and conducted seminal research studies to identify etiologic factors responsible for breast cancer, and other gynecologic malignancies,&rdquo; said DCEG Founding Director <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=26&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349665" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349665" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7260449" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349665">Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.</a> &ldquo;Over two decades at the helm of HREB, she shepherded scores of projects from pilot phase, through the development of rigorous protocols, resulting in well-designed, and fruitful studies, many of which will remain in use for the next generation of epidemiologists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>That body of work is represented in the over 600 peer-reviewed scientific manuscripts she authored, and dozens of book chapters, the majority of which focus on the etiology of breast, endometrial, and rarer gynecologic cancers, as well as male breast cancer, and hormonal factors influencing those malignancies.</p>
<p>When asked which study she is most proud of, Dr. Brinton quickly names the Invasive Cervical Cancer Study in Latin America. Women in this region experience some of the highest rates of cervical cancer in the world. Dr. Brinton and her colleagues set out to conduct the first large-scale epidemiological study of invasive cervical cancer in that part of the world, complete with biological samples and&mdash;to the surprises of many&mdash;complete sexual histories from both men and women in the study. The team hypothesized that sexual behavior among the men was responsible for the extremely high rates, and they designed a study to identify its contribution.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She was at the forefront of attempts to identify the viral etiology of cervical cancer,&rdquo; recalled <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349664" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349664" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7260450" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349664">Robert N. Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.</a>, Director of the DCEG Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, a life-long mentor to Dr. Brinton. &ldquo;Her efforts laid the groundwork for future studies that, with improved assays, definitively established HPV as the causal agent in cervical carcinogenesis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the various leadership roles she held in DCEG over the years, Dr. Brinton recruited investigators who have become leading experts in the epidemiology of gynecological cancers. Her trainees have gone on to direct research efforts within DCEG, and at leading departments of epidemiology across the country.</p>
<p>In addition to her ambitious research program, and the operation of a thriving Branch within DCEG, Dr. Brinton served on the Executive Board of the Society for Epidemiologic Research, and was elected president of the organization in 1990. She is the recipient of the U.S. Public Health Service Special Recognition Award, the NIH Director's Award for innovative leadership in women's health research, and the H.A. Tyroler Distinguished Alumni Award from The University of North Carolina. The American College of Epidemiology honored her with the 2009 Abraham Lilienfeld Award and in 2015 she received the Career Accomplishment Award from the Society for Epidemiologic Research.</p>
<p>Dr. Brinton has served as a senior editor for <em>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention</em>, and on the editorial board of several others, including the<em> Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Breast Cancer Research, </em>and the<em> International Journal of Epidemiology</em>. She has also been a member of and led many national and international committees to assist in determining future directions of research in cancer epidemiology.</p>

She joined REB as a postdoctoral fellow in 2010 and was promoted to research fellow in 2014.</p>
<p>Dr. Cahoon and colleagues are investigating how sensitivity to sunlight is influenced by external factors, such as use of photosensitizing medications. In a nationwide occupational cohort of U.S. radiological technologists, she found significantly increased risks of basal cell carcinoma for several photosensitizing agents, including prescription diuretics and menopausal hormone therapy. She has initiated two studies of photosensitizing medications (NSAIDS and estrogen-related factors) in relation to melanoma in the NIH-AARP cohort.</p>
<p>She is also evaluating the UV radiation dose-response relationship for skin cancer risks by wavelength, age at exposure, and anatomic site. &ldquo;To best inform skin cancer prevention, we need a clearer understanding regarding the influence of timing of UV radiation exposure over the life course, and relative exposure to different UV radiation wavelengths,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;For example, if UVA is found to be strongly related to skin cancer risk, prevention implications could include reformulating sunscreens and engineering window glass to block UVA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Cahoon is examining whether ionizing radiation is related to several outcomes that have been little studied (e.g., precancers, histological subtypes) and whether radiation-related risks are modified by factors for which there are limited data (e.g., age at exposure). Part of this effort involves the assessment of radiation-related risk for various cancers in the Lifespan Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Through a collaboration with the National Research Centre for&nbsp;Radiation Medicine in Ukraine, she is also leading a thyroid cancer case-control study nested in a cohort of emergency clean-up workers at the Chernobyl nuclear plant, who were exposed to a wide range of external radiation doses.</p>
<p>Few studies have evaluated the relationship between iodine-131 exposure and thyroid nodules, which are potential precursors for thyroid cancer. Dr. Cahoon and colleagues are examining incidence of new thyroid nodules in Belarus and Ukraine and progression of prevalent nodules. &ldquo;This work potentially provides a rare window into multistage carcinogenesis,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;These will be the first studies to evaluate whether nodule characteristics associated with increased risk of thyroid cancer, such as size and vascularization, are apparent at clinical diagnosis or whether these characteristics emerge and evolve over time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Three-dimensional (3D) printing has been used in medicine since the mid-1990s, primarily in the planning of complicated surgical procedures, rapidly evolving to include 3D-printed prosthetic limbs, skin, airway splints, and ears. In the last ten years, the cost of consumer-grade models brought the technology within reach of a far wider audience and research applications, including&mdash;perhaps unexpectedly&mdash;epidemiology. In a lab at the National Cancer Institute, a 3D printer just over half a cubic foot in volume sits atop a table, periodically whirring away as it extrudes plastic from a heated nozzle in precise patterns. This printer is being used to create tools for health physicists to improve their estimates of radiation dose for epidemiological studies. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=26&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349634" sys_contentid="349634" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349634" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7274901">Choonsik Lee, Ph.D.</a>, senior investigator in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=110&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302459" sys_contentid="302459" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302459" sys_variantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7274902">Radiation Epidemiology Branch</a> (REB), and head of the Dosimetry Unit, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=257&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302501" sys_contentid="302501" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302501" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7274903">Matthew Mille, Ph.D.</a>, postdoctoral fellow also&nbsp;in REB, are pioneering these techniques as part of the DCEG dosimetry program.</p>
<h3>Modeling Radiation Dose: A Two-pronged Approach</h3>
<p>Dosimetry, in the fields of medical physics and radiation protection, refers to the assessment of radiation dose received by the human body. Absorbed dose is a measure of the amount of energy deposited per unit of mass. This estimate is a necessary input for risk assessment for exposed individuals, as well as for epidemiological investigations evaluating the associations between radiation and adverse health effects, such as cancer. Medical procedures, ranging from x-ray computed tomography (CT) scans to proton therapy, are a common source of ionizing radiation.</p>
<p>The absorbed dose for specific organs (&ldquo;organ dose&rdquo;) depends on many factors, including the depth of the organ in the body, the density of the surrounding tissues, the size of the patient, and the specifics of the procedure. To make sense of this complexity, Dr. Lee&rsquo;s group uses &ldquo;phantoms&rdquo;, or models of the human body, that absorb radiation in a similar way to an actual patient. These phantoms can be purely computational, existing as lines of code and images within a computer, or they can be physical mannequins, custom-made of plastic and other materials. Each type comes with strengths and weaknesses; the investigators need both to accurately assess the radiation dose received by an individual.</p>

<p>Physical phantoms are made of stackable layers, each one dotted with a grid of holes in which tiny radiation sensors called dosimeters are inserted. A sensor-packed physical phantom exposed to a radiation source (e.g., placed in a CT scanner) can provide very reliable dose measurements, but doing so is expensive and time-intensive. Furthermore, the measured doses are constrained by the limited variety of physical phantoms available for purchase.</p>

<p>Computational phantoms employed in computer simulations fill in the gaps, accounting for doses to a wider range of body characteristics and machine settings. Because they are virtual, these models are cheaper to test (they don&rsquo;t require time in the CT scanner) and the calculations can be accelerated using high performance computing clusters. The computer models still depend, however, on some measurements from physical phantoms to provide realistic benchmark measurements and validation.</p>
<h3>Customization of the Phantoms</h3>
<p>Dr. Mille became interested in the possibility of using 3D printing to build phantoms early in his graduate studies. The project gained momentum once he found an enthusiastic mentor in Dr. Lee. Although life-size physical phantoms are available for purchase from a few manufacturers, they are very expensive and their relatively simple designs have not changed for decades.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our goal is to use 3D printing technology to customize phantoms and make them more realistic and versatile,&rdquo; said Dr. Mille. &ldquo;For instance, the two physical models the Division has now are both male. To simulate exposure to breast tissue, we can print prostheses to be attached to the male phantom to estimate radiation doses from breast cancer treatment.&rdquo; In addition to cost savings, they hope to create physical phantoms that more closely resemble their sophisticated computational models, and are more anatomically accurate and customizable.</p>
<p>Dr. Lee is also experimenting with how to incorporate patient body size into dose estimates. &ldquo;There are no obese physical phantoms,&rdquo; he said. A recent study he led, published in the American Journal of Roentgenology, showed that using normal-weight reference phantom to assess dose to an obese patient using particular CT machine settings can lead to overestimation of organ dose by as much as 200 percent. The team developed an ingenious solution: to print layers of &ldquo;body fat&rdquo; that can be attached to an existing phantom.</p>

<p>According to Dr. Mille, &ldquo;The presence of extra body fat effectively shields organs from external sources of radiation. Consequently, technical parameters in CT imaging must be altered for obese patients to maintain good image quality. This can result in higher doses for obese patients compared to those with normal BMI.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As part of this work, the team is exploring how 3D printing materials can be used to mimic the radiation attenuation characteristics of human tissues with different mass density, such as fat, soft-tissue, lung, and bone. To ensure that the printed phantom parts appropriately simulate human tissue, Dr. Mille images them on a CT scanner, and compares the resulting images to those taken of real patients.&nbsp; Through this work, they hope to create physical phantoms which respond to radiation in the same way as a patient.</p>
<h3>Adapting to New Technologies</h3>
<p>Innovation in the use of radiation in medical practice requires invention on the part of dosimetrists as well. To evaluate exposure to secondary neutrons produced inside the body during proton therapy, an emerging type of cancer treatment, existing physical phantoms are insufficient. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=257&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302501" sys_contentid="302501" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302501" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7274904">Gleb Kuzmin</a>, a predoctoral fellow in REB who also works with Dr. Lee, is spearheading research to estimate organ doses from such treatments. Step one is an effort to address a simple, yet stubborn, problem: the holes in each layer of the commercial phantoms are too small to fit a neutron detector. The obvious solution&mdash;drilling larger holes, is not an option, because modifying the expensive phantom for this test would make it less effective with the smaller dosimeters. Instead, the team will print copies of select slices of the human body with larger openings to accommodate the neutron detectors. Once the patchwork phantom is put back together, Mr. Kuzmin can validate his simulations by testing it in a proton treatment system and measuring the absorbed dose.</p>

<p>&ldquo;These phantoms have truly been an &lsquo;NIH family&rsquo; effort,&rdquo; said Dr. Lee. Many individuals have contributed their time and ideas, including Jacob Oshinsky, a 12-year-old 3D printing whiz and son of DCEG staff scientist <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=7&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1033589" sys_contentid="1033589" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033589" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7274905">Stephanie Weinstein, Ph.D.</a> On Take Your Child to Work Day in 2016, Jacob visited the 3D printing lab and introduced the dosimetry team to a range of different printing materials.</p>
<p>Through a collaboration with Roberto Mass-Moreno, Ph.D., of the Radiology and Imaging Sciences Department at the <a href="https://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/">NIH Clinical Center</a>, REB investigators have access to the Center&rsquo;s state-of-the-art imaging equipment&nbsp;with which they can test the printed phantoms.</p>
<p>The partnerships extend beyond NIH, to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), where some initial CT scanning was performed. Staff at the NIST Research Reactor are also helping to test novel printing materials. They expose the materials to a low-energy neutron beam emanating from the reactor to determine their elemental composition and, by extension, their radiation absorption properties.</p>
<p><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=22&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349642" sys_contentid="349642" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349642" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7274906">Amy Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez</a>, Chief of REB, remarked, &ldquo;DCEG has always been at the forefront of efforts to increase the public health impact of epidemiology by improving tools and methods. The 3D printed dosimetry phantom project by Drs. Lee and Mille is a perfect example of this cutting-edge work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Working together, these scientists aim to build more realistic human phantoms which will help to improve our understanding of the risks of medical radiation. There remain many challenges to overcome, but the researchers are optimistic. &ldquo;Our research so far has found that, with some resourcefulness, much can be accomplished despite limitations of current 3D printing technology,&rdquo; said Dr. Mille. &ldquo;It is only a matter of time until a life-size human phantom can be printed with the push of a button. We think we&rsquo;ll clone Dr. Lee first!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A common genetic variant is associated with higher risk of breast cancer among survivors of childhood cancer who received chest radiotherapy, according to a new study led by DCEG researchers. Childhood cancer survivors, particularly those who received radiation to the chest as part of their treatment, are known to be at elevated risk of developing breast cancer later in life. The researchers, led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=30&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349616" sys_contentid="349616" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349616" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275439">Lindsay Morton, Ph.D.</a>, senior investigator in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch, conducted a <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1057944" sys_contentid="1057944" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1057944" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7275440">genome-wide association study</a> of nearly 3,000 female survivors of childhood cancer to identify whether inherited genetic susceptibility may influence which survivors go on to develop breast cancer.

The variant did not appear to affect risk among survivors who did not receive chest radiotherapy.</p>
<p>The researchers also identified several additional regions with non-significant but promising associations with breast cancer in childhood cancer survivors. These findings, along with the significant variant at 1q41, should be investigated further in future studies. If confirmed, the authors hope that the results could be used to more precisely identify the risks and benefits of specific treatments for patients at the time of childhood cancer diagnosis. In addition, for patients who have already been treated, the results could be used to identify those with highest risk of developing breast cancer who might benefit most from increased screening.</p>

<p>Over the past several decades, DCEG has developed an interdisciplinary research program to unravel the epidemiologic, molecular, and pathologic underpinnings of mammographic breast density (MBD), one of the stronger risk factors for breast cancer among women. Senior investigator <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349652" sys_contentid="349652" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349652" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275988">Gretchen Gierach, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, and colleagues employ a range of technologies and approaches to improve the measurement of density, delineate risk factors that influence density, and understand mechanisms that mediate its relationship to breast cancer risk.</p>
<p>MBD refers to the appearance of breast tissue on a mammogram. Dense breasts contain more fibrous and glandular tissue (which shows up white or bright on imaging) than fat (which appears dark). Breast cancer and some benign breast conditions are denser than fat and also appear white on a mammogram.&nbsp;In general, women of child-bearing age tend to have denser breasts than postmenopausal women. Studies of the natural history of the breast have shown that density typically decreases as a woman ages. Breasts that are denser may be harder to successfully screen for early signs of tumorigenesis, since the white of the fibrous tissue can mask an emerging cancer.</p>
<p>MBD was identified as a risk factor for breast cancer before it became widely used to measure density at the time of screening. In the 1970s, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349664" sys_contentid="349664" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349664" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275989">Robert Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.</a>, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=39&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349672" sys_contentid="349672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349672" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275990">Louise Brinton, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1074440" sys_contentid="1074440" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1074440" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275991">Catherine Schairer, Ph.D.</a>, along with colleagues from the American Cancer Society, established one of the first prospective cohorts capable of evaluating relationships between MBD and risk of developing breast cancer. In the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project (BCDDP) cohort, they found that women who had a breast density of 75 percent or greater at the time of their baseline mammogram had an almost five-fold increased risk of breast cancer compared with women with no visible dense breast tissue (Byrne, 1995). This effect persisted for 10 or more years in this screened population, and was observed for premenopausal and postmenopausal women of all ages.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Until that point, there were a lot of questions as to whether density was truly a causal risk factor or whether there was some bias that was being caused by density masking a tumor,&rdquo; Dr. Gierach said. &ldquo;We now know that high MBD is a strong and independent breast cancer risk factor. However, the mechanisms driving this relationship are not clear, and we are still trying to figure out why.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Historically, most analyses of MBD have employed subjective visual categorizations or computer-assisted quantification of two-dimensional images (area density); both approaches ignore breast volume. Additionally, the measures themselves have evolved with time; today, most U.S.-based physicians use the American College of Radiology&rsquo;s Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) scoring system, in which radiologists visually classify density into four groups, ranging from almost entirely fatty to extremely dense. Supplementing this scoring system with standardized automated and quantitative assessment of volumetric MBD may allow for improvements in the utility of MBD as a marker of risk. &ldquo;We decided to explore a novel approach to measure MBD in three dimensions, as a volume,&rdquo; Dr. Gierach said.</p>
<p>In 2006, Dr. Gierach began collaborating with Dr. Brinton and Dr. Mark Sherman, formerly of the NCI, now at the Mayo Clinic, Florida, to develop the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/breast-cancer/radiology-evaluation-study-tissues-stamp-project">Breast Radiology Evaluation and Study of Tissues (BREAST) Stamp Project</a>, a project funded through a competitive award from the Stamp Act Fund. This complex field effort considered both the radiologic features of the breast through mammography and the histologic, molecular, and biochemical characteristics of breast tissue among women undergoing diagnostic image-guided breast biopsies at the University of Vermont (UVM) College of Medicine and its affiliated academic medical center, the UVM Medical Center. They found that volumetric MBD measures, assessed using a density phantom, were correlated with two-dimensional area density measurements and shared important associations with several epidemiological factors (Gierach, 2014). However, the data also revealed some differences; most notably, among obese women, measured absolute density was higher with volumetric methods, suggesting that breast cancer risk assessments may vary between these techniques.</p>
<p>Dr. Gierach is working to refine methods for measuring MBD as a volume in tissue surrounding lesions targeted for biopsy. Little is known about the spatial distribution of dense breast tissue and whether there are areas within the breast that are &ldquo;riskier&rdquo; dense regions. &ldquo;We found that regional differences in MBD clearly occur among women diagnosed with benign breast disease,&rdquo; she said (Gierach, 2016). In the future, she will conduct studies to further characterize regional heterogeneity in MBD among women whose biopsy results range from benign to cancerous.</p>
<p>Investigators are also assessing non-ionizing imaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound, which may be better suited for safely measuring volumetric density particularly among young or high-risk women, or in other situations where it is desirable to perform more frequent measurements. Dr. Gierach recently completed the clinically-focused field effort of the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/breast-cancer/ultrasound-study-tamoxifen">Ultrasound Study of Tamoxifen</a>, in which she and colleagues used novel ultrasound tomography to determine changes in volumetric breast density within the first year of tamoxifen therapy. They found ultrasound tomography sound speed estimates to be highly reproducible surrogate measures of volumetric breast density (Khodr, 2015). These results will inform the development of methods for serial assessment of density, an important area for future investigation as density changes may translate into changes in breast cancer risk.</p>

<p>As the measurements of MBD continue to improve, a parallel effort is underway to determine how density influences risk, tumor initiation and/or progression at the molecular level.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One thing we&rsquo;re trying to understand is if there are patterns or markers within the breast tissue that can differentiate women with high density who will go on to develop breast cancer versus women with high density who don&rsquo;t develop breast cancer,&rdquo; said postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/meb-fellows#Mullooly">Maeve Mullooly, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a></p>
<p>To correlate MBD to tissue-level biomarkers, investigators have tapped into data from the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/cancer-types/breast-cancer/breast-cancer-case-control-study-poland">DCEG Polish Breast Cancer Study</a>. They have collected mammograms for density assessment from a subset of the cases from whom snap-frozen breast tissues were collected for molecular profiling studies (Sun, Gierach, 2013). &ldquo;Importantly, we and others have observed that density is similar for both hormone receptor-positive and -negative breast cancers,&rdquo; Dr. Gierach said. &ldquo;These findings give broad relevance to MBD as a general marker of breast cancer risk&rdquo; (Razzaghi, 2013).</p>
<p>Dr. Gierach is also exploring the relationships among circulating hormones, MBD, and terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) involution in the BREAST Stamp Project. TDLUs&mdash;milk-secreting structures in the breast&mdash;are the tissue of origin for most breast cancers.&nbsp;TDLU involution, or a reduction in the number and size of TDLUs and their secretory substructures called acini, is a normal process of aging.</p>

<p>Dr. Gierach and colleagues have found that quantitative measures of TDLU involution and MBD are correlated markers of breast cancer risk (Gierach, 2016). These relationships might reflect cumulative exposure to endogenous hormones (Oh, 2016; Gierach, 2015; Sampson, 2017) and growth factors (Horne, 2016). &ldquo;Our latest findings suggest that elevated estrogens are associated with higher MBD, reduced TDLU involution, and increased breast cancer risk, particularly among postmenopausal women,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>In addition, the team is combining digital pathology and novel, deep learning approaches to examine histological features of breast tissue (Bejnordi, 2017). &ldquo;This technology allows us to examine patterns of tissue organization that may be associated with breast density, and can complement the visual interpretation of the tissue by a pathologist,&rdquo; Dr. Mullooly said. Using data from the BREAST Stamp Project, investigators are applying these novel approaches to examine if there are unique features of breast biopsy tissues that are associated with localized volumetric density measures, that may also be associated with differential breast lesion diagnoses.</p>

<p>Breast cancer is known to vary significantly by race and ethnicity. Though scientists have established MBD as a strong risk factor for breast cancer, most of these studies have targeted white women in Western countries.

<p>&ldquo;In general, Asian women have denser breasts than white women, and yet, they experience lower breast cancer incidence overall,&rdquo; Dr. Yang said. &ldquo;It is possible that a variety of complex factors contribute to the unique features of breast cancer among Asian women, including cohort/period effects, distinct genetic or non-genetic exposures, and tumor biology.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Dr. Yang and colleagues are utilizing the resources of a breast cancer screening program in China, through a collaboration with the Hospital of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CHCAMS). Radiologists at CHCAMS assessed MBD on digital mammograms and categorized results using BI-RADS. Researchers would like to study the risk associated with MBD; however, the screening program is only available in limited areas in China and will not have long-term follow-up, which precludes their ability to comprehensively address this question.</p>
<p>Instead, they are investigating the associations between known breast cancer risk factors and MBD among screening program participants. They are also evaluating the association between MBD and breast cancer subtypes using breast cancer patient data collected at CHCAMS. &ldquo;This type of analysis has been conducted in Caucasian populations, where the general agreement is that MBD is associated with increased risk for all tumor subtypes,&rdquo; Dr. Yang said. &ldquo;But, we don&rsquo;t know if that&rsquo;s true in Chinese women.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As BI-RADS scoring is a subjective visual assessment metric for MBD, Drs. Yang and Gierach have also installed automated quantitative density measurement software at CHCAMS to obtain volume density metrics that have been associated with breast cancer risk in other populations. Investigators plan to use the software in future studies and hope to expand the effort to other screening sites around China.</p>

<p>MBD may also be an important consideration for women already diagnosed with breast cancer, particularly estrogen-receptor positive breast cancer which is the most common subtype diagnosed. Emerging evidence suggests that MBD decline could serve as a potential biosensor of response to tamoxifen treatment. In a recent study within Kaiser Permanente Northwest, led by former DCEG fellow Dr. Sarah Nyante (now an Assistant Professor at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), Dr. Gierach,&nbsp;Dr. Hoover, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=22&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349642" sys_contentid="349642" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349642" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275993">Amy Berrington, D.Phil.</a>, and colleagues, reported that patients who experienced large reductions in MBD following tamoxifen treatment had improved prognosis (Nyante, 2015). &ldquo;This finding suggests that serial MBD measures could have value for clinicians and patients when deciding whether to continue tamoxifen therapy or change clinical management,&rdquo; Dr. Gierach said. The potential translational implications of this work were recently highlighted in a <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em> commentary led by Dr. Mullooly (Mullooly, 2016).</p>
<p>Contralateral breast cancer is the most common second cancer among women with primary breast cancer. However, it&rsquo;s unclear whether MBD changes are associated with risk for development of a second primary contralateral breast cancer among breast cancer patients. Dr. Gierach, Dr. Mullooly, Dr. Berrington and colleagues are developing a new study within the Kaiser cohort to address this question. &ldquo;There is a growing number of breast cancer survivors and we need to better understand what breast density means in those women,&rdquo; Dr. Mullooly said.</p>
<p>In a separate analysis of breast cancer patients within the U.S. Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, Dr. Gierach found that, after accounting for patient and tumor characteristics, elevated MBD was not associated with risk of death&mdash;an important and reassuring message for women with high MBD (Gierach, 2012). This work suggests that risk factors for the development of breast cancer may not necessarily be the same as factors influencing the risk of death after breast cancer has developed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the future, Dr. Gierach and colleagues will continue to build an integrative approach to investigate key issues in breast cancer and MBD research. &ldquo;Ultimately, the goal of our research is to facilitate the development of improved strategies for risk stratification, prevention, early detection, and treatment of breast cancer,&rdquo; Dr. Gierach said. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s still so much to learn.&rdquo;</p>

He joined the Laboratory of Translational Genomics (LTG) as a postdoctoral fellow in 2012, transitioned to LGS in 2015, and was promoted to research fellow in 2016.</p>
<p>Dr. Machiela is leading studies of large-scale genetic mosaicism to investigate the causes of acquired mosaic alterations and their impact on cancer risk. Genetic mosaicism results from a DNA mutation that is present in some of the body's cells but not in others. A person with mosaicism has a mixture of normal and mutated cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mosaicism is a somatic event, meaning a mutation occurs sometime in life after fertilization. It is not an inherited genetic variant,&rdquo; Dr. Machiela said. &ldquo;We define mosaicism quite broadly; it can be limited to a one base pair change in your genome different from what you inherited. Or, it can be as large as an entire chromosome that is lost or duplicated.&rdquo; <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2017-03/research-publications/mosaicism-early-marker">Read more about DCEG research on genetic mosaicism</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Machiela and collaborators have published a number of studies estimating the frequency and distribution of mosaicism in existing genotyped collections of blood and buccal DNA. Now, he is utilizing an unparalleled set of genotype data &ndash; 200,000 DCEG samples, 500,000 genotyped samples from the UK Biobank, and a merged international mosaicism consortium of over 1 million samples &ndash; to expand the size and scope of his research on mosaicism and cancer risk.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Machiela is developing improved approaches for detecting genetic mosaicism. &ldquo;Previous studies have focused on detecting mosaic events larger than 2 megabases in size and affecting cellular proportions of 10% or greater,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This is a conservative threshold to ensure detected events have a high true positive rate. We are now exploring ways to use haplotype data to improve the array-based detection of events affecting a smaller proportion of cells.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Relatively little is known of the mechanisms that initiate and select for mosaic alterations. Results from previous work suggests inherited germline variation (e.g. at <em>TCL1A</em>) or environmental exposures (e.g. smoking) may predispose to mosaicism. Dr. Machiela is utilizing genotyped samples from the UK Biobank and other datasets to examine endogenous and exogenous factors influencing acquisition of detectible mosaicism.</p>
<p>In recent studies, Dr. Machiela and colleagues found evidence to suggest that mosaicism increases cancer risk for hematologic malignancies and select solid tumor subtypes. He is expanding this work to examine the influence of mosaicism on cancer risk in various populations and tissue types.</p>
<p>Dr. Machiela also conducts and analyzes genetic association studies to better understand the genetic architecture of different cancers (e.g. pediatric and common adult cancers). He is expanding association studies to incorporate whole-exome/genome sequencing data, and combining data on germline and somatic variation to better understand cancer genetic etiology and improve risk prediction.</p>
<p>Specifically, he is leading a genome-wide association study on Ewing sarcoma (ES) to identify susceptibility regions and elucidate the underlying genetic architecture of ES. &ldquo;Pediatric cancers like ES provide a unique opportunity to study a homogenous tumor with potentially larger genetic contribution to risk,&rdquo; Dr. Machiela said.</p>
<p>Dr. Machiela is also the creator of a web-based tool, <a href="https://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/LDlink/">LDlink</a>, which interactively explores linkage disequilibrium across population groups from the 1000 Genomes Project. LDlink is tailored for investigators interested in mapping disease susceptibility loci by generating output linking correlated alleles and highlighting putative functional variants.</p>

She has developed a robust scientific program focused on genetic susceptibility to osteosarcoma, a rare bone cancer, and the genomics of carcinogenic human papillomaviruses (HPV), through highly collaborative projects.</p>
<h3>Etiology of Osteosarcoma</h3>
<p>Osteosarcoma is the most commonly diagnosed primary malignancy of bone in children and young adults. However, its etiology is poorly characterized. Although cure rates are fairly good for disease caught early, metastatic disease is usually fatal. &ldquo;We are conducting germline genetic studies of osteosarcoma to better understand the role that genetic variation plays in risk and patient outcomes, and to identify new genes or genomic regions that may be important in osteosarcoma pathogenesis,&rdquo; Dr. Mirabello said.</p>
<p>Alongside <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=43&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349621" sys_contentid="349621" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349621" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276366">Sharon A. Savage, M.D.</a>, Chief of the Clinical Genetics Branch, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" sys_contentid="349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349630" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276367">Stephen J. Chanock, M.D.</a>, Division Director, and colleagues, Dr. Mirabello played a key role in the first international, multi-institution genome-wide association study (GWAS) of osteosarcoma. The team also conducted large epidemiologic and meta-analytic studies that clarified osteosarcoma incidence patterns and risk groups. Now, Dr. Mirabello is leading the assembly of additional patients to extend the sample size for a second GWAS. &ldquo;International collaborations are essential so we can collect enough cases of this rare cancer,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m always working to establish new collaborations to accomplish this important work.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Mirabello led the first GWAS study of osteosarcoma metastasis and identified a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the <em>NFIB</em> gene that was significantly associated with the presence of metastasis at diagnosis. &ldquo;The <em>NFIB </em>manuscript is one of my favorite papers, because the data fit together to tell a compelling story,&rdquo; Dr. Mirabello said. &ldquo;First, we conducted the GWAS agnostically looking for markers of osteosarcoma metastasis. We found a SNP in <em>NFIB</em> that was strongly associated with metastatic disease at diagnosis in several different ethnic groups. Further, our functional studies showed that the risk SNP was associated with a decrease in <em>NFIB</em> expression, which led to increased osteosarcoma cell migration, proliferation, and colony formation. Together, these findings suggest that <em>NFIB</em> is an osteosarcoma metastasis susceptibility gene.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are conducting germline genetic studies of osteosarcoma to better understand the role that genetic variation plays in risk and patient outcomes, and to identify new genes or genomic regions that may be important in osteosarcoma pathogenesis.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Dr. Mirabello is expanding her genomic studies beyond osteosarcoma to identify genetic variants associated with the risk of developing other pediatric solid tumors, including rhabdomyosarcoma and medulloblastoma. As a next step, she is exploring whether this same variation in <em>NFIB</em> is associated with metastasis for other pediatric cancers. She will also look for additional common variants associated with susceptibility and outcomes.</p>
<p>The GWAS data only tell part of the story. Dr. Mirabello and colleagues are also looking at the role of rare variants in osteosarcoma susceptibility. In a recent study, they showed that inherited variations in a known tumor suppressor gene (<em>TP53</em>) among children and adolescents with osteosarcoma are more common than previously thought. In fact, about 1 percent of the osteosarcoma patients in the study had a pathogenic or possibly pathogenic mutation in <em>TP53</em>, compared to the 3 percent expected carrier rate.</p>
<p>To expand the search for rare variants, Dr. Mirabello is using whole-exome sequencing of osteosarcoma patients to look for mutations in other known cancer-causing genes. In addition, she is using the exome data to look for novel genes with an excess of rare variants in the cases. &ldquo;It is important to determine the extent to which rare germline mutations contribute to osteosarcoma etiology, and to distinguish their effects from those observed in association with more common, lower penetrance SNPs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Mirabello is also expanding upon her previous finding that tall stature is associated with an increased risk of osteosarcoma by leading a study to evaluate genetic risk scores for height and risk of osteosarcoma. &ldquo;Tall height is one of the strongest risk factors for osteosarcoma,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re trying to determine if genetically determined height is what&rsquo;s related to risk of osteosarcoma, versus other environmental factors that affect height.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>HPV Carcinogenicity</h3>
<p>There are over 200 types of HPV. For reasons largely unknown, only about a dozen HPV types cause virtually all cases of cervical cancer, and a large proportion of other anogenital and oropharyngeal cancers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We know a lot about the natural history of an HPV infection and the multiple stages of cervical carcinogenesis,&rdquo; Dr. Mirabello said. &ldquo;DCEG scientists have an outstanding record of studying HPV natural history and its translation to screening/vaccination strategies for over 30 years. But, we do not know why HPV types, and closely related variant lineages within a type, profoundly differ in risk of cancer, or why common and typically benign carcinogenic HPV infections only sometimes cause cancer. This indicates that additional risk factors are important for carcinogenesis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Researchers know that viral genetic factors are important because HPV types and variant lineages within a type, which differ greatly in carcinogenicity, are defined by differences in their nucleotide sequence. In 2010, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=16&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349609" sys_contentid="349609" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349609" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276368">Mark Schiffman, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, had initially proposed the HPV Genomics Project to compare genetically related HPV genomes and to determine which SNPs or lineages make an HPV type more or less carcinogenic. However, the project never moved forward because even with the relatively simple HPV genome, the only available HPV sequencing methods were slow, labor intensive, and costly.</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin: 0 5px 10px 30px;">
<p>&ldquo;Historically, the dogma has been that HPV 16s are all the same. We&rsquo;re beginning to realize that there&rsquo;s a lot more to the story.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>About three years ago, Dr. Mirabello re-initiated the project after Michael Cullen, Ph.D., and Joseph Boland, M.S., in the Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory, successfully developed a high-throughput assay to whole-genome sequence HPV 16. &ldquo;Using what we know about human next-generation sequencing, we were able to design and optimize the assay for HPV genome sequencing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It had never been done before, so it was kind of like inventing the wheel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Mirabello and team spent the first year designing a sequence analysis pipeline and validating this novel approach. In an 800-sample pilot study, they demonstrated excellent concordance with the gold standard of sequencing and uncovered several novel observations with these next-generation sequence-based data. They were able to annotate numerous novel HPV 16 SNPs that may impact infection outcome, large deleted regions, and HPV 16 variant lineage co-infections.</p>
<p>The assay has now been extended to genome sequence all of the high-risk HPV types. To date, the team has sequenced over 10,000 high-risk HPV whole-genomes. &ldquo;This high-throughput approach enables the practical sequencing of thousands of HPV-containing specimens from informative populations, and signals a new era in the study of HPV and related cancers,&rdquo; Dr. Mirabello said.</p>
<p>HPV 16, which causes approximately half of all cervical cancers worldwide, can be grouped into 4 main lineages and at least 10 sublineages. Recently, Dr. Mirabello and colleagues conducted the largest case-control study of HPV 16 variant lineage risk of cervical precancer and cancer and found that different sublineages have very strong and specific risks. Grouping outcomes and lineages together, as previously done, conceals important qualitative heterogeneity in both viral lineages and disease outcomes. Certain lineages were specifically associated with adenocarcinomas with relative risks over 100, and these glandular lesions are very hard to detect with routine screening. &ldquo;These findings suggest that a finer level of grouping of HPV 16 variant lineage classifications and disease outcomes is warranted,&rdquo; Dr. Mirabello said. &ldquo;A highly specific HPV variant test could conceivably have clinical and prevention implications for adenocarcinomas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Mirabello&rsquo;s latest work (in press at <em>Cell</em>) revealed that HPV16 has tremendous variability below even the level of variant lineages. Within the HPV16 lineages there are thousands of viral isolates, each with a unique genome. Very few women who tested positive for HPV16 were infected with the same isolate. In contrast, the paired HPV16 genomes within a woman at multiple HPV16-infected body sites (oral, anal, and vulvar) were nearly all the same. &ldquo;This suggests there is only high isolate diversity across different women,&rdquo; Dr. Mirabello said.</p>
<p>Importantly, she also discovered that women with benign infections had more amino acid changing variants throughout the HPV16 genome. In particular, the HPV16 oncogene, <em>E7</em>, but not the other major oncogene, <em>E6</em>, was strikingly devoid of these variants in cancers from around the world compared to higher levels in the controls. HPV16&rsquo;s unique risk might be due in part to a particular structure of the E7 protein.</p>
<p>This research is contributing to a paradigm shift in the way scientists think about HPV16. &ldquo;Historically, the dogma has been that HPV16s are all the same,&rdquo; Dr. Mirabello said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re beginning to realize that there&rsquo;s a lot more to the story. You have HPV16, but you also have a specific lineage, and even further you have a specific isolate. This urges a re-evaluation of HPV natural history and the clinical implications of HPV mutation rates, transmission, clearance, and persistence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Mirabello has expanded this approach to look at other high-risk types of HPV. &ldquo;The ultimate plan is to look across the HPV types and see if we can find something shared that&rsquo;s associated with progression or clearance,&rdquo; Dr. Mirabello said. &ldquo;Either one would be important for understanding viral carcinogensis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a new study from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), researchers found a high prevalence of cancer at baseline screening in individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare inherited disorder that leads to a higher risk of developing certain cancers. The research demonstrates the feasibility of a new, comprehensive cancer surveillance protocol for this high-risk population.</p>
<p>The study was led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=43&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349621" sys_contentid="349621" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349621" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276456">Sharon A. Savage, M.D.</a>, of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), and was published with a companion meta-analysis on August 3, 2017, in <em>JAMA Oncology</em>. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>LFS is most often caused by germline, or hereditary, mutations in a tumor suppressor gene known as TP53. The disorder results in many kinds of cancers&mdash;including bone and soft-tissue cancers (sarcomas), breast cancer, brain tumors, and cancer of the adrenal gland&mdash;that frequently occur at young ages. Individuals with LFS have an approximately 50 percent chance of developing cancer by age 40, and up to a 90 percent chance by age 60. Many patients with LFS develop more than one primary cancer over their lifetimes.</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>In a new study from the National Cancer Institute, researchers report an association between the hormone ghrelin, measured in blood serum, and risk of colorectal cancer in a population of male Finnish smokers.</p>
<p>Ghrelin, a hormone produced in the stomach, is involved in a variety of metabolic functions ranging from stimulation of gastric acid and regulation of motility to appetite control. Prospective studies have reported that low concentrations of serum ghrelin are linked with an increased risk of developing oesophageal and gastric cancers.</p>
<p>To explore the relationship between serum ghrelin concentration and subsequent risk of colorectal cancer, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/murphy-gwen">Gwen A. Murphy, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, and colleagues conducted a case-control study nested within the <a href="https://atbcstudy.cancer.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study</a>. They observed an unexpected pattern: individuals whose serum concentrations were low had a 10-fold increase of developing colorectal cancer within 10 years of their blood draw. Conversely, low-serum ghrelin concentration was associated with a significantly decreased risk of developing colorectal cancer more than 20 years after their blood draw.</p>
<p>These results suggest that ghrelin concentrations may vary across the carcinogenic process. The authors note that further studies are necessary to replicate these findings and to explore variation in serum concentration across the natural history of colorectal cancer.</p>

<h4>Estrogen Receptor-negative and <em>BRCA1</em></h4>
<p>Members of the OncoArray Network conducted a genome-wide association study using 21,468 estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer cases and 100,594 controls combined with 18,908 <em>BRCA1</em> mutation carriers (9,414 with breast cancer), all of European origin. Ten variants at nine new loci were identified at p&lt; 5&times;10<sup>-8</sup> in addition to replication or consistent associations for most variants previously reported in ER-negative disease or <em>BRCA1</em> mutation carrier GWAS. The total 125 variants explain approximately 16% of the familial risk of this breast cancer subtype. There was high genetic correlation (0.72) between risk of ER-negative breast cancer and breast cancer risk for <em>BRCA1</em> mutation carriers. These findings may lead to improved risk prediction and inform further fine-mapping and functional work to better understand the biological basis of ER-negative breast cancer. (Milne RL, Kuchenbaecker KB, Michailidou K, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=%22Nature+genetics%22%5BJour%5D+AND+2017%5Bpdat%5D+AND+Milne+RL%5Bauthor%5D&amp;cmd=detailssearch">Identification of ten variants associated with risk of estrogen-receptor-negative breast cancer</a>. <em>Nat Genet</em> 2017; Epub Oct 23).

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>A genome-wide association study of breast cancer in 122,977 cases and 105,974 controls of European ancestry, and 14,068 cases and 13,104 controls of East Asian ancestry was conducted using the OncoArray chip. The study identified 65 new loci that are associated with overall breast cancer risk at p&lt;&thinsp;5&times;10<sup>-8</sup>. There was a strong overlap between candidate target genes and somatic driver genes in breast tumors. In addition, the heritability of breast cancer due to all single-nucleotide polymorphisms in regulatory features was two- to-five-fold enriched relative to the genome-wide average, with strong enrichment for particular transcription factor binding sites.

<h4>Thyroid Dysfunction and Mortality Risk</h4>
<p>A large, prospective study revealed that women with hyperthyroidism had an elevated risk of breast cancer mortality after 60 years of age (hazard ratio = 2.04) compared to women without thyroid disease. Women with hypothyroidism were at increased risk for mortality from diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease.

<h4>Human Papillomavirus</h4>
<p>A novel HPV whole-genome sequencing technique was used to evaluate an exceptionally large collection of 5,570 HPV 16-positive cervical samples to determine whether viral genetic variation influences risk of cervical precancer and cancer. Among thousands of unique HPV 16 genomes, very few women shared the identical HPV 16 sequence, which should stimulate a careful re-evaluation of the clinical implications of HPV mutation rates, transmission, clearance, and persistence. In case-control analyses, HPV 16 in the controls had significantly more amino acid changing variants throughout the genome. Strikingly, the <em>E7</em> oncogene was devoid of variants in precancer/cancer samples, compared to controls; we confirmed this in cancers from around the world. Strict conservation of the 98 amino acids of E7, which disrupts Rb function, is critical for HPV 16 carcinogenesis, presenting a highly specific target for etiologic and therapeutic research. (Mirabello L, Yeager M, Yu K, et al. HPV16 E7 <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886384">Genetic Conservation Is Critical to Carcinogenesis</a>. <em>Cell</em> 2017).

<h4>Genetic Loci Associated with Family History</h4>
<p>Following up on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) among Han Chinese, investigators examined single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with family history (FH) of upper gastrointestinal cancer (UGI) cancer among cases with ESCC. A total of 19 SNPs were associated with FH of UGI cancer in ESCC cases with P&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;10<sup>-5</sup> in a meta-analysis of NCI and Henan GWAS data. In stage 2 with additional Henan subjects, the association for rs79747906 (18p11.31) was replicated, with a pooled odds ratio of 1.59. The findings may provide important insights into new low-penetrance susceptibility regions involved in the susceptibility of families with multiple UGI cancer cases.

<h4>Cholangiocarcinoma Risk Factors</h4>
<p>Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare resource, investigators found that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with approximately three-fold increased risk of intrahepatic (ICC) and extrahepatic (ECC) cholangiocarcinomas. Other metabolic conditions, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, smoking, autoimmune/inflammatory conditions (type 1 diabetes and gout), viral hepatitis, alcohol-related disorders, and bile duct conditions were also associated with both cancer types.

<h4>Germline <em>TP53</em> Variants</h4>
<p>Li-Fraumeni syndrome is an autosomal-dominant cancer predisposition disorder associated with pathogenic germline variants in <em>TP53</em>, with a high penetrance over an individual's lifetime; the actual population prevalence is still unclear, most likely due to biased selection of cancer-affected families. To provide population estimates, the authors analyzed the prevalence of potentially pathogenic <em>TP53</em> variants in three aggregated datasets composed of 63,983 individuals unselected for personal or familial cancer history. Based on this analysis, the prevalence of potentially pathogenic <em>TP53</em> exonic variants may be as high as 0.2% (range = 0.06&ndash;0.2%), up to 10 times higher than previously estimated from family-based studies. These results point to the need for further studies aimed at evaluating cancer penetrance modifiers, as well as the cancer risk associated with rare <em>TP53</em> variants, to enrich knowledge of variant curation for clinical purposes.

<h4>Skin Pigmentation</h4>
<p>A genome-wide association study of 1570 Africans identified variants significantly associated with skin pigmentation, which clustered in four genomic regions that together account for almost 30% of the phenotypic variation. Examining ethnically diverse African genomes, variants in or near <em>SLC24A5</em>, <em>MFSD12</em>, <em>DDB1</em>, <em>TMEM138</em>, <em>OCA2</em>, and <em>HERC2</em> were significantly associated with skin pigmentation. Functional analyses indicate that <em>MFSD12</em> encodes a lysosomal protein that affects melanogenesis in zebrafish and mice, and that mutations in melanocyte-specific regulatory regions near <em>DDB1/TMEM138</em> correlate with expression of ultraviolet response genes under selection in Eurasians. These findings may help determine if humans with certain DNA sequences are more or less susceptible to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation or respond to cellular stress differently.

<h4>Dietary Flavonoids</h4>
<p>Flavonoids are bioactive polyphenolic compounds found in fruits, vegetables, and beverages of plant origin. Data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study showed that the highest quintile of total flavonoid intake was associated with a 24 percent lower risk of head and neck cancer compared with the lowest quintile. Notably, anthocyanidins were associated with a 28 percent lower risk of head and neck cancer and flavanones were associated with a 22 percent lower risk of head and neck cancer. No associations between flavonoid intake and risk of esophageal or gastric cancers were found.

<h4>Telomere Length</h4>
<p>Two investigations examined the relationship between telomere length and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). In the first, genotypes from nine telomere length-associated variants for 10,784 cases and 20,406 cancer-free controls from six genome-wide association studies of RCC were aggregated into a weighted genetic risk score predictive of leukocyte telomere length. The data suggested that individuals with inherited predisposition to longer telomeres are at increased risk of developing RCC. The second study evaluated leukocyte telomere length as a potential biomarker of survival after diagnosis of RCC. Data from 684 cases from the U.S. Kidney Cancer Study and 241 cases from the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovary Screening Trial suggested that shorter leukocyte telomere length is an independent marker of poor RCC prognosis, particularly for stage-I disease.

<h4>Cholangiocarcinoma Risk Factors</h4>
<p>Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare resource, investigators found that non-alcoholic fatty liver disease was associated with approximately three-fold increased risk of intrahepatic (ICC) and extrahepatic (ECC) cholangiocarcinomas. Other metabolic conditions, including obesity and type 2 diabetes, smoking, autoimmune/inflammatory conditions (type 1 diabetes and gout), viral hepatitis, alcohol-related disorders, and bile duct conditions were also associated with both cancer types.

<h4>Insulin Resistance</h4>
<p>Investigators examined prediagnostic serum insulin, glucose, and indices of insulin resistance (insulin: glucose molar ratio and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance [HOMA-IR]) and lung cancer risk within the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. The average time between blood collection and lung cancer was 9.6 years. Fasting serum insulin levels were 8.7 percent higher among a non-case subcohort than cases. Men in the fourth quartile of insulin had a significantly higher risk of lung cancer than those in the first quartile (HR=2.10). A similar relationship was seen with HOMA-IR (HR=1.83).

<h4>Time to First Cigarette</h4>
<p>Using data from the prospective National Lung Screening Trial (NLST), researchers evaluated whether adding time-to-first-cigarette (TTFC), a nicotine dependency measurement, can improve lung-cancer risk-prediction models. Smokers with TTFC&ge;60 minutes had much lower risk of developing or dying from lung cancer, compared to smokers with TTFC&le;5 minutes. Including TTFC, a low-cost, non-invasive question, into risk models might better identify smokers with lower risk, and therefore could be a safe, convenient tool to improve identification of individuals who benefit less from lung-cancer screening.

<h4>Germline Variants in Familial Melanoma</h4>
<p>Known high-risk genes account for&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;40% of risk for cutaneous malignant melanoma (CMM) in melanoma-prone families, suggesting the existence of additional high-risk genes or perhaps a polygenic mechanism involving multiple genetic modifiers. The investigators systematically characterized rare germline variants in 42 established melanoma genes among 144 CMM patients in 76 American CMM families without known mutations using data from whole-exome sequencing. They identified a number of rare loss-of-function variants and predicted deleterious missense variants that were enriched in CMM cases, some demonstrating co-segregation with disease within families, such as variants in <em>TYR</em>, <em>PLA2G6</em>, and <em>ATM</em>. Several variants also showed evidence for enrichment in population-based sporadic CMM cases. Further, compared with their corresponding controls, familial CMM cases had an increased burden of rare germline variants in <em>TYR</em> and <em>OCA2</em>, and sporadic cases had an increased burden for <em>TYR</em>, <em>TYRP1</em>, and <em>TINF2</em>. In particular, CMM cases seemed to have a higher frequency of rare variants in albinism-associated genes. The results suggest that rare nonsynonymous variants in low- or intermediate-risk CMM genes may influence familial CMM predisposition.

<h4>Methods and Tool Development</h4>
<p>In an effort to improve reproducibility in microbiome research, the authors conducted a baseline investigation of variability in taxonomic profiling for the Microbiome Quality Control (MBQC) project baseline study (MBQC-base). Blinded specimen sets from human stool, chemostats, and artificial microbial communities were sequenced by 15 laboratories and analyzed using nine bioinformatics protocols. Variability depended most on biospecimen type and origin, followed by DNA extraction, sample handling environment, and bioinformatics. Analysis of artificial community specimens revealed differences in extraction efficiency and bioinformatic classification. The results may guide researchers in experimental design choices for gut microbiome studies.

<h4>Insulin-Like Growth Factors</h4>
<p>Prediagnosis obesity and diabetes are associated with survival from pancreatic cancer, but the underlying mechanisms have not been characterized. Because both are associated with dysregulation in circulating insulin-like growth factor (IGF) levels, investigators evaluated the associations of prediagnosis IGF levels (IGF-I, IGF-II) and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3) with pancreatic cancer survival in the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Higher IGF-II and IGFBP-3 levels were associated with pancreatic cancer survival among men but not women. There were no statistically significant associations between IGF-I concentrations, IGF-I/IGFBP-3, and pancreatic cancer survival.

<h4>Microbiome</h4>
<p>Paired non-malignant and tumor tissues from gastric cancer patients from China and Mexico were used to characterize the taxonomic and derived functional profiles of gastric microbiota, and compare them with microbial profiles in other body sites using the Human Microbiome Project. <em>Heliobacter pylori</em> (<em>Hp</em>) was the most abundant member of gastric microbiota in both Chinese and Mexican samples (51 and 24 percent, respectively), followed by oral-associated bacteria. Taxonomic (phylum-level) profiles of stomach microbiota resembled oral microbiota, especially when the <em>Helicobacter</em> reads were removed. The functional profiles of stomach microbiota, however, were distinct from those found in other body sites and had higher inter-subject dissimilarity. Gastric microbiota composition did not differ by <em>Hp</em> colonization status or stomach anatomic sites, but did differ between paired non-malignant and tumor tissues in either Chinese or Mexican samples.

<h4>Radiation Exposure</h4>
<p>To evaluate risk of thyroid neoplasia nearly 30 years following exposure to radioactive iodine (I-131) from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident, researchers conducted a fifth cycle of thyroid screening of the Ukrainian-American cohort during 2012-2015; the first screening cycle started in 1998. A significant dose response between I-131 exposure and risk of both thyroid cancer and follicular adenoma was observed. This excess risk of malignant and benign thyroid neoplasia, which has persisted nearly three decades after exposure, underscores the importance of continued follow-up of this cohort to characterize long-term pattern of I-131 risk.

<h4>Low-intensity Cigarette Smoking</h4>
<p>An increasing proportion of U.S. smokers smoke &le;10 cigarettes per day (CPD) or do not smoke every day, yet the health effects of low-intensity smoking are poorly understood. Using data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, current smokers who reported consistently smoking 1-10 CPD over their lifetime were 2.3 times more likely to develop smoking-related cancer, relative to never smokers, mostly due to excess lung, bladder, and pancreatic cancer. Current lifetime smokers of &lt;1 CPD were almost two times more likely to develop tobacco-related cancer, although the association did not reach statistical significance. Among lifelong &le;10 CPD smokers, former smokers had lower risks of smoking-related cancer with longer time since cessation.

<p>Senior genetic counselor June Peters, M.S., C.G.C., L.M.F.T., was the third recruit to the newly-created <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=42&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302430" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7269899" sys_dependentid="302430" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="302430">Clinical Genetics Branch</a> (CGB) in the summer of 2000. During the subsequent 17&nbsp;years, she was a critical part of the leadership team that shaped the growth, direction, and productivity of the newest and most clinically-focused branch in DCEG. Her primary responsibility was to counsel and support the patients enrolled in CGB clinical research studies. These individuals and families live with inherited cancer predisposition syndromes, or related diagnoses, that considerably increase their risk of cancer. Ms. Peters&rsquo;s dedication to patient quality of life and well-being has served as the motivating force behind many of her most significant research contributions.</p>
<p>Ms. Peters&rsquo;s research explored the dynamic personal, family, and social implications of hereditary cancers and gene-environment interactions focusing on biological mechanisms&mdash;such as inflammation and telomere biology&mdash;that interact with psychological and social well-being and health. As part of the CGB clinic team, she sought to incorporate integrative medicine, mind-body healing, and mindfulness-based stress reduction to the clinic. Despite her extensive clinical responsibilities, Ms. Peters found time to publish more than 65 peer-reviewed articles in the scientific literature, which comprise a significant portion of her clinical research legacy. In branch meetings and hallway conversations, she served as conscience to the branch staff, always turning the conversation back to the needs of the individual patient, and the over-arching responsibility to improve their quality of life and survival.</p>
<p>Ms.&nbsp;Peters&nbsp;and sociologist collaborator Regina Kenen conceived and introduced the Colored Eco-Genetic Relationship Map (CEGRM), a novel counseling tool that facilitated quickly capturing valuable information regarding multiple emotional, social and psychological domains in these patients&rsquo; complex lives, permitting assessment of their interpersonal needs and social exchanges. They used the CEGRM when assessing high-risk families in each of the hereditary&nbsp;in each of the hereditary syndromes CGB was studying, and, in collaborations with investigators at the National Human Genome Research Institute, extending these observations into their social networks.</p>
<p>Within the CGB study of Li-Fraumeni Syndrome patients, Ms. Peters discovered that despite the nearly 100% lifetime risk of developing cancer among those with germline <em>TP53</em> mutations, these individuals and families have constructed robust social and spiritual support systems and remain remarkably positive in their outlook and thinking.</p>
<p>Over her four-decade career, Ms. Peters has held a wide variety of genetic counseling and academic positions in tertiary care medical centers, universities, private community hospitals, county, state and federal government. She is board-certified by both the American Board of Genetic Counseling and the American Board of Medical Genetics, and is a founding member of both the National Society of Genetic Counselors, and the American College of Medical Genetics. Ms. Peters is also a Marriage and Family Therapist, licensed in California and the District of Columbia. She received an M.S. degree in genetic counseling in 1973 from Rutgers University and an M.S. in psychological counseling in 1986 from California State University at San Bernardino. Her unique style and perspective will be greatly missed by CGB and DCEG staff, and by the national and international genetic counseling communities.</p>

<p>A large genomic analysis of human papillomavirus (HPV) shines new light on the influence of viral genetic diversity on carcinogenicity of the high-risk type HPV 16. Investigators in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, National Cancer Institute, led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=639592" sys_contentid="639592" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="639592" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7278084">Lisa Mirabello, Ph.D., M.S.</a>, and collaborators, observed that a particular genetic sequence of the <em>E7</em> oncogene is common to virtually all cervical cancers caused by HPV 16 worldwide. The study was published online in the journal <em>Cell</em> on September 7, 2017.</p>
<p>HPV 16 causes about half of all cervical cancer cases worldwide. Most infections clear on their own, but the few that persist can cause precancer, which could ultimately develop into cancer. It is not known why these common and typically benign HPV 16 infections only sometimes cause cancer. Prior studies by DCEG scientists and others have shown that HPV 16 can be divided into ten sublineages that confer strong differences in risk of precancer and cancer, but the team hoped that even finer distinctions could lead to a greater understanding of the molecular mechanisms of viral carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>The researchers first examined genetic diversity of HPV 16 found in samples taken from women in four studies. A surprisingly low percentage of distinct viral genomes, or isolates, were identified in more than one woman, about 15-25 percent depending on the cohort, suggesting a much greater viral genetic diversity <em>between</em> women than was previously thought. Conversely, viral diversity was low <em>within</em> individuals at multiple HPV 16-positive body sites: in evaluating cervical samples paired with oral, anal, or vulvar samples, 82 percent of the HPV 16 genomes sequenced were the same at both sites.</p>
<p>When they compared the HPV 16 genome sequences of the cases and controls, they discovered that the controls, the benign infections, had significantly more protein-changing variants throughout the genome. In particular, samples taken from cervical cancer cases around the world were devoid of protein-changing variants in the <em>E7</em> oncogene, compared to higher levels in the controls. Further study of the <em>E7</em> region revealed that the majority of these rare variants observed in the controls were potentially due to the activity of human APOBEC3 cytidine deaminases, DNA editing enzymes that are thought to be part of the innate immune system and have antiviral effects. In stark contrast, variation in the other major HPV 16 oncogene, E6, was not significantly different between cases and controls. Furthermore, <em>E6</em> had more protein-changing variants than <em>E7</em> in the cancer cases. These results suggest that the uniquely potent carcinogenicity of HPV 16 hinges on the conservation of the E7 protein.</p>

<p>William Anderson, M.D., M.P.H., retired from Federal service in September 2017 after nearly 20 years as a cancer surveillance researcher. His efforts to develop sophisticated biostatistical methods, with a focus on breast cancer, have led to important advances in risk modeling and understanding of cancer trends.</p>
<p>Dr. Anderson received his medical, clinical, and epidemiological training at Tulane University, and began his career in public health as a community-based hematologist and medical oncologist in rural northeast Louisiana. While a practicing physician, Dr. Anderson became fascinated with his observation that breast cancer outcomes in his patients were more heterogeneous than expected. Eventually he was able to address this clinical mystery&mdash;and its implications&mdash;as an investigator at DCEG. After practicing for two decades, he headed north for a Cancer Prevention Fellowship at NCI, later becoming a medical officer in the Division of Cancer Prevention. Dr. Anderson&rsquo;s work at DCEG commenced in 2005, when he joined the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=41&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302568" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302568" sys_relationshipid="7259178" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="302568">Biostatistics Branch</a> (BB) as a tenure-track investigator. He was promoted to senior investigator in 2012.</p>
<p>While a major goal of Dr. Anderson&rsquo;s research was to clarify breast cancer heterogeneity, his work contributed to a better understanding of trends and etiology for several cancer types. Proving himself adept at bringing together interdisciplinary scientists to tackle diverse questions, Dr. Anderson developed a highly collaborative research program over his time at DCEG. Ranging as far as Denmark (several investigators at the Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group) and as close as the adjacent office at NCI (<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=31&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349627" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349627" sys_relationshipid="7259179" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349627">Ruth Pfeiffer, Ph.D.</a>, also a senior investigator in BB), these collaborations have resulted in a series of landmark cancer surveillance studies of breast cancer, oral cancer, non-cardia gastric cancer, and colorectal cancer.</p>
<p><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=19&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1057578" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1057578" sys_relationshipid="7259180" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="1057578">Paul Albert, Ph.D.</a>, Chief of BB, noted, &ldquo;Dr. Anderson has played a central role in the descriptive epidemiology research agenda within the branch and in the Division. Although not a biostatistician by training, Dr. Anderson has made important contributions to the development and implementation of new statistical methodology for understanding cancer trends and in risk modeling. His clinical perspective on all issues has brought an added richness to our research in BB. His intellectual rigor, high energy, collaborative spirit, and kind nature will very much be missed in the BB.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349657" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349657" sys_relationshipid="7259181" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349657">Philip Rosenberg, Ph.D.</a>, an early mentor and long-time collaborator, Dr. Anderson developed an array of statistical models and tools to study cancer trends and predict risk. They have been instrumental in the increasing popularity of age-period-cohort models, sophisticated analyses that allow scientists to track cancer incidence and mortality trends in great detail, yielding insight into the disparate factors underlying these patterns. Said Dr. Rosenberg, &ldquo;Bill is one of the very few cancer surveillance researchers in the world who are able to combine novel statistical methodology with intimate knowledge of cancer surveillance and genuine clinical insight. I believe&nbsp;he has shown us the future of descriptive epidemiology. It has been a career highlight and privilege to work with Bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Throughout his career, mentoring and teaching were central to Dr. Anderson&rsquo;s work. Having held faculty positions at the Tulane University School of Medicine, the George Washington University School of Medicine, and the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, he has been passionate about training the next generation of public health workers.</p>
<p>Dr. Anderson has served on the editorial boards of several journals, including <em>Breast Cancer Research and Treatment</em>, the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em>, <em>Cancer Epidemiology</em>, <em>Biomarkers &amp; Prevention</em>, and <em>The Breast Journal</em>.</p>

<p>In September 2017, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/beane-freeman-laura">Laura Beane Freeman, Ph.D.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH and promoted to senior investigator in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch. Dr. Beane Freeman has made important contributions to our understanding of the carcinogenicity of pesticide exposures, formaldehyde, and drinking water contaminants. Her work has been heavily cited by regulatory and review agencies worldwide.</p>
<p>Dr. Beane Freeman leads the landmark <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cohorts/agricultural-health-study">Agricultural Health Study</a> (AHS), a prospective cohort study of farmers and their spouses, with detailed information on pesticide and other agricultural exposures. Her research program is focused on evaluating agricultural exposures that may be related to cancer and other health outcomes. She provides strategic leadership and oversight for the overall study, and mentors junior scientists who use data from the AHS.</p>
<p>She is also the principal investigator of the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/what-we-study/dceg-research-formaldehyde-exposure">NCI Formaldehyde Industrial Cohort</a>, the largest study of formaldehyde-exposed workers in the world. Her findings linking formaldehyde exposure to myeloid leukemia continue to play a key role in ongoing national and international regulatory decisions.</p>
<p>In the area of drinking water contaminants, Dr. Beane Freeman recently led an evaluation in a case-control study of bladder cancer risk based on one of the most comprehensive exposure assessment of disinfection by-products to date. Her work provided additional evidence supporting an association between total trihalomethane ingestion and bladder cancer.&nbsp;</p></div>]]></body>

Dr. Freedman was a key leader in several analyses exploring potential inverse relationships between cancer and neurodegenerative diseases using SEER-Medicare data. She also developed a novel approach to use data from Medicare Part D to explore links between cancer risk and commonly used medications. In addition, Dr. Freedman served as chair of the Technical Evaluation of Questionnaires committee for 10 years, and helped numerous investigators improve their questionnaires.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As the only DCEG investigator with extensive work experience in epidemiology and law, Dr. Freedman contributed rigorous assessment, creative solutions, and an impressive ability to clearly articulate all aspects of her research,&rdquo; commented Dr. Martha Linet, senior investigator and former Chief of REB. &ldquo;Her vision was one of the driving forces in reinvigorating DCEG research on ultraviolet radiation and etiology of non-melanoma skin cancer, from field work to the identification of new data sources and incisive analysis.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In September, Catherine B. McClave, M.S., retired after 44 years of government service. For the past two decades, Ms. McClave has supported the senior leadership of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). In her most recent role as Senior Advisor for Division Operations, she provided scientific and administrative leadership for scientific reporting, strategic planning, and budget formulation for DCEG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Throughout her tenure at DCEG, Cathy has been instrumental in directing the Division&rsquo;s complex operations, from scientific reporting to budget,&rdquo; said Division Director <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/chanock-stephen">Stephen J. Chanock, M.D.</a> &ldquo;She has provided expert support to nearly every Branch and investigator, and her efforts will be sorely missed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. McClave began her career at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in the Laboratory of Biochemistry, then transferred to the Office of Research Services, Office of the Director, NIH.&nbsp;She later returned to NCI as part of the Administrative Career Development Program, joining the NCI Budget Office at the completion of the program.&nbsp;From there, she transferred to the Office of the Director within the NCI Division of Cancer Etiology.&nbsp;She made her final move to the Office of the Director within DCEG shortly after NCI established the Division in 1995, joining her mentor Dr. Susan Sieber, who became the first Deputy Director of DCEG.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When Dr. Sieber eventually left the Division, she remarked that one of the best things she had done for DCEG was to bring Cathy with her,&rdquo; said <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/zahm-shelia">Shelia Zahm, Sc.D</a>., Scientific Advisor. &ldquo;I remember her words to this day, because they indeed predicted Cathy&rsquo;s remarkable contributions to the Division. She has been an incredible source of wisdom, organization, writing, editing, and management in support of the Division&rsquo;s scientific and administrative activities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Ms. McClave served as the Division liaison to the NCI Institute Review Office for site visit coordination and other activities involving the NCI Board of Scientific Counselors and the National Cancer Advisory Board. She was the Executive Secretary for the DCEG Promotion and Tenure Review Panel and the Technical Evaluation of Protocols Committee, and managed the formal process for the promotion of DCEG tenure-track investigators to NIH tenure. She was responsible for preparation of the Division&rsquo;s scientific narratives for the Congressional Budget Justification and programmatic responses to inquiries from NIH, PHS, DHHS, Congress, other federal agencies, and the public.</p>
<p>Ms. McClave oversaw Division communications activities and content preparation for the Division newsletter, as well as responses to Freedom of Information Act inquiries, review of intramural/extramural letters of collaboration, official duty and outside activity inquiries, and the appointment process for the Special Studies Institutional Review Board.</p>
<p>Ms. McClave is the former Chief of the DCEG Office of Communications and Special Initiatives, a position she held from 2008-2015. She has received two NIH Merit Group Awards: one in 1998, for upgrading the DCEG database of intramural research projects, and one in 2011, for exceptional scientific reporting and communications activities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cathy came to DCEG at a critical time just as we attained Division status as a major component of the intramural research program at NCI and NIH,&rdquo; said founding DCEG Director <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/fraumeni-joseph">Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.</a> &ldquo;We were immediately confronted with a series of challenges in managing an expanding scientific portfolio.&nbsp;We came to depend on Cathy for her remarkable ability to see the big picture and take care of every little detail.&nbsp;There was never a deadline that she didn&rsquo;t meet or a project that wasn&rsquo;t done to perfection.&nbsp;She has been an indispensable leader in the Division, as well as a terrific colleague and friend to all of us.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the majority of cancers, the likely precursors rarely go on to become malignant, or occur in tissues in the body that are less amenable to treatment, making it hard to develop cost-effective prevention strategies that balance risk reduction with unnecessary medical intervention. Such is the case for an increasingly common condition, known as Barrett&rsquo;s esophagus (BE), which may evolve into esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA).</p>
<p>EA is the malignant endpoint of the continuum of disease which may initiate with severe gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition thought to cause erosion of the lining of the esophagus. In the case of BE, the body sometimes mistakenly re-lines the esophagus with tissue similar to the lining of the intestine. This metaplastic tissue change is named for an Australian-born surgeon named <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4391409/">Norman Rupert Barrett, who published his observations in 1950</a>, though others noticed the pattern before him.</p>
<p>Interest in BE arose out of the investigation of alarmingly high annual increases in the rate of EA in the United States. Diagnosis with BE increases a patient&rsquo;s risk of EA up to 10&ndash;30 times that of the general population. Although still a relatively rare cancer, EA incidence has gone up more than 600 percent in the United States since 1973, from 0.36/100,000 to 2.68/100,000 per year in 2014. In 1997, adenocarcinoma surpassed squamous cell carcinoma as the predominant type of esophageal cancer in the United States. The two cancers are histologically distinct, with differing etiologies.</p>
<p><a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/cook-michael-b">Michael Cook, Ph.D.</a>, of the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB), leads investigations of EA and BE with an aim to clarify etiologic factors and improve risk prediction. According to Dr. Cook, there are two main clinical questions in this research field: Can we develop a cost-effective means to identify and risk triage patients with BE so they can be clinically managed with precision? And, is there a biomarker that could serve as a low cost, highly sensitive test to diagnose EA?&nbsp;</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin: 0 5px 10px 30px;">
<p>Dr. Cook uses both classical and molecular epidemiology in cross-sectional, case-control, and prospective studies to describe pathogenesis and identify biomarkers.</p>
</div>
<p>This work is rife with complex epidemiological and methodological challenges. Some of the known and potential risk factors are linked, making it difficult to tease apart their various contributions and elucidate putative biological mechanisms. For instance, GERD and obesity&mdash;particularly abdominal obesity&mdash;have been identified as risk factors for both BE and EA, and, although obesity increases risk for GERD, it also likely confers risk for BE and EA via systemic inflammation and metabolic syndrome. Second, for reasons yet unknown, EA has one of the highest male-to-female sex ratios of any malignancy: between five and eight men develop EA for every woman diagnosed. Third, the rate of progression from BE to EA is fairly low: about one case for every 400 person-years of follow-up, which makes prospective studies of the carcinogenic process difficult. Lastly, according to an analysis of data from the NCI SEER program and the National Program of Cancer Registries by Dr. Cook and colleagues, there is marked racial and geographic variability within the United States.</p>
<p>Seeking to tackle these problems, Dr. Cook uses both classical and molecular epidemiology in cross-sectional, case-control, and prospective studies to describe pathogenesis and identify biomarkers. If there were an effective method to discern patients at low- or high-risk of progression to EA, interventions such as ablation/endoscopic surgery aimed at removing the affected tissue and surveillance (e.g., periodic endoscopy) could be targeted to individuals with the highest risks, likely resulting in a reduction in the number of cases presenting with large or late-stage malignancies, which are rapidly fatal.</p>
<p>To compile a sufficient number of cases for study, Dr. Cook collaborates with the <a href="http://beacon.tlvnet.net/">International Barrett&rsquo;s and Esophageal Adenocarcinoma Consortium</a> (BEACON), composed of over three dozen investigators with completed or ongoing epidemiologic studies of BE and/or EA. Using this resource, Dr. Cook has provided evidence that obesity&mdash;which traditionally had been hypothesized to have a direct mechanical effect on risk of EA by interfering with the gastroesophageal sphincter&mdash;likely exerts indirect, non-mechanical effects. Obesity is known to wreak havoc on various metabolic pathways&mdash;including the production and metabolism of sex steroid hormones and inflammatory cytokines&mdash;and related health conditions, like metabolic syndrome and diabetes. To build on this evidence base, Dr. Cook and colleagues are engaging the full range of next-generation technologies to compare metabolic patterns to tease apart the various contributing factors.</p>

<p>Dr. Cook has led and designed an <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/cohort.html">NCI Cohort Consortium</a> project utilizing data from seven prospective studies for a total of 300 EA cases and an equal number of controls. In collaboration with the laboratory of Dr. Ligia Pinto at NCI Frederick, the research team has tested 70 markers of inflammation and immune response&mdash;including several adipocytokines&mdash;using prediagnostic serum.</p>
<p>Findings from this study identify nine markers associated with future risk of EA&mdash;in particular, soluble TNF receptor II. This association did not change with increased time between blood draw and diagnosis, increasing the likelihood that EA itself need not be present to observe the association. Importantly, level of excess body fat only had slight attenuating effects on these relationships. This suggests that the relationships between these circulating biomarkers and cancer risk are not mediated by obesity and highlights the importance of a heightened systemic inflammation in the etiology of EA. Work is ongoing to determine whether a panel of these circulating immune-inflammation markers can assist with triaging of patients at high risk for EA.</p>
<p>Identification of such a high-risk population is currently difficult due to the fact that less than 10 percent of EA cases have a preceding diagnosis of BE. Dr. Cook has used cutting-edge platforms to search for a tissue microRNA signature that distinguishes BE with high sensitivity and high specificity from normal subjects without BE. For example, he&nbsp;is now using&nbsp;this BE tissue microRNA signature in collaboration with Dr. Rebecca Fitzgerald at the University of Cambridge, England. Dr. Fitzgerald has designed and implemented the Cytosponge&mdash;a low-cost esophageal sampling device in which patients swallow a capsule containing a sponge. Once in contact with gastric acid in the stomach, the sponge expands and is then pulled up through the esophagus, collecting cells on its way. Together, the researchers have been&nbsp;able to detect microRNAs from their BE tissue microRNA signature in these Cytosponge samples, which provided extremely high sensitivity and specificity for BE. This evidence is a critical step toward the utilization of the Cytosponge to diagnose BE.</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin: 0 5px 10px 30px;">
<p>&ldquo;With smart design of human epidemiologic studies, we can quickly discover and implement molecular signatures of precancers that further the central tenets of Precision Medicine.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Work is ongoing to determine whether circulating immune-inflammation markers or microRNAs can assist with risk-triaging of patients at high risk for EA. Since microRNAs can be actively and passively exported by cells into the blood, Dr. Cook is also assessing whether tissue microRNA signatures are detectable in blood, possibly paving the way for a cheap, minimally-invasive EA diagnostic test.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is a big leap of faith, and a much more high-risk project, but we are starting with a small pilot,&rdquo; said Dr. Cook. Early results using HTG EdgeSeq appear promising: two tissue microRNAs provided significant distinction between cancer cases and controls when measured in blood.</p>
<p><strong>Next steps: Building the next study population</strong></p>
<p>Dr. Cook is a big advocate of prospective studies. &ldquo;We cannot reconstruct the natural history of a disease with data from stage-specific, cross-sectional studies; and rare cancers are no exception,&rdquo; he said. To address this gap, he is assessing the feasibility of a multi-institutional, retrospective case-control study of BE to discover tissue biomarkers associated with progression to EA.</p>
<p>Dr. Cook imagines a future that maximizes the potential of precancerous states. &ldquo;With smart design of human epidemiologic studies, we can quickly discover and implement molecular signatures of precancers that further the central tenets of Precision Medicine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>DCEG investigators are coordinating with the <a href="https://www.cprd.com/home/">Clinical Practice Research Datalink</a> (CPRD) to access observational data for millions of patients in clinics across the United Kingdom (UK). The CPRD is the world&rsquo;s largest database of anonymized, longitudinal primary care medical records; it collects data from over 850 general practices, with historical data on over 22 million patients. Early validation studies showed that the clinics included in the database constituted a broadly representative sample of general practices across the UK.<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"></span></p>
<p>&ldquo;The CPRD is a rich resource for cancer epidemiology research,&rdquo; said <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/gadalla-shahinaz">Shahinaz Gadalla, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, investigator in the Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB), who is leading DCEG efforts to access and utilize the database. As a governmental, not-for-profit research service, the CPRD is jointly funded by the UK&rsquo;s National Health Service (NHS) National Institute for Health Research and the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. The database contains patient demographics and lifestyle factors (e.g., smoking and alcohol consumption), clinical diagnoses, test results, immunization and cancer screening records, and full prescription data.</p>
<p>The CPRD primary care records are <a href="https://www.cprd.com/recordLinkage/">linkable to other resources</a> such as cancer and death registries, and hospital admissions data. Essentially, the CPRD mimics a prospective cohort study, without the need for recruitment and retention of participants, and without the typically long interval between recruitment and ascertainment of cancers. This can be said about other electronic medical databases, but the CPRD is unique in that the UK primary care physicians are the gatekeepers of patient medical care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through primary care records, we can see the full spectrum of a disease or exposure,&rdquo; Dr. Gadalla said. &ldquo;In my work, using CPRD allowed me to capture the full age range of patients with myotonic dystrophy, rather than just the more severe subset we normally identify when using hospital records.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Another advantage to the CPRD &ndash; there is a new release of data every month. &ldquo;For example, data extracted in 2016 is current up to the time of the download,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very dynamic and detailed, compared to other resources.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Tapping into a valuable resource</h3>
<p>For the past three years, Dr. Gadalla has worked with the CPRD research group, DCEG investigators, the NCI Office of Acquisitions, and the NCI Technology Transfer Center to ensure DCEG investigators have access to the data. &ldquo;The first year was devoted to building the infrastructure, understanding the data, and putting the contractual agreement in place,&rdquo; said Dr. Gadalla. &ldquo;Now that we&rsquo;re a few years out, I think the process for investigators is smooth.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin: 0 5px 10px 30px;">
<p>"The CPRD is a rich resource for cancer epidemiology research."</p>
</div>
<p>Dr. Gadalla leads the DCEG CPRD users&rsquo; committee, which meets regularly to discuss new proposals, address questions, and develop a repository of Read codes (the UK NHS standard scheme for describing the care and treatment of patients). Read codes allow for more specifications and detail than <span>International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes</span>, says Dr. Gadalla. &ldquo;Coding can get complex and interesting, so the code repository is a valuable resource.&rdquo; In addition, several DCEG CPRD data users and committee members devoted time to develop common algorithms to extract covariates like smoking, BMI, and alcohol use; these algorithms are currently used for all projects.</p>
<p>A number of studies are underway utilizing the CPRD data. In CGB, Dr. Gadalla is investigating benign and malignant tumors among patients with myotonic dystrophy; itraconazole (<span>a drug used to treat fungal infections</span>) and risk of cancer; and nitrates 5-alpha-reductase and hormone replacement therapy in relation to risk of upper gastrointestinal cancer (in collaboration with <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/Camargo-Maria">Maria Constanza Camargo, Ph.D.</a>, Metabolic Epidemiology Branch, and Dr. Christopher Cardwell, Queen&rsquo;s University Belfast). <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/wentzensen-nicolas">Nicolas Wentzensen, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, Deputy Chief of CGB, is exploring prescription medications for cardiovascular disease and metabolic syndrome in relation to endometrial/ovarian cancer.</p>

<p><a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/cook-michael-b">Michael B. Cook, Ph.D.</a>, in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB), is exploring reproductive risk factors for prostate cancer incidence, mortality, and survival; and hormone therapy in relation to risks of second cancers and mortality among women and men. <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/mcglynn-katherine">Katherine A. McGlynn, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, also in MEB, is investigating liver cancer and domperidone use; and oophorectomy and risk of primary liver cancer and fatty liver disease.</p>
<p>From the Biostatistics Branch, postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/bb-fellows#Best">Ana Best, Ph.D.</a>, used the database to test a statistical method of combining prevalent and incident cohort data in estimating survivor function.</p>
<h3>New avenues and next steps</h3>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin: 0 5px 10px 30px;">
<p>"I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from the administrative perspective of leading this large effort, and I&rsquo;m pleased that this work has contributed to a number of new collaborations within DCEG and beyond."</p>
</div>
<p>The sheer wealth of data in the CPRD allows investigators to venture into new areas of study. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve started some work in pharmacoepidemiology,&rdquo; Dr. Gadalla said. &ldquo;This field is rich and very important for cancer research. There is a lot to learn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Gadalla will host a seminar later this year to highlight a few DCEG studies that are using these data. In the meantime, investigators continue to move forward on several publications and to build collaborations to fully utilize this resource.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s been an amazing experience,&rdquo; Dr. Gadalla said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve learned a lot from the administrative perspective of leading this large effort, and I&rsquo;m pleased that this work has contributed to a number of new collaborations within DCEG and beyond. I&rsquo;m trying to encourage more fellows to use it, as it is such a nice resource for them. It&rsquo;s exciting to see what is on the horizon.&rdquo;</p>

<p><em>by Kristin Kiser, M.H.A., M.S.</em></p>
<p>This year, DCEG had the pleasure of hosting 35 summer interns. The interns ranged from high school through graduate school-level and hailed from such diverse locations as North Carolina, Florida, New York state, Nevada, Missouri, and Washington state.</p>
<p>As in recent years, DCEG participated in NIH specialty programs that target students from backgrounds typically under-represented in science, with the goal of increasing their participation in biomedical research. This year we welcomed seven interns from the following programs: <a href="https://icrc.nci.nih.gov/">NCI Introduction to Cancer Research Careers</a>, <a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/gsoar_home_page">NIH Graduate Summer Opportunity to Advance Research</a>, and the NIH Community College Summer Enrichment Program. In addition, the DCEG Office of Education (OE) sponsored one intern whose summer research focused on health disparities.</p>

<p>Mentoring is a highly valued skill in DCEG, so before the summer interns began to arrive in mid-May, Kristin Kiser, M.H.A., M.S., fellowship coordinator for the DCEG OE, offered training to DCEG summer mentors to discuss program specifics and tips for making the summer experience successful. Mentors were also invited to attend the comprehensive workshop, Mentoring Relationships: Understanding, Developing and Making the Most of Them, co-led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349643" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349643" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7253817" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349643">Jackie Lavigne, Ph.D.</a>, Chief, OE, DCEG and <a href="https://www.nigms.nih.gov/about/Pages/Faupel-Badger.aspx">Jessica Faupel-Badger, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, Program Director and Director, Postdoctoral Research Associate Program, National Institute of General Medical Sciences.</p>
<h3>Workshops Help Interns Develop Career Skills</h3>
<p>Several new workshops were offered for the summer interns this year. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=88&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1033198#Michels" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1033198" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7253820" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1033198#michels">Kara Michels, Ph.D.</a>, postdoctoral fellow in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch, hosted two training sessions at NCI Shady Grove, which she developed based on her experience with previous summer interns. The first was an Introduction to using PubMed and Endnote, which provided the basics for conducting literature searches and managing research references. During this hands-on workshop, students were guided by <a href="https://nihlibrary.nih.gov/about-us/staff-directory/brian-brown">Brian Brown, M.L.I.S., C.U.A.</a>, an NIH Library user experience librarian.</p>

The aim of this workshop was to address career questions such as: &ldquo;Should I pursue a career in research? How do I integrate research into a clinical career? How do I decide between health policy or epidemiology?&rdquo; Postdoctoral fellows from DCEG and the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences talked about their academic and professional journeys that led to their current positions.</p>
<p>Victoria Fisher, M.P.H., and Cora Hersh, of the&nbsp;DCEG Communications Team, along with Diane Wigfield, program analyst in OE, developed and led four workshops:</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>In the first study of its kind, an international team of genomics researchers has identified new regions of the human genome that are associated with skin color variation in some African populations, opening new avenues for research on skin diseases and cancer in all populations. These findings may help researchers determine if humans with certain DNA sequences are more or less susceptible to DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation (UVR) or respond to cellular stress differently. National Institutes of Health researchers, including several from DCEG,&nbsp;contributed to this effort, led by Sarah Tishkoff, Ph.D., at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. The findings were published October 12, 2017, in the journal <em>Science</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Studying human skin pigmentation helps researchers understand how the cells that produce skin pigment&mdash;melanocytes&mdash;and genes work together to protect skin from the damaging effects of UVR. Because equatorial regions receive approximately two times more UVR than more temperate regions, darker pigmentation in people from these regions is thought to reduce skin damage and cancer. In contrast, lighter pigmentation of people in northern countries may increase the production of vitamin D3 needed to prevent rickets, a softening and weakening of bones in children, usually due to inadequate vitamin D.</p>

<p>An international team of scientists, known collectively as the OncoArray Network, have identified an additional 72 common inherited variants associated with risk for breast cancer, 10 of which were identified by analyses of estrogen-receptor negative disease and <em>BRCA1</em> mutation carriers who have strong susceptibility to develop triple negative breast cancer. In all, these findings, published in <em>Nature</em> and <em>Nature Genetics</em> on October 23, 2017, nearly double the number of known risk variants for breast cancer, clearing the way for improved genetic risk models to help clinicians advise women on appropriate prevention strategies.</p>
<p>The OncoArray Network, an international genotyping project, comprises hundreds of research institutions, including the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. By pooling studies from around the world, the OncoArray Network amassed study populations sufficiently large to detect small effects from scores of common variants through genome-wide association studies&mdash;over 256,000 women and over 140,000 women for the <em>Nature</em> and <em>Nature&nbsp;Genetics</em> papers,&nbsp;respectively.</p>

<p>In November 2017, the Oxford University Press published the fourth edition of Cancer Epidemiology and Prevention edited by Michael Thun, M.D, M.S. (lead editor) and DCEG senior investigator <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349666" sys_contentid="349666" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349666" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276474">Martha Linet, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, James Cerhan, M.D., Ph.D., Christopher Haiman, Sc.D., and David Schottenfeld, M.D., M.Sc. (co-editors).</p>
<p>The new edition of this authoritative textbook features in-depth updates on cancer incidence, mortality, and survival trends; known and suspected causes of cancer; comprehensive assessment of the epidemiology of specific cancer outcomes; and implications of the rapidly growing knowledge about etiology for cancer prevention. An international group of nearly 200 authors contributed to 63 chapters during the two-year production process, including more than 40 current or former DCEG staff.</p>
<p>The textbook clearly describes the expansion of knowledge since the year 2000, and current research on cancer types and exposures. In addition to comprehensive chapters on 35 cancer outcomes, the book features a notable expansion on cancer prevention. The content also includes chapters on basic biology, molecular biomarkers, tumor genomics, genetic modifiers of environmental risks, social class disparities in incidence and mortality, obesity, physical activity, immunologic factors, endogenous and exogenous hormones, chemoprevention, electromagnetic fields, and radiofrequency radiation.</p>
<p>An important feature of this edition is the attention given to future directions in many areas of cancer research. For instance, the authors discuss the increasingly collaborative nature of science that comes with ever-more complex studies and datasets. They suggest areas, such as hormonal carcinogenesis, in which this interdisciplinarity might help uncover clues to cancer etiology. The authors also note the growing need for cancer survivorship research as the number of people who survive cancer continues to swell. Development of risk prediction models and studies of the microbiome are other areas that are highlighted in the new edition as crucial areas for future development.&nbsp;In addition, the authors emphasize epidemiologic strategies that are primed to have major impact on research, such as development of new cohorts, improved methods for exposure assessment, identification of new data sources to link more complete and accurate information about exposures and cancer outcomes, and collection of many types of biological samples and tumor tissue to evaluate biomarkers of exposure and effect and mechanisms of carcinogenesis.</p>

<p>Drug overdose deaths are a major public health concern across all racial/ethnic groups, and are often associated with opioid use. However, a new study shows that cocaine is also a consistent contributor to overdose deaths. The research suggests that rates of cocaine-related overdose deaths in the non-Hispanic black population are similar to heroin-related deaths among non-Hispanic white women and prescription opioid-related deaths among non-Hispanic white men. The study was conducted by researchers at the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the National Cancer Institute, both part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>The authors suggest that although strategies to address prescription opioid and heroin overdoses remain critical for all racial/ethnic groups, prevention efforts focused on reducing cocaine-related deaths among the non-Hispanic black population are also needed.</p>

Dr. Purdue investigates cancer risk associated with occupational exposures, circulating immune markers as they relate to risk for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and multiple myeloma, and genetic susceptibility to renal cell carcinoma. His extensive portfolio in these areas has advanced the field and made significant contributions to public health and worker safety.</p>
<p>Dr. Purdue applies a wide range of classic and molecular epidemiologic methods to enhance exposure assessment and elucidate mechanisms underlying the development of cancer. In particular, he is an expert on the carcinogenicity of the chlorinated solvent trichloroethylene (TCE), reporting associations between cumulative exposure to TCE and increasing risk for NHL and renal cell cancer. These findings inform regulatory and review agencies worldwide, including the National Toxicology Program and the International Agency for Research on Cancer.</p>
<p>In the arena of molecular epidemiology, Dr. Purdue leads cohort-based investigations of circulating immune and other biomarkers in cancer risk. In a series of cutting-edge studies, he found an association between pre-diagnostic serum biomarkers and risk for NHL. He has extended his work on circulating biomarkers to a related cancer, multiple myeloma, and reported key insights into the etiology of this lethal lymphoid malignancy.</p>
<p>Dr. Purdue was the first to conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of renal cell cancer; most recently expanding his research to meta-analyses that resulted in the identification of seven additional regions, doubling the number of susceptibility loci identified to date.</p>

<p>A study from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) offers new evidence that individualized lung cancer risk-based screening may be more effective at preventing lung cancer deaths than current U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening criteria.</p>
<p>The USPSTF recommends annual low-dose computed tomography (CT) screening for individuals aged 55 to 80 who have a history of heavy smoking (at least one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years or more) and who currently smoke or have quit within the last 15 years. However, these criteria may exclude some smokers who would be considered at high risk for lung cancer based on individual risk estimates that more specifically account for demographic, clinical, and smoking behaviors<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>A previous analysis showed that the USPSTF criteria identified fewer ever-smokers for lung cancer screening in 2015, compared to 2010. Li Cheung, Ph.D., and colleagues decided to investigate the reasons fewer individuals were assigned to screening, and to determine the impact of that shift on lung cancer death. In addition, they examined whether a validated risk-based model using fixed risk thresholds would have similar declines in the number of ever-smokers eligible for screening and the number of lung cancer deaths prevented.</p>
<p>The investigators report that, due to changing smoking behaviors in the U.S. population between 2010 and 2015, the use of USPSTF criteria could result in the identification of 1.5 million fewer ever-smokers eligible for CT screening and 8,000 fewer lung cancer deaths averted in 2015 compared to 2010. When investigators evaluated the ever-smoker population using individual risk-based criteria, they found more modest declines in the numbers screened and deaths averted in 2015 compared to 2010.</p>
<p>This gap in screening effectiveness between risk-based and USPSTF screening criteria has widened substantially in recent years and may continue to expand as smoking prevalence and intensity decrease among young people in the U.S. To better capture high-risk smokers and prevent premature deaths from lung cancer, eligibility for screening should be based on a risk threshold that balances benefits, costs, and harms.</p>

                              <p>A recent study found that the incidence of noncardia gastric cancers&mdash;those occurring in the antrum and pylorus&mdash;has been increasing for Americans under age 50.</p>                                        </div>

<p>In&nbsp;January 2018, a team of DCEG investigators published an updated analysis of U.S. cancer incidence in the lower part of the stomach&mdash;known as noncardia gastric cancer. Despite an overall downward trend at the population level, they showed a distinct split in rates across generations.</p>
<p>The researchers, led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1052539" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1052539" sys_relationshipid="7275614" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="1052539">M. Constanza Camargo, Ph.D.</a>, analyzed data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Tumor Registries, which includes 45 states and about 80% of the U.S. population, to track cancer trends by race/ethnicity, age, and birth year. In the general population, noncardia gastric cancer incidence fell by about 2.3% per year between 1995 and 2013. However, this seemingly favorable trend masks the 1.3% yearly increase in incidence among Americans younger than 50. Examining the data by birth year, Camargo and colleagues found that while people born before 1951 experienced decreasing rates of noncardia cancer over time, incidence went up over time among people in later generations. Earlier studies have shown a similar increase in incidence among young people but were not able to distinguish between Hispanic white and non-Hispanic white individuals due to lack of specificity in census data. In this analysis, trends were most pronounced in non-Hispanic whites, particularly women. The team also observed a modest increase in incidence among young Hispanic whites, and no significant increase among blacks or other races (mainly representing people of Asian descent).</p>
<p>Extrapolating these trends into the next few decades, the team predicted two major reversals in gastric noncardia cancer patterns in the U.S. population. First, around 2025, incidence rates are projected to become higher in women than in men, a reversal of the current sex ratio. Second, by 2030, overall incidence of noncardia cancer will no longer be decreasing. In coming decades, the medical community may need to re-envision the &ldquo;typical&rdquo; noncardia gastric cancer patient.</p>
<p>Additionally, the study authors question one of the leading explanations for changing noncardia cancer incidence in young people: an increase in Helicobacter pylori bacterial infections due to immigration from countries with higher infection rates. Instead, they suggest that the observed split between older and younger generations may be related to decreased bacterial exposure due to modern living conditions as well as the beginning of widespread antibiotic medication use in the 1950&rsquo;s. They further explain that the stronger increase in incidence among women is consistent with the higher usage of antibiotics by women compared to men. The authors point to rising rates of autoimmune conditions in general and speculate that antibiotic medications may increase the risk of developing autoimmune gastritis, which is one of the major causes of noncardia gastric cancer. No matter the underlying cause of the trends, however, antibiotics remain a life-saving tool and should be used when medically necessary.</p>

<p>Oral contraceptives have been widely used by U.S. women for over 50 years. In addition to preventing pregnancy, these medications have been shown to either increase or decrease a woman&rsquo;s risk of developing certain cancers, though the reasons why are not fully understood. Notably, many questions remain around how oral contraceptive use affects cancer risk in subpopulations of women, such as smokers and overweight women. These groups are already at higher risk for many cancers, so it is especially important to understand how oral contraceptive use changes cancer risks in these women. To address this gap, DCEG researchers investigated whether the relationship between oral contraceptive use and risks for ovarian, endometrial, breast, and colorectal cancers change when looking at groups of women who have different health behaviors in the years leading up to and during menopause (for example, smoking, alcohol use, BMI, and physical activity). The findings were published on January 18, 2018 in <em>JAMA Oncology</em>.</p>
<p>Analyzing data from nearly 200,000 women from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=89&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1033198#Michels" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033198" sys_relationshipid="7274845" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1033198#michels">Kara Michels, Ph.D.</a>, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=802306" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="802306" sys_relationshipid="7274846" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="802306">Britton Trabert, Ph.D., M.S.</a>, and colleagues found that long-term oral contraceptive use (10 years or longer) was associated with reduced risk for ovarian cancer regardless of other health behaviors in later life. Long term oral contraceptive use also reduced risks for endometrial cancer, but this reduction was strongest for women who were current smokers, obese, or rarely exercised.</p>
<p>Oral contraceptive use was generally not associated with either colorectal cancer or breast cancer.</p>
<p>Previous studies have reported that current or recent use of oral contraceptives may slightly increase breast cancer risk. However, the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study enrolled women who were between 50 and 71 years of age, most of whom were neither current nor recent users of oral contraceptives.</p>
<p>In the future, these findings should be replicated in other populations, particularly among a more diverse group of women. Research to evaluate risks among users of contemporary oral contraceptive medications is also needed. The medications prescribed today are different from those available between the 1960s and 1980s, when most of the study participants would have taken them.</p>
<p>The authors note that the results of this analysis indicate that oral contraceptive use may be beneficial for cancer prevention for a range of women with different underlying cancer risk.</p>

<p>In a new study of female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) report on the subtypes of breast cancer most likely to develop in this high-risk population. They found that ER-negative cancers were nearly six times more common in Hodgkin lymphoma&nbsp;survivors than they were among the general population, compared to ER-positive cancers which were three times more common. Risk for second breast cancer&nbsp;varied by treatment: risk for ER-negative disease was elevated for all survivors, while only those who received radiotherapy experienced higher risk of ER-positive breast cancer. This study, the&nbsp;largest to describe second breast cancer incidence by subtype among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, was published Thursday, January 18, 2018, in <em>JAMA Oncology</em>.</p>

<p>In a population of 1,000,000 women undergoing state-of-the-art cervical cancer screening, researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) found that overweight and obese women had an increased risk of cervical cancer compared to normal weight women, likely due to less effective cervical cancer screening. The findings were published January 22, 2018, in the <em>Journal of Clinical Oncology</em>.</p>
<p>Some previous studies have linked obesity with increased cervical cancer incidence and mortality, though the reasons have not been well-understood. This paper reports on screening data from 1,000,000 women undergoing routine cytology (i.e., Pap) and human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing (&ldquo;co-testing&rdquo;) in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care system.</p>
<p>The goal of screening is to identify and treat cervical precancers before cervical cancer develops. Precancers are typically diagnosed through detection of persistent HPV infection and/or abnormal cytology results. Initially, a KPNC technologist noticed that cervical cancers were being diagnosed more often in obese women, and that cancers in obese women were more likely to be HPV negative. In following up on this observation, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=191&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302417" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302417" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7275164" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302417">Dr. Megan Clarke</a> and colleagues confirmed that increasing body mass index (BMI) was associated with a lower rate of detection of cervical precancer, and a corresponding higher risk of cervical cancer diagnosis, irrespective of age, race/ethnicity, HPV status, and histology.</p>
<p>Evidence from this study suggests that reduced sensitivity of both HPV and cytology testing, in addition to inadequate cervical visualization if a biopsy is indicated, may be contributing to reduced efficacy of cervical cancer screening in overweight and obese women. Improvements in equipment and/or procedures to assure adequate sampling and visualization of women with elevated body mass might reduce cervical cancer incidence.</p>

<p>DCEG hosted a lecture in late January by the eminent statistician Sir David Cox, Ph.D. Speaking to a large audience via videoconference from his office in Oxford, England, Sir David presented his thoughts on broad unifying principles and new challenges in statistics. He discussed the role of statistics in emerging fields, such as machine learning and &ldquo;big data&rdquo; analysis, and delved into the difficult issue of how to define and prove causality. Sir David ended his talk by examining generalizability versus specificity of study results, and the implications for the field of precision medicine.</p>
<p>Sir David is an international expert in the field of biostatistics, best known for the eponymous Cox proportional hazards model, first published in 1972. His numerous contributions to the field have significantly advanced statistical methods and their application. He is an emeritus professor at Nuffield College of Oxford University.</p>

<p>Charles E. Land, Ph.D., an internationally acclaimed statistical expert on radiation risk assessment, died January 25, 2018, at his home in Portugal. He retired in August 2009 from his position of principal investigator in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=110&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302459" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302459" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7275540" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="302459">Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB)</a> in the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), after a 34-year career. Dr. Land will be remembered not only for his pioneering work in modern radiation dose-response analysis and modeling of low-dose cancer risk, but also as a delightful humble man who loved his family, Japan, music, and his work. He was a generous mentor and beloved friend to his REB colleagues and many others.</p>
<p>Dr. Land earned a Ph.D. in statistics from the University of Chicago and began his career studying radiation at the Atomic Bomb Casualty Commission (ABCC) in Hiroshima, where he conducted the first dose-response analysis of cancer risk in the Life Span Study cohort of atomic bomb survivors in collaboration with the late Dr. Gilbert Beebe.</p>
<p>In 1975, he joined NCI as a founding member of REB. He continued collaborating with the ABCC and its successor, the Radiation Effects Research Foundation, and led numerous other studies. In a series of seminal investigations, he and his colleagues clarified the pattern of breast cancer risk associated with radiation exposure. These studies provided new mechanistic insights into breast carcinogenesis, while serving as the prototype for epidemiologic studies of other radiogenic cancers.</p>
<p>His work on the probability of causation was critical for the US workers radiation compensation program. The sophisticated statistical models that he developed with uncertainty intervals formed the basis for the online <a href="https://radiationcalculators.cancer.gov/irep/">Interactive RadioEpidemiological Program (IREP)</a>, which is still in use today. Dr. Land was instrumental in elucidating the cancer risk following radioactive fallout from the U.S. nuclear weapons testing program. In addition, he analyzed data for studies of global and other radioactive fallout scenarios, initiated a study of thyroid nodules among residents in radiation-contaminated Kazakhstan.</p>

I still refer frequently to his classic 1980 Science paper, where he elegantly explained the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7403879">statistical and practical difficulties in low-dose radiation epidemiology</a>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Land served on many important radiation protection committees, including the International Commission on Radiological Protection, the National Academy of Sciences Committee on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation, and the Three Mile Island Follow-up Research Subcommittee. His numerous awards and honors included the NIH Director&rsquo;s Award and NIH Merit Award, the NCI Charles Harkin Award for Research in Thyroid Cancer, and the USPHS Outstanding Service and Meritorious Service medals. In 2010, he delivered the Thirty-Fourth Lauriston S. Taylor Lecture at the Annual Meeting of the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements. In his introduction for this prestigious lecture, Owen Hoffman quoted Charles as saying, &ldquo;All I did was to discover and explain the obvious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Land is survived by his wife Vera and sons, David and Graham.</p>

<h4>Oral Contraceptives</h4>
<p>Data on women in the prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study were used in two studies to evaluate the association between oral contraceptive (OC) use and cancer incidence. Any OC use conferred a statistically significant 3% reduction in the risk for any cancer. Expected risk reductions that strengthened with duration of use were identified for ovarian and endometrial cancers and were suggested for kidney cancer. Long-term OC use was consistently associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk across lifestyle factors, while the greatest risk reductions for endometrial cancer were observed among women at risk for chronic diseases (i.e., smokers, obese BMI). Risk was reduced for non-Hodgkin lymphoma (hazard ratio = 0.79) with 10+ years of use. In addition, there was a 37% reduced risk for bladder cancer and 46% increased risk for pancreatic cancer among long-term users who were &le;60 years of age at baseline. (Michels KA, Brinton LA, Pfeiffer RM, Trabert B. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29394309">Oral contraceptive use and risks of cancer in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study</a>. <em>Am J Epidemiol</em> 2018; Epub Jan 31.

<h4>Metabolomics</h4>
<p>A serum metabolomic analysis of 620 men in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study revealed the strongest associations with overall mortality for N-acetylvaline), and dimethylglycine, 7-methylguanine, C-glycosyltryptophan, taurocholate, and N-acetyltryptophan. C-Glycosyltryptophan, 7-methylguanine, and 4-androsten-3beta,17beta-diol disulfate were statistically significantly associated with CVD mortality. No metabolite was associated with cancer mortality at false discovery rate &lt;0.1.

<h3><a id="Breast"></a>Breast</h3>
<h4>Insulin-Like Growth Factor</h4>
<p>Lesser degrees of terminal duct lobular unit (TDLU) involution, as reflected by higher numbers of TDLUs and acini/TDLU, are associated with elevated breast cancer risk. In rodent models, the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) system regulates involution of the mammary gland. In a cross-sectional analysis of healthy women who donated normal breast tissue to the Komen Tissue Bank for research, investigators found evidence of associations of serum levels of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 with histologic measures of TDLU involution. Higher circulating levels of postmenopausal IGFBP-3 were associated with greater degrees of TDLU involution, indicated by lower TDLU count, among both Caucasian and African American women. Among Caucasian women, there were also positive associations of premenopausal IGF-I:IGFBP-3 molar ratio with both TDLU count and the product of TDLU count and acini count/TDLU. (Oh H, Pfeiffer RM, Falk RT, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29473153">Serum insulin-like growth factor-I and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 in relation to terminal duct lobular unit involution of the normal breast in Caucasian and African American women: The Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2018; Epub Feb 22).</p>
<h4>Metabolomics and Breast Cancer Risk</h4>
<p>A metabolomic study of prediagnostic serum from postmenopausal women was conducted to identify body mass index (BMI)-associated metabolites that were also associated with breast cancer risk. A total of 67 of 617 identified metabolites were associated with BMI and two of these metabolites&mdash;16a-hydroxy DHEA 3-sulfate and 3-methylglutarylycarnitine&mdash;were strongly associated with breast cancer risk. These metabolites and allo-isoleucine and 2-methylbutyrylcarnitine were also associated with estrogen receptor (ER)+ breast cancer. The addition of these metabolites to models caused the BMI&ndash;breast cancer association to attenuate. Taken together, the findings point toward metabolic pathways that may contribute to breast carcinogenesis and that may underlie the association of BMI with increased risk of postmenopausal breast cancer. (Moore SC, Playdon MC, Sampson JN, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29325144">A metabolomics analysis of body mass index and postmenopausal breast cancer risk</a>. <em>J Natl Cancer Inst</em> 2018; Epub Jan 9)</p>
<h4>Microbiome</h4>
<p>The diversity and composition of the gut microbiota may affect breast cancer risk by modulating systemic levels of estrogens and inflammation. This hypothesis was tested among 48 postmenopausal breast cancer cases and 40 controls by identifying breast cancer associations with an inflammation marker, estrogen levels, and fecal microbes that were or were not coated with mucosal immunoglobulin A (IgA). Breast cancer was found to be associated with significant, but differing, associations with both the immune-recognized (IgA-positive) and -unrecognized (IgA-negative) gut microbiota. In their IgA-positive microbiota, cases had increased abundance of Immune System Diseases metabolic pathways but low alpha diversity. The cases&rsquo; IgA-negative microbiota also had low alpha diversity; however, their IgA-negative microbiota alpha diversity was not correlated with their estrogen levels. These findings suggest that breast cancer risk may be influenced through enterohepatic cycling of estrogens by the IgA-negative microbiota and also through immune-mediated pathways by the IgA-positive microbiota. (Goedert JJ, Hua X, Bielecka A, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29360814">Postmenopausal breast cancer and oestrogen associations with the IgA-coated and IgA-noncoated faecal microbiota</a>. <em>Br J Cancer</em> 2018; Epub Jan 23)</p>

<h4>Alcohol and Estrogen Metabolites</h4>
<p>Understanding hormonal mechanisms influenced by lifestyle exposures, such as alcohol consumption, may provide targets for cancer prevention in high-risk populations. In this population of 1864 postmenopausal women within the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative-Observational Study, there was a positive association between alcohol consumption and estrone, estradiol and 2-hydroxylation estrogen metabolite concentrations among menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) users. There was also an association between liquor consumption and parent estrogens among non-MHT users, who consumed larger doses of liquor than MHT users. The study strengthens the evidence that alcohol consumption increases circulating estrogen among postmenopausal women. (Playdon MC, Coburn SB, Moore SC, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235567">Alcohol and oestrogen metabolites in postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study</a>. <em>Br J Cancer</em> 2017; Epub Dec 12)</p>
<h4>Recurrence by Race and Ethnicity</h4>
<p>Non-Hispanic black (NHB) women are more likely to experience an endometrial carcinoma (EC) recurrence, compared to non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Data from the NRG Oncology/Gynecology Oncology Group (GOG) 210 Study extend the literature on racial disparities in EC by demonstrating higher recurrence risk among NHB women diagnosed with low-grade endometrioid, carcinosarcoma or stage I tumors, compared to their NHW counterparts, while Hispanic women with stage III disease experienced higher recurrence risk. No racial differences in recurrence risk for women were observed in subgroups characterized by other tumor characteristics, suggesting some specificity in the association.

<h4>Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons</h4>
<p>Consumption of <em>mat&eacute;</em>, an infusion of the herb <em>Ilex paraguariensis</em> (<em>yerba mat&eacute;</em>), is associated with increased risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but the carcinogenic mechanism is unclear. Commercial brands of <em>yerba mat&eacute;</em> contain high levels of carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are acquired during the traditional drying process. This study characterized exposure to PAHs in the urine of 244 <em>mat&eacute;</em> drinkers over a wide range of <em>mat&eacute;</em> consumption. The urinary concentrations of PAH metabolites were significantly associated with self-reported amount of recent <em>mat&eacute;</em> intake, with concentrations of some PAH metabolites as much as results from smoking cigarettes. The PAH content of <em>mat&eacute;</em> may contribute to the increased risk of ESCC in <em>mat&eacute;</em> drinkers. (Lopes AB, Metzdorf M, Metzdorf L, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29263183">Urinary concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon metabolites in <em>mat&eacute;</em> drinkers in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil</a>. <em>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</em> 2017; Epub Dec 20)</p>
<h4>Selenium and Other Minerals</h4>
<p>Studies conducted in China linked selenium deficiency to higher risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), but this has not been widely tested outside that selenium-deficient region. A study of ESCC cases and controls from the Golestan Cohort Study, conducted in Iran, a high-risk area for ESCC, showed relatively high selenium status among the population generally and no evidence of association between selenium or chromium concentrations in toenails and the risk of ESCC. (Hashemian M, Murphy G, Etemadi A, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29125237">Toenail mineral concentration and risk of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, results from the Golestan Cohort Study</a>. <em>Cancer Med</em> 2017; Epub Nov 10)</p>
<h4>Sex Steroid Hormones</h4>
<p>Esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) is characterized by a strong male predominance. In the first population-based study to evaluate whether sex steroid hormones underlie this sex disparity, higher androgen:estrogen ratio metrics were associated with increased odds of EA. All estrogens and androgens were associated with significant decreased odds of EA. When restricted to individuals with minimal to no decrease in body mass index, the size of association for the androgen:estrogen ratio was not greatly altered. The study provides tentative evidence that androgen:estrogen balance may be a factor related to EA. (Petrick JL, Falk RT, Hyland PL, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29342161">Association between circulating levels of sex steroid hormones and esophageal adenocarcinoma in the FINBAR Study</a>. <em>PLoS One</em> 2018 Jan 17;)</p>

<h4>Magnesium and Epstein-Barr Virus</h4>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) causes endemic Burkitt lymphoma (eBL). EBV control was improved by magnesium (Mg2+) supplementation in XMEN, an X-linked genetic disease associated with Mg2+ deficiency, high circulating EBV levels (viral loads), and EBV-related lymphomas. This study reports the results of an investigation of the relationship between Mg2+ levels and EBV levels and eBL in Uganda. There were strong, consistent, and independent inverse associations between plasma Mg2+ levels and peripheral blood EBV viral load in women, and with eBL risk in children, consistent with the hypothesis. Overall, there was evidence of mild Mg2+ deficiency in about 14% of healthy children, about 35% of women with low EBV viral load, and about 43% of children with eBL. These results suggest that mild Mg2+ deficiency is relatively frequent and may be relevant for EBV control in Uganda. (Juan R, Otim I, Nabalende H, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29248801">Plasma magnesium is inversely associated with Epstein-Barr virus load in peripheral blood and Burkitt lymphoma in Uganda</a>. <em>Cancer Epidemiol</em> 2018; Epub 2017 Dec 14)</p>
<h4>Physical Activity</h4>
<p>An investigation of the relationships of physical activity and TV viewing time before and after diagnosis of a hematologic cancer with mortality was conducted among the NIH-AARP Diet and Health. Increased moderate- to vigorous-intensity physical activity (MVPA) both before and after diagnosis was associated with reduced risk of all-cause mortality among adult survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia. Pre-diagnosis MVPA was also related to decreased risk of hematologic cancer-specific mortality. By comparison, the association between post-diagnosis MVPA and hematologic cancer-specific mortality was not statistically significant. The results for TV viewing and mortality risk did not show a clear pattern. (Schmid D, Behrens G, Arem H, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29385194">Pre- and post-diagnosis physical activity, television viewing, and mortality among hematologic cancer survivors</a>. <em>PLoS One</em> 2018 Jan 31)</p>

<h4>Oral HPV Infection</h4>
<p>Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to evaluate the population-level effect of prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on the burden of oral HPV infections in young U.S. women and men. HPV vaccination was associated with an estimated 88% reduction in prevalence of vaccine-type oral HPV 16/18/6/11 infections among vaccinated young adults in the United States. However, because of a vaccination rate of only 18.3% (29.2% in women and 6.9% in men) between 2011 and 2014 among individuals 18 to 33 years of age, the population-level effect on oral HPV16/18/6/11 infections was a modest 17% overall, and particularly low in men, 6.9%. (Chaturvedi AK, Graubard BI, Broutian T, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29182497">Effect of prophylactic human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination on oral HPV infections among young adults in the United States</a>. <em>J Clin Oncol</em> 2018; Epub 2017 Nov 28)</p>
<h4>T-cell Receptor Repertoires</h4>
<p>It is unknown why a minority of women fail to control human papillomavirus (HPV) cervical infection and go on to develop precancer/cancer. Differences in T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoires may identify HPV 16-infected women at highest risk for progression. In an exploratory case-control study nested within the Guanacaste HPV Natural History Study, using a novel deep-sequencing approach to interrogate the CDR3 &beta;-chain region of the TCR, differences in the TCR repertoires of women who controlled or failed to control their HPV 16 infection were detected. Women who developed HPV 16-associated CIN 3+ (cases) had a more diverse T-cell repertoire (i.e. more unique TCR sequences [TCR richness]) at the time of lesion diagnosis compared to women with an incidentally detected cervical HPV 16 infection that was undetectable within 12 months (controls). Further, the relative abundance of a specific V gene (<em>TRBV6-7</em>) was on average twice as abundant among controls compared to cases. The combination of both TCR richness and V gene usage was strongly predictive of case-control status.

<h4><em>IFNL4</em> and Hepatitis C Virologic Relapse</h4>
<p>Analysis of data from POLARIS-2, a phase III clinical trial of sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir for the treatment of chronic infection with hepatitis C virus (HCV), extends previous observations that <em>IFNL4</em> genotype is associated with virologic relapse. Higher rates of failure with sofosbuvir-based treatment among black patients compared with whites reported in some studies likely reflect a lower frequency of favorable <em>IFNL4</em> genotypes in that population. In contrast, given that Asians have the highest frequency of favorable <em>IFNL4</em> genotypes, relapse may be least frequent in Asian populations. Consideration of these relationships might improve global strategies to treat and control HCV infection. (O'Brien TR, Kottilil S, Pfeiffer RM. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29107709"><em>IFNL4</em> genotype is associated with virologic relapse after 8-week treatment with sofosbuvir, velpatasvir, and voxilaprevir</a>. <em>Gastroenterology</em> 2017; Epub Nov 3)</p>

<h4>Detecting Mediators</h4>
<p>The authors introduced a new method for testing multiple biomarkers that may mediate exposure/disease relationships. This computationally efficient method can maintain specified family-wise error rates (FWER) and false discovery rates (FDR), and should be very useful in modern studies evaluating high dimensional biomarkers. They applied this new method to a study evaluating the mechanistic relationship between increased BMI and an increased risk of breast cancer. An R package MultiMed is available on https://github.com/SiminaB/MultiMed-devel. (Sampson JN, Boca SM, Moore SC, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29420693">FWER and FDR control when testing multiple mediators</a>. <em>Bioinformatics</em> 2018; Epub Feb 6)</p>
<h4>Integrating Clinical and Omics Data</h4>
<p>Investigators used a multi-omic kernel machine learning method to systematically quantify the prognostic values of high-throughput genomic, epigenomic, and transcriptomic profiles individually, integratively, and in combination with clinical factors for 3,382 samples across 14 cancer types. The prognostic performance varied substantially across cancer types. mRNA and miRNA expression profile frequently performed the best, followed by DNA methylation profile. Germline susceptibility variants displayed low prognostic performance consistently across cancer types. The integration of omic profiles with clinical variables can lead to substantially improved prognostic performance over the use of clinical variables alone in half of cancer types examined. Moreover, the kernel machine learning method consistently outperformed existing prognostic signatures, suggesting that including a large number of omic biomarkers may provide substantial improvement in prognostic assessment in the era of precision oncology. (Zhu B, Song N, Shen R, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29209073">Integrating clinical and multiple omics data for prognostic assessment across human cancers</a>. <em>Sci Rep</em> 2017 Dec 5)</p>
<h4>Using Imputed Genotype Data</h4>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are now routinely imputed for untyped single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) based on various powerful statistical algorithms for imputation trained on reference datasets. The use of predicted allele counts for imputed SNPs as the dosage variable is known to produce valid score-test for genetic association. In this article, through systematic derivation of score-tests, the authors show how imputed data should be handled in a distinct manner in the prospective vs. retrospective likelihoods. Moreover, through an innovative use of one-step maximum-likelihood estimation, they derive a score-test and a corresponding plug-in method for handling imputed genotype in the context of the EB method that cannot be associated with an underlying likelihood. Proposed methods allow valid analysis of imputed SNPs in case-control studies of gene&ndash;environment interaction using alternative strategies that have been earlier available only for genotyped SNPs. For analysis of imputed SNPs, similar to typed SNPs, the retrospective methods can lead to considerable efficiency gain for modeling of gene-environment interactions under the assumption of gene-environment independence. Methods are made available for public use through CGEN R software package.

<h4>Drug Overdose</h4>
<p>Recent dramatic increases in drug overdose deaths have largely been attributed to opioid-related deaths in non-Hispanic white (NHW) persons, but less attention has been paid to increased rates among other racial and ethnic groups, or the role of drugs other than opioids. Investigators analyzed U.S. overdose deaths among non-Hispanic black (NHB) and Hispanic persons and NHW persons between 2000 and 2015 by drug type. They showed that cocaine-related overdose deaths among NHB persons are on par with heroin- and prescription opioid&ndash;related deaths among NHW women and men and that cocaine is a consistent and important contributor to deaths among Hispanic and NHW persons. These deaths are an important, long-term public health problem that is often overlooked. (Shiels MS, Freedman ND, Thomas D, de Gonzalez AB. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29204603">Trends in U.S. drug overdose deaths in non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic white persons, 2000-2015</a>. <em>Ann Intern Med</em> 2017; Epub Dec 5) For more information, read <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1424&amp;sys_contentid=1102007" sys_dependentvariantid="1424" sys_dependentid="1102007" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7270259" sys_variantid="1424" sys_contentid="1102007">Cocaine contributes to overdose deaths among some minorities</a> in Research News &amp; Highlights.</p>

<h4>Susceptibility Locus Associated with Survival</h4>
<p>The investigators conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) for overall survival in osteosarcoma using data from a multistage, international collaborative effort. One locus, <em>GLDC/IL33</em> at 9p24.1, was associated with overall survival, which suggests that germline genetics can influence osteosarcoma outcomes, independent of metastatic disease. The moderate to large effect sizes for a single-nucleotide polymorphism associated with overall survival was similar to the magnitude of effects observed in an earlier GWAS of metastatic disease at osteosarcoma diagnosis. It was also comparable to GWAS of other pediatric and young adulthood cancers, and higher than those observed in adult GWAS of common cancer susceptibility. (Koster R, Panagiotou OA, Wheeler WA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29210060">Genome-wide association study identifies the <em>GLDC/IL33</em> locus associated with survival of osteosarcoma patients</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2018; Epub 2017 Dec 23)</p>

<h4>Alcohol and Estrogen Metabolites</h4>
<p>Understanding hormonal mechanisms influenced by lifestyle exposures, such as alcohol consumption, may provide targets for cancer prevention intervention in high-risk populations. In this population of 1864 postmenopausal women within the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative-Observational Study, there was a positive association between alcohol consumption and estrone, estradiol and 2-hydroxylation estrogen metabolite concentrations among menopausal hormone therapy (MHT) users. There was also an association between liquor consumption and parent estrogens among non-MHT users, who consumed larger doses of liquor than MHT users. The study strengthens the evidence that alcohol consumption increases circulating estrogen among postmenopausal women. (Playdon MC, Coburn SB, Moore SC, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29235567">Alcohol and oestrogen metabolites in postmenopausal women in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study</a>. <em>Br J Cancer</em> 2017; Epub Dec 12)</p>
<h4>Incidence and Survival</h4>
<p>Using data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, investigators analyzed population-based incidence and survival data for fallopian tube carcinoma <em>in situ</em> (CIS; a surrogate of serous tubal intraepithelial carcinoma, which may represent the first manifestation of many high-grade cancers that were once considered ovarian primary tumors), tubal carcinomas, and, for comparison, ovarian carcinomas. Reporting of tubal CIS and tubal carcinoma was found to have increased in recent years, likely reflecting changes in pathology processing of specimens and diagnosis. Developing standardized reporting for tubal neoplasms is needed to enable analysis of outcomes for these comparatively uncommon but increasingly recognized tumors.

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>The largest pancreatic cancer genome-wide association study to date, including 9,040 patients and 12,496 controls of European ancestry from the Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium (PanScan) and the Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4), identified a novel association at rs78417682 (7p12/<em>TNS3</em>). Replication of 10 promising signals in up to 2,737 patients and 4,752 controls from the PANcreatic Disease ReseArch (PANDoRA) consortium yields new genome-wide significant loci: rs13303010 at 1p36.33 (<em>NOC2L</em>), rs2941471 at 8q21.11 (<em>HNF4G</em>), rs4795218 at 17q12 (<em>HNF1B</em>), and rs1517037 at 18q21.32 (<em>GRP</em>). rs78417682 was not statistically significantly associated with pancreatic cancer in PANDoRA. Expression quantitative trait locus analysis in three independent pancreatic data sets provides molecular support of <em>NOC2L</em> as a pancreatic cancer susceptibility gene. (Klein AP, Wolpin BM, Risch HA, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29422604">Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies five new susceptibility loci for pancreatic cancer</a>. <em>Nat Commun</em> 2018)</p>
<h4>Opium Use</h4>
<p>Data from a large-scale prospective cohort of the general population in the Northeast of Iran demonstrated an association of opium consumption with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer in a dose-dependent manner. A significantly higher proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer reported ever use of opium and those who used higher cumulative doses of opium (&ge;5th quintile) demonstrated a four-times higher risk, which persisted after adjustments for multiple potentially confounding factors, including age, sex, cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, body mass index, and diabetes mellitus. Opium is now suggested to be an emerging cancer risk factor for pancreatic cancer.

<h4>Trends in Metastatic Disease</h4>
<p>Metastatic prostate cancer remains a highly lethal malignancy in the U.S. As prostate-specific antigen testing declines nationally, investigators used data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registries to perform a detailed assessment of current age- and race-specific incidence trends with quantitative forecasting. The incidence of metastatic prostate cancer was found to have increased more rapidly since 2012, when the United States Preventive Services Task Force recommendations against prostate-specific antigen testing for prostate cancer were issued, resulting in a rise in both future incidence and the number of new cases by 2025. Future incidence rates and the number of new cases were reduced in alternative forecasts based on data prior to 2012 recommendations. The incidence of metastatic disease in black men is still expected to occur at considerably higher rates compared with that in white men.

<h4>Myotonic Dystrophy</h4>
<p>Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is an inherited multisystem neuromuscular disorder caused by a CTG trinucleotide repeat expansion in the <em>DMPK</em> gene. Recent evidence documents that DM1 patients have an increased risk of certain cancers, but whether skin cancer risks are elevated is unclear. Using the UK Clinical Practice Research Datalink, investigators observed that DM1 patients had a significantly increased risk of skin cancer overall (hazard ratio&thinsp;=&thinsp;5.44), with the highest risk seen for basal cell carcinoma.

<h4>Changing Incidence Patterns</h4>
<p>The initial step for noncardia gastric carcinogenesis is atrophic gastritis, driven by either <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> infection or autoimmunity. In recent decades, the prevalence rates of these two major causes declined and increased, respectively, with changes in Western lifestyles. Data from 45 North American Association of Central Cancer Tumor Registries indicates that the epidemiology of gastric cancer is changing among non-Hispanic whites, extending prior observations for different population groups. The key finding is an age interaction over time, with rising noncardia incidence among younger persons and falling rates among older persons. These trends are consistent with a birth cohort effect, with rising incidence rates from older to younger generations. Increases were more pronounced among women than men and preferentially involved the corpus of the stomach. If current patterns continue, forecasting models predict two notable reversals by 2030: overall incidence will no longer be decreasing, and female incidence will exceed male incidence rates.

<h4>Serum Pepsinogen 1 and anti-<em>Helicobacter pylori</em></h4>
<p>Serum pepsinogen 1 (SPG1) and anti-<em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (<em>H. pylori</em>) serology have been used for gastric risk stratification in Asia. This study assessed the utility of these markers in a Western population, male Finnish smokers enrolled in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. Pre-diagnostic low SPG1 was associated with increased gastric cancer risk. Even a single measurement of SPG1 along with <em>H. pylori</em> whole cell and CagA serology provides potentially useful prediction of gastric cancer risk.

<h4>Radiation, Gene Mutations, and Fusions</h4>
<p>Exposure to ionizing radiation during childhood is a well-established risk factor for thyroid cancer. However, the genetic mechanisms of radiation-associated carcinogenesis remain not fully understood. In this study, targeted next-generation sequencing and RNA-Seq was used to study 65 papillary thyroid cancers (PTCs) from persons exposed to iodine-131 (<sup>131</sup>I) thyroid as a result of the Chernobyl accident. Driver mutations were identified in 96.9% of these thyroid cancers, including point mutations in 26.2% and gene fusions in 70.8% of cases. Novel driver fusions such as <em>POR-BRAF</em>, as well as <em>STRN-ALK</em> fusions that have not been implicated in radiation-associated cancer before, were found. Relative to tumors with point mutations, the proportion of tumors with gene fusions increased with radiation dose.

<p>Humans are superorganisms, made up of both human and microbial cells. Teeming inside and outside our bodies are trillions of microbes from thousands of different species of bacteria, fungi, parasites, and viruses. They can live on or within many different areas of the body, such as the skin, gut, mouth, eyes, and genitals.</p>
<p>In a healthy person, these microbes coexist peacefully, and some assist with essential physiological functions. For example, they produce vitamins humans lack the genes to make, help digest our food, regulate our immune system, and protect against other microbes that cause disease. But if something happens to disturb the balance of our microbial ecosystems&mdash;brought on by infectious illnesses, certain diets, or the prolonged use of antibiotics or other bacteria-destroying medications&mdash;our bodies may become more susceptible to disease.</p>
<p>In recent years, DCEG investigators led by <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/abnet-christian">Christian Abnet, Ph.D.</a>, Chief of the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch, and <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/sinha-rashmi">Rashmi Sinha, Ph.D.</a>, have developed a program to advance epidemiologic research on the microbiome, which refers to the collection of the gene sequences from the community of microbes in the human body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The microbiome is an underexplored aspect of human physiology,&rdquo; said Dr. Abnet. &ldquo;Recent progress in DNA sequencing and the <a href="https://hmpdacc.org/">Human Microbiome Project</a> have laid the groundwork for powerful investigations. However, there are few well-conducted epidemiologic studies evaluating the role of the human microbiota and its related metabolites in cancer development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drs. Abnet, Sinha, and colleagues have developed a multi-pronged approach to achieve this goal. They are evaluating new methods to develop best practices; exploring the feasibility of incorporating fecal and oral collections into new or existing cohorts; conducting etiologic studies; and evaluating associations of cancer risk factors (i.e. body mass index [BMI] and diet) with the microbiome and metabolome. In addition, Dr. Abnet, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/chaturvedi-anil">Anil Chaturvedi, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/freedman-neal">Neal Freedman, Ph.D.</a>, are leading a study to evaluate the impact of tobacco use on oral health and the oral microbiome.</p>
<p><strong>Methods Development</strong></p>
<p>With the advent of high-throughput methods for bacterial gene sequencing, DCEG investigators have taken a leadership role in adapting these methods to epidemiologic studies, standardizing them, and ensuring the approaches are sound.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While microbiome research has grown exponentially over the past several years, findings have been difficult to reproduce,&rdquo; said Dr. Sinha, an expert in the field of gut microbiomics. &ldquo;The variability induced by sample collection and storage, DNA extraction, bioinformatic processing, and statistical analysis has not been systematically assessed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tackling these issues head on, Drs. Sinha, Abnet, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/meb-fellows#Vogtmann">Emily Vogtmann, Ph.D.</a>, and colleagues have <a href="#References">developed reliable methods of collecting fecal and oral samples</a> that can be easily and cost-effectively implemented in cohorts. They considered several issues, such as preservation of a microbial signature in samples, stability of samples under field conditions, and preservation of samples to maximize flexible use in multi 'omics' assays.</p>

<p>In addition, Dr. Sinha says, &ldquo;it is crucial to have appropriate standard reference materials for quality control of DNA extraction and sequencing samples in large epidemiologic studies.&rdquo; She and collaborators have <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26653756">developed two types of standards</a>, a chemostat produced in an artificial gut system, also called a &ldquo;Robogut,&rdquo; and artificial communities with known bacterial mixtures. Negative controls are equally critical and need to be included in studies.</p>
<p>The degree of standardization in microbiome measurement necessary for translation to large-scale studies is early in its development. Drs. Sinha, Abnet, and colleagues successfully initiated and completed a multidisciplinary collaborative project known as the <a href="http://www.mbqc.org/">Microbiome Quality Control (MBQC) Study</a> that included numerous laboratories to investigate the impact of DNA extraction, PCR amplification, sequencing, and bioinformatics on microbial results. In 2014, they organized a <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/people-in-the-news/archive/microbiome-workshop">workshop to present MBQC results</a> to researchers from a wide array of disciplines ranging from molecular biology to statistics. In a 2017 publication, they <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28967885">reported a baseline investigation of variability from the MBQC project</a>, in which blinded specimen sets from human stool, chemostats, and artificial microbial communities were sequenced by 15 laboratories and analyzed by nine bioinformatics laboratories. Investigators found that while each microbiome protocol step&mdash;including sample handling environment, DNA extraction, and bioinformatic processing&mdash;has the potential to introduce variation, they highlighted the potential effects of DNA extraction methods as a crucial target for standardization. &ldquo;These results may guide researchers in experimental design choices for gut microbiome studies,&rdquo; Dr. Sinha said. &ldquo;We have set the stage for the next phase of addressing variability.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drs. Sinha and Vogtmann are also collaborating with biostatistician <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/shi-jianxin">Jianxin Shi, Ph.D.</a>, to quantify the stability of the human microbiome over time. They are evaluating the impact of temporal variability in microbiome measurements on sample size requirements for etiologic studies. Results could have important implications for designing and analyzing future studies.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators are exploring the feasibility of collecting fecal and oral specimens in a variety of existing cohorts and populations to develop the resources necessary to support large, prospective studies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Owing to a lack of cohorts with fecal samples, the majority of microbiome studies to date have used a case-control design,&rdquo; Dr. Sinha said. &ldquo;Although these studies have provided insight into the differences between the microbiome of those with and without cancer, they are unable to evaluate how the microbiome may be related to etiology.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To bridge this gap, Dr. Sinha and collaborators have successfully collected fecal and oral samples in existing prospective studies in the United States and Bangladesh as feasibility studies.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in collaboration with the NCI Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, Drs. Sinha and Abnet organized the &ldquo;<a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/events/2017/microbiome-workshop">Next Steps in Studying the Human Microbiome and Health in Prospective Studies Workshop</a>&rdquo; in 2017. The workshop was designed to encourage cohorts to collect fecal and oral samples and to enhance communications between multidisciplinary researchers. More than 200 international attendees discussed the best collection methods, inclusion of appropriate QC samples, various issues related to sequencing and bioinformatics, and the development of appropriate statistical analyses.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators have been pursing cancer etiology hypotheses tied to the human microbiome for several years. These investigations have included studies of <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> and gastric cancer, bacterial metabolites and colorectal cancer and breast cancer, and oral health and cancer.</p>
<p>Gastric cancer is currently the model of bacterially associated cancer; <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> has been classified as carcinogenic in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Research within DCEG has evaluated how risk factors for cancer, such as tobacco, body mass index, and pepsinogen levels, are associated with microbial diversity using samples collected in China. Dr. Abnet and colleagues found that among participants with esophageal squamous dysplasia, participants at greater risk for gastric cancer (low pepsinogen I/II ratio) had lower microbial richness than those at lower risk for gastric cancer. Associations were also detected with smoking history and body mass index in these samples. Ongoing studies are being conducted to further evaluate the impact of the oral microbiome on upper gastrointestinal cancer risk.</p>
<p>The association between the human gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC) is another important focus of DCEG research. In a case-control study with data and fecal specimens previously collected in DCEG, investigators found that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24316595">CRC cases had reduced fecal microbiome alpha diversity</a>, increased carriage of <em>Fusobacterium</em> and <em>Porphyromonas</em> taxa, and reduced abundance of <em>Clostridia</em> taxa. Metabolomic analysis of the same specimens uncovered 41 small molecules that differed between cases and controls, providing insights on carcinogenesis.</p>

<p>A proposed association between the gut microbiota and breast cancer is supported by a small case-control study by former DCEG investigator James Goedert, M.D., and colleagues that suggested that <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26032724">postmenopausal women with&nbsp;breast cancer&nbsp;have lower gut microbial diversity</a>. To further explore this relationship, Dr. Sinha, Vogtmann, and colleagues analyzed fecal samples from breast cancer cases, benign breast disease cases, and controls from three hospitals in Ghana. They found lower alpha diversity in both breast cancer and benign breast disease cases as compared to controls.</p>
<p>Poor oral health and periodontal pathogens have been associated with a number of cancers, mortality, and other chronic diseases, which suggests a role for the oral microbiome in the development of these conditions. Drs. Abnet, Sinha, Vogtmann, and colleagues are assessing the association between the oral microbiome and incident cancers of the bronchus/lung, colorectum, esophagus, head/neck, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, small intestine and stomach, in nested case-cohort studies within the Agricultural Health Study, NIH-AARP, and the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovary (PLCO) Cohort Study. This is the largest prospective evaluation of the oral microbiome and cancer incidence to date.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This multi-cancer, multi-cohort project will allow us to test several hypotheses simultaneously, provide greater insight into the role of the oral microbiome in cancer at several sites, and allow us to evaluate common mechanisms across cancer sites,&rdquo; Dr. Abnet said.</p>
<p><strong>Microbiome Associations with BMI and Diet</strong></p>
<p>There is increasing evidence that the gastrointestinal microbiome may play a role in relation to certain cancer risk factors, such as obesity and diet. Dr. Sinha and collaborators are investigating the association of the microbiome with BMI, processed meat, and drinking water nitrate intake.</p>
<p>In the Northern Finland Birth Cohort, individuals who have been followed since birth in 1966, the investigators found that fecal alpha diversity (i.e., microbial community richness) was lower in individuals with higher BMI at age 46. BMI was associated with 56 fecal metabolites. The genera that were most frequently correlated with metabolite abundances were <em>Blautia</em>, <em>Oscillospira</em>, <em>Ruminococcus</em>,<em> Odoribacter</em>, and <em>Haemophilus</em>.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Sinha and colleagues evaluated the microbiome in a dietary intervention study of processed meat and high-nitrate water. High meat nitrate/nitrite did not affect the microbial composition in the feces or saliva. However, high-nitrate water increased nitrate-reducing bacteria in saliva, including <em>Capnocytophaga</em>, <em>Neisseria</em>, and <em>Kingella</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nitrate-reducing bacteria can convert nitrate into nitrite in the mouth, which when swallowed, can increase carcinogenic <em>N</em>-nitroso compounds in the gut,&rdquo; Dr. Sinha said.</p>
<p><strong>Tobacco Use and the Oral Microbiome</strong></p>
<p>Tobacco use is known to be a primary cause of periodontal disease and may adversely affect oral health in other ways. Tobacco use is also known to alter the bacterial biota of the mouth.</p>
<p>DCEG researchers received funding from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Tobacco Products through a trans-NIH&ndash;FDA collaboration coordinated by the <a href="https://prevention.nih.gov/tobacco-regulatory-science-program">NIH Tobacco Regulatory Science Program</a> to study the impact of tobacco use on oral health and the oral microbiome. Drs. Abnet, Chaturvedi, and Freedman, Dr. Maura Gillison of MD Anderson Cancer Center, Bruce Dye, D.D.S., M.P.H., with the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, Dr. Martin Blaser of New York University, and Dr. Rob Knight of the University of California San Diego, are investigating how tobacco-induced changes in the bacteria of the mouth may lead to adverse health consequences, including some cancers. Using oral wash samples from approximately 11,000 participants in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) study, the team will investigate the association between types of tobacco use and the oral microbiome as well as the association between the oral microbiome and tobacco-related diseases. As part of this project, the investigators recently published an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26880744">updated estimate of the percent of periodontal disease caused by tobacco</a>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study is the first to characterize the effects of tobacco on the oral microbiome in a nationally representative study population and allows for the examination of the association between the oral microbiome and tobacco-related diseases,&rdquo; Dr. Abnet said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will explore developing a biomarker of exposure,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;That means we&rsquo;ll be trying to understand what the bacteria populations in the mouths of smokers look like compared to people who don&rsquo;t use tobacco products. Our findings could be used to assess the effects of new and emerging tobacco products on the oral microbiome and human health.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tenure-track investigator <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/kitahara-cari">Cari Kitahara, Ph.D.</a>, has built a multidisciplinary research program in the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/programs-ebp/reb">Radiation Epidemiology Branch</a><span> (REB)</span> with a dual focus: to explore cancer risks from occupational and medical radiation exposures, and to investigate the etiology of radiosensitive tumors, including thyroid cancer.</p>
<p>Her work is helping to advance our understanding of the health consequences of low-dose radiation and may address important public health and clinical concerns about radiation exposure from medical sources. In addition, her research on thyroid cancer has provided some of the strongest and most compelling evidence to date to support a true increase in the incidence of the disease in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Occupational and Medical Radiation Exposure and Cancer</strong></h3>
<p>Exposure to ionizing radiation from both natural and man-made sources is ubiquitous in today&rsquo;s world. Although recognized as a known carcinogen, there are important public health questions related to quantifying the health risks from the low levels of ionizing radiation received by most of us in the general population.</p>
<p>Dr. Kitahara is particularly interested in cancer risks associated with occupational exposure to low-dose radiation from emerging medical practices and procedures. &ldquo;Occupational groups, such as radiologic technologists, are routinely monitored for radiation exposure as part of worker-safety measures,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;This provides a unique setting for studying associations between radiation and cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Much of her current work focuses on nuclear medicine (procedures that use radioactive substances to diagnose and treat disease) and fluoroscopically-guided interventional (FGI) procedures, which use ionizing radiation to guide small instruments such as catheters through blood vessels or other pathways in the body. As these types of procedures have increased in number and complexity over time, concerns have grown about the possible risks associated with radiation exposure to the medical workers who perform and assist with them, as well as the patients who receive them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We hope that findings from these studies can inform current radiation protection practices for medical workers and, more broadly, improve our understanding of the impact of low-dose radiation exposure on the risk of cancer in the general population,&rdquo; Dr. Kitahara said.</p>
<p>To better understand the exposures from these new procedures, Dr. Kitahara recruited postdoctoral dosimetry fellows <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/reb-fellows#Villoing">Daphn&eacute;e Villoing, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/reb-fellows#Borrego">David Borrego, Ph.D.</a> &ldquo;We have dosimetrists and epidemiologists working side-by-side to incorporate state-of-the-art exposure assessment into our epidemiologic work,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Bridging these two fields helps to advance our studies.&rdquo; Drs. Villoing and Borrego assist with organ and tissue dose calculations that will eventually become available for retrospective and prospective evaluations of radiation dose-response for risks of cancer and other serious health outcomes in medical radiation workers and patients.</p>

<p>The NCI began studying cancer risks in medical workers exposed to ionizing radiation decades ago. The &nbsp;<a href="https://radtechstudy.nci.nih.gov/index.html">U.S. Radiologic Technologists</a> (USRT) study was launched in the early 1980s and continues to yield important information on cancer and other disease risks among workers enrolled in the cohort. Dr. Kitahara has been working with USRT for several years: &ldquo;One of my first projects looked at cancer and cardiovascular disease in a subset of technologists who performed nuclear medicine procedures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together with her colleagues, Dr. Kitahara reported an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/26220810/">increased risk of certain cancers and cardiovascular diseases</a> in that group. &ldquo;In contrast to professionals who work with standard radiologic procedures, those who work with nuclear medicine cannot avoid being in close contact with radioactive pharmaceuticals as they prepare or administer injections and during the imaging process.&rdquo; To pursue these observations, she utilized more detailed nuclear medicine work histories collected in a follow-up of the USRT cohort to evaluate risks for a wide range of cancers and other serious diseases. Among her latest results was an <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29019450">increased risk of cataracts among technologists who reported performing diagnostic or therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the value of the USRT cohort, to fully characterize occupational radiation exposure and associated risks, Dr. Kitahara needed more contemporary data. So, she launched a new study among certified nuclear medicine technologists. &ldquo;These are professionals who received training in more recent years,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We noticed that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29390195">annual exposure levels of certified nuclear medicine staff are higher relative to most other medical radiation workers</a>, and may be increasing due to the growing number of higher-dose procedures performed in recent decades.&rdquo;</p>
<h4><strong>Risks from Fluoroscopically-guided Interventional (FGI) Procedures, Occupational Exposure</strong></h4>
<p>FGI procedures are often an alternative to more invasive surgeries, because they require only a very small incision, substantially reduce the risk of infection, and allow for shorter recovery time compared to surgical procedures. These interventions are used by a rapidly expanding number of health care providers in a wide range of medical specialties. However, many of these specialists have little training in radiation science or safety measures.</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin: 0 5px 10px 30px;">
<p>"We hope that findings from these studies can inform current radiation protection practices for medical workers and, more broadly, improve our understanding of the impact of low-dose radiation exposure on the risk of cancer in the general population."</p>
</div>
<p>Clinical reports of higher-than-expected frequency of left-sided brain tumors in physicians who do these procedures have raised concerns about occupational exposure to ionizing radiation; higher doses to the left side of the clinician&rsquo;s body result from their typical positioning to the right of the patient&rsquo;s bed.</p>
<p>In a recent study, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/linet-martha">Martha Linet, M.D., M.P.H.</a>, REB Chief <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/berrington-amy">Amy Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez, D.Phil.</a>, Dr. Kitahara, and colleagues found <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/research-news-highlights/2017/fgimds-vs-psychiatrists">no overall increased risk of death among U.S. physicians who performed FGI procedures</a>, compared to a group of physicians who did not. Importantly, they noted no elevated risk for brain cancer mortality.</p>
<p>Though reassuring, Dr. Kitahara notes that no dose information was available to assess whether these risks increased with greater exposure. She is exploring the possibility of linking this population to dosimetry data from the largest U.S. commercial dosimeter badge provider to obtain more precise measures. Additionally, follow-up of the cohort has been limited to mortality based on death certificate data, which does not provide information on the specifics of a cancer diagnosis (hemisphere of the brain, leukemia subtype, etc.). &ldquo;I hope to link our cohort to state cancer registries to obtain more detailed diagnostic information,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Under Dr. Kitahara&rsquo;s supervision, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/reb-fellows#Velazquez-Kronen">Raquel Velazquez-Kronen, M.S.</a>, a doctoral student in epidemiology, is evaluating the long-term risk of cataracts in radiologic technologists who assisted with FGI procedures. Physicians conducting these procedures have an increased risk of cataracts, but there has been limited information about the risk to other radiation-exposed staff.</p>
<h4><strong>Estimating Risks to the Patients</strong></h4>
<p>Radiation is a valuable tool for diagnosing and treating many life-threatening conditions. As with any medical intervention, there are risks and benefits to the patient. The investigations by Dr. Kitahara and others provide information for clinicians and patients as they make decisions about which techniques are most appropriate.</p>
<p>Dr. Kitahara is leading the largest and most comprehensive study to date on the long-term health effects of internal radiation exposure for patients who have been treated with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism, an over-active thyroid condition. This approach has generally been considered safe and effective, compared to alternatives like surgery or anti-thyroid medications, but there is limited information about the long-term risks for leukemia and other cancers among patients. Dr. Kitahara is applying newly estimated doses to organs and tissues in dose-response analyses of site-specific cancer mortality. The results of her study may have direct implications for clinical treatment guidelines.</p>
<p>Dr. Kitahara plans to continue expanding her research on radiation-related disease risks among patients who have undergone other nuclear medicine and FGI procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Etiology of Thyroid Cancer</strong></h3>

<p>When Dr. Kitahara arrived at DCEG in 2008 as a predoctoral fellow, the known risk factors for thyroid cancer included ionizing radiation exposure, history of thyroid nodules, and rare familial and genetic syndromes. However, these factors account for just a portion of thyroid cancer cases and were unlikely to explain the rapidly increasing incidence of the disease in the United States and many other developed countries over the past few decades. Dr. Kitahara recognized the need for large prospective studies to evaluate potential risk factors for this relatively uncommon malignancy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is a challenging area of research due, in part, to the rarity of the disease and the need to distinguish indolent versus clinically-relevant cancers,&rdquo; Dr. Kitahara said. &ldquo;Until recently, most studies of thyroid cancer were case-control in design and relied on retrospectively-collected exposure information, which makes it difficult to rule out certain biases, or they included too few cases from which to draw meaningful conclusions. And then there&rsquo;s the problem of detection bias: our ability to detect thyroid cancers has improved dramatically with the use of ultrasound technology. Very few studies have attempted to control for the shift in detection rates.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Utilizing the NCI Cohort Consortium, Dr. Kitahara was initially interested in exploring the possible effects of obesity and other lifestyle-related factors. In a pooled analysis of five prospective studies, she observed that the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21266520">risk of thyroid cancer was greater with increasing body mass index</a>. She also reported an inverse association between <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22843022">cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption</a><span> with thyroid cancer risk</span>, a finding consistent with earlier studies. She estimates that the increasing prevalence of obesity and decreasing smoking rates could explain about 40 percent of new thyroid cancer cases in the United States each year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The NCI Cohort Consortium data helped to establish obesity as a risk factor for thyroid cancer, identifying elevated risk for more aggressive types as well as death from the disease,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>Compared to most other malignancies, thyroid cancer is diagnosed more frequently in women and at earlier ages&mdash;however, there are few compelling hypotheses to explain these patterns. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been interested in evaluating whether hormonal influences in early life, especially the timing of puberty and pregnancy, may play a role in thyroid carcinogenesis,&rdquo; Dr. Kitahara said.</p>
<p>Dr. Kitahara has sought to identify additional datasets and populations with which to evaluate this novel hypothesis. In collaboration with investigators in Denmark, she demonstrated for the first time a <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24247722">positive association between childhood and adolescent measures of height and weight and risk of thyroid cancer in adulthood</a>. More recently, she launched investigations of perinatal characteristics and birth outcomes in relation to maternal and offspring thyroid cancer risk using data from a Nordic registry-based linkage study and two large cohort studies in Israel and the United Kingdom (<a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/linkage-newsletter/2016-07/research-publications/early-life-registries">see related Linkage article on early-life registries</a>). &ldquo;I&rsquo;m looking at various pregnancy characteristics and birth outcomes to determine whether they are related to risk of developing thyroid cancer later in life for the mother or her offspring,&rdquo; said Dr. Kitahara. She is also launching a new study to assess sex steroid hormones and thyroid function markers during pregnancy in relation to maternal thyroid cancer risk.</p>
<div class="callout-box" style="float: right; width: 30%; margin: 0 5px 10px 30px;">
<p>"There are still many hypotheses that have yet to be tested. The goal of this work is to identify individuals who might benefit from prevention or early detection efforts."</p>
</div>
<p>Understanding what factors might play a role in the etiology of thyroid cancer, particularly in view of the notable increase in incidence, has been a priority for Dr. Kitahara. In addition, she has collected descriptive data at the population level to study thyroid cancer incidence and mortality trends over time.</p>
<p>Dr. Kitahara recently led a <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/research-news-highlights/2017/thyroid-trends">landmark effort to evaluate long-term U.S. thyroid cancer incidence and mortality trends</a> using data from the Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results program. She and her colleagues observed substantial increases in thyroid cancer incidence and more modest, but statistically significant, increases in thyroid cancer mortality. The increases in thyroid cancer mortality were almost exclusively among patients diagnosed with advanced-stage papillary thyroid cancer, which has also increased in incidence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These findings are consistent with a true increase in the occurrence of the disease, which challenges the prevailing notion that rising thyroid cancer rates are solely related to over-diagnosis with newer screening techniques,&rdquo; Dr. Kitahara said. &ldquo;This is important, because it suggests there may be modifiable risk factors that are contributing to the increase.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her recent studies of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/m/pubmed/28397388/">thyroid cancer in high-risk patient populations, including organ transplant recipients</a>, individuals with a history of benign thyroid conditions, and cancer survivors, have specifically evaluated risks for advanced-stage thyroid cancers, as these are less likely to be influenced by detection bias. This approach has led to some interesting new findings, including a possible etiologic contribution from chronic kidney and liver disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The field has come a long way over the past decade,&rdquo; Dr. Kitahara said. &ldquo;Obesity and smoking appear to be important risk factors operating in opposite directions. They explain a large proportion of the increasing incidence. Other possibilities have emerged, including growth factors in early life and certain medical conditions, such as hyperthyroidism and chronic kidney disease; these need to be evaluated in greater detail. There are still many hypotheses that have yet to be tested. The goal of this work is to identify individuals who might benefit from prevention or early detection efforts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In February 2018, the DCEG communications team and Office of Education (OE) collaborated to deliver trainings to fellows on communicating with the media, designing and giving effective scientific posters, and giving scientific presentations. These offerings are a regular component of the Division training program for fellows.</p>
<p>The annual Fellows Media Training, delivered by Communications Chief <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=7&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=936140" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7253904" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="936140" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="936140">Jennifer Loukissas, M.P.P.</a>, focused on how to approach media inquiries to communicate research most effectively to science and health reporters. Ms. Loukissas discussed what motivates reporters and common questions, principles for giving a good interview and staying in control of the discussion, and suggestions for how to effectively communicate the main messages of a particular study.</p>
<p>Victoria Fisher, M.P.H., delivered the training on scientific posters, covering topics such as poster layout and best practices, and tips for interacting with colleagues who stop at your poster.</p>
<p>During the two-part presentation workshop, communications team members Ms. Fisher and Cora Hersh focused on building the content and &ldquo;story&rdquo; of a scientific talk, as well as tips for the delivery of the presentation. Diane Wigfield, of the OE, utilized her training in graphic design to offer the fellows guidance on designing slides to enhance a presentation and give it a more professional look. Participation from the fellows was encouraged throughout and included a brief video-taped presentation given at the start of the workshop, along with a personalized discussion on ways to improve their specific slides.</p>
<p>As researchers working for the federal government, DCEG fellows are expected to communicate their work in a variety of ways, including giving scientific talks at meetings and conferences. These trainings seek to prepare fellows to fully and effectively participate in the scientific community at DCEG and beyond.</p>

<p>New research from scientists at the National Cancer Institute and the Food and Drug Administration, Center for Tobacco Products, provides contemporary estimates of elevated risk of death from cancers known to be associated with tobacco among users of only cigars or pipes, as well as those who smoke only cigarettes. The findings were published online February 19, 2018, in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em>.</p>
<p>Using the National Longitudinal Mortality Study, investigators also identified elevated risk of dying from most examined causes of death, including cardiovascular and respiratory disease, among both current daily and non-daily cigarette smokers. Furthermore, the study showed an increased risk of death from all causes combined among current exclusive cigar smokers compared to never smokers.</p>
<p>This study adds to the limited existing body of research on the health effects of contemporary formulations of cigars and pipes, and provides evidence that exclusive use of cigars, pipes, or cigarettes, even nondaily cigarette use, each result in significant mortality risks. The findings underline the importance of smoking cessation to ultimately reduce the burden of death and disease caused by combustible tobacco use.</p>

<p>In March 2018, Wenyi Wang, Ph.D., Associate Professor in the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, visited DCEG to&nbsp;present a seminar and meet with staff. Dr. Wang, an expert in statistical bioinformatics, develops methods and software for measuring high-throughput genomic data and for personalized cancer risk prediction.</p>
<p>Dr. Wang&rsquo;s seminar, titled, &ldquo;Statistical methods for the deconvolution of high-throughput sequencing data from heterogeneous tumor samples,&rdquo; outlined her team&rsquo;s efforts to tackle a particularly thorny problem in tumor sample data analysis. When a sample of tissue is taken from a tumor, there are typically multiple types of cells present; for example, a breast cancer sample may contain fat cells and healthy breast cells in addition to the cancerous cells. These extra cell types can mask signals in data about the tumor, such as the gene expression profile. In order to get a clear picture of the gene expression of a particular tumor, it is important to understand the proportion of these various cell types present in the sample. Currently, this can be done using a technique called laser-capture microdissection, but it is expensive and time-consuming. Dr. Wang is developing time- and cost-saving statistical tools that allow scientists to estimate the proportions of different cells&mdash;or RNA and DNA from those cells&mdash;present in a tumor sample.</p>
<p>Validation with a variety of data sets is important to ensure the utility of such tools. Dr. Wang has worked with data from several studies and cancer types, ranging from manufactured cell lines with known proportions&mdash;the simplest validation method&mdash;to messier and more complex data sets from tumor samples. Her research has already shown the software can be used to improve signals when investigating associations between gene expressions and survival outcomes. Dr. Wang emphasized the need to develop tools that handle different cancer types individually, due to wide variation in the number and types of mutations involved.</p>
<p>Over the course of her visit, Dr. Wang met with investigators to discuss collaborations and research tools. She also discussed her research and gave career advice to fellows during a brown bag lunch.</p>

The two have worked together on projects related to predicting mutations and cancers in Li-Fraumeni syndrome, a rare inherited cancer syndrome.</p>

<p>In March 2018, Melissa Bondy, Ph.D., M.S., Professor in the Department of Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, Texas, spent two days at DCEG as a Visiting Scholar. Dr. Bondy is also Associate Director for Cancer Prevention and Population Sciences in the NCI-designated Dan L Duncan Cancer Center, holds the Dan L Duncan Professorship, and is a McNair Scholar at Baylor. An expert in genetic susceptibility and heritability for brain and breast cancer, Dr. Bondy has an additional strong interest in health disparities.</p>
<p>During her visit, Dr. Bondy met with several investigators and fellows to discuss research and collaborations. She also participated in two roundtable discussions. The first, &ldquo;Disparities and Cancer Epidemiology,&rdquo; was hosted by senior investigator <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=40&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349676" sys_contentid="349676" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349676" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275107">Sam Mbulaiteye, MBChB, M.Phil., M.Med.</a>, and postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=89&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1033198#Layne" sys_contentid="1033198#layne" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033198" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7275110">Tracy Layne, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a> The second, led by senior investigators <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=34&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349662" sys_contentid="349662" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349662" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275108">Ludmila Prokunina-Olsson, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=17&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349684" sys_contentid="349684" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349684" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275109">Sonja Berndt, Pharm.D., Ph.D.</a>, was titled &ldquo;Post-GWAS&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The highlight of the visit was her division-wide seminar, &ldquo;Glioma &ndash; Insights from molecular epidemiology to functional validation of glioma genes.&rdquo; For context, Dr. Bondy delved into the descriptive epidemiology of glioma, the most common malignant brain tumor. Nearly 24,000 new cases are predicted for 2018, accounting for 80 percent of cancerous brain tumors. Although glioma rates have remained relatively flat over time, the prognosis for this disease is generally poor, with a three-year mortality rate of 90 percent.</p>
<p>Dr. Bondy went on to describe known risk factors for glioma, including groundbreaking studies in this area. Some factors have been observed to be protective, including respiratory allergies and aspirin use. Others are established as increasing glioma risk. For example, radiation exposure is well understood as a risk factor, revealed through a study of individuals treated with x-rays to the head for the fungal infection ringworm. Dr. Bondy&rsquo;s particular area of interest, however, is characterizing genetic predisposition for glioma, including the risk associated with rare inherited syndromes.</p>
<p>In closing the seminar, Dr. Bondy reviewed ongoing efforts to study genetic risk in the Gliogene International Consortium, which she leads. Gliogene, the largest multi-national family study of glioma, uses a combination of functional genomics and case-control studies to find mutations associated with familial glioma. A major aspect of this research is the sequencing of families with two or more glioma cases to look for rare or novel mutations. In addition, a recent analysis of eight glioma genome-wide association studies identified 13 new risk loci. So far, the group has been able to explain just under 30 percent of familial glioma risk.</p>
<p>Over lunch and discussion with DCEG fellows, organized by postdoctoral fellows Dr. Layne and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=89&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1033198#Butler" sys_contentid="1033198#butler" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033198" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7275111">Ebone&eacute; Butler, Ph.D.</a>, Dr. Bondy addressed the importance of scientific innovation and gave advice on how to be productive while remaining politically astute to the needs and priorities of research teams. Dr. Butler reflected on the discussion, &ldquo;she has a deep passion and commitment to mentorship and training for early-stage cancer epidemiologists.&rdquo; Dr. Bondy encouraged the fellows to practice resilience and to remain steadfast towards their research goals over the inevitable highs and lows that will occur along the course of their careers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Michael Gottesman, M.D., NIH Deputy Director for Intramural Research, introduced Dr. Amundadottir and remarked on her considerable expertise and leadership in the field.</p>
<p>Dr. Amundadottir discussed results from pancreatic cancer GWAS, conducted within the NCI-led Pancreatic Cancer Cohort Consortium. This collaborative effort has identified over 20 common pancreatic cancer risk loci. During her talk, Dr. Amundadottir highlighted the genomic and functional characterization of a subset of these loci. Her research focuses on identifying the role of these genetic alterations in a wide range of processes including telomere maintenance, RNA surveillance, and pancreatic cancer development and homeostasis.</p>

<p>Researchers at the National Cancer Institute have shown that people who engage in more minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity enjoy health benefits (measured here by likelihood of dying during the study period), but it does not matter how those minutes are accumulated. Doing more activity in short increments of time had similar benefits to exercising in increments of 10 minutes at a time or more. Moderate physical activity is defined as brisk walking, or slow jogging. The findings were published Thursday, March 22, 2018, in the <em>Journal of the American Heart Association</em>.</p>
<p>Post-doctoral fellow <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=89&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1033198#Saint-Maurice" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033198" sys_relationshipid="7276164" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1033198#saint-maurice">Pedro Saint-Maurice, Ph.D.</a>, and colleagues, compared accelerometer-measured physical activity in roughly 5,000 adults aged 40 and older who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, a nationally representative study, and followed them prospectively over seven years. When they compared participants with lower or higher numbers of minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity, they determined that the increments in which those minutes were accumulated, in bursts of 10 minutes, 5 minutes, or even shorter, resulted in the same statistically-significant reductions in risk of death over the study period. Similar to findings from previous studies, they observed increasing health benefit with increasing minutes of exercise recorded by the accelerometer. This study evaluated risk for death from any cause; future research is needed to determine if the benefits of 150 minutes/week of moderate physical activity accumulated at any incremental duration can apply to specific health outcomes, such as cancer incidence, or cancer-specific mortality. The <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/dcpc/prevention/policies_practices/physical_activity/guidelines.htm">2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</a> states, &ldquo;for substantial health benefits, adults should do at least 150 minutes a week of moderate-intensity aerobic activity.&rdquo;</p>

Coleman, Jr., Ph.D., Minority Health and Health Disparities Research Innovation Award for her proposal, &ldquo;Evaluating the Associations of Symptom Appraisal and Barriers to Care with Endometrial Cancer Presentation and Outcomes in a Diverse Population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This $15,000 award, coordinated by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), will support Dr. Clarke&rsquo;s investigations into the biological and behavioral aspects underlying disparities in endometrial cancer incidence and mortality. African-American women are twice as likely to die from endometrial cancer as white American women, despite a lower incidence rate. Among other goals, Dr. Clarke aims to understand whether differing patterns of healthcare access are contributing to disparities in endometrial cancer survival; the five-year survival rate for early stage cancer is 95 percent&nbsp;and only 45 percent&nbsp;for late stage-disease. She will also evaluate tampon-based sampling for early detection of endometrial cancer in underserved populations. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to NIMHD, this selective award program is designed to support the development of innovative research ideas and concepts, contributed by postdoctoral fellows, staff scientists, and staff clinicians, that have the potential for high impact in any area of minority health and health disparities research. It is named in honor of William G. Coleman Jr., Ph.D., who became the first permanent African-American scientific director in the history of the NIH Intramural Research Program in January 2011 when he was appointed to direct the NIMHD Intramural Research Program.</p>

<p>In a new study from the National Cancer Institute and Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, researchers report an association between diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis (<span>inflammation of the thyroid gland</span>), two benign thyroid conditions, and increased risk of differentiated thyroid cancer. The study was published online March 23, 2018, in the <em>Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism</em>.</p>
<p>Previous epidemiologic studies have found that certain benign thyroid conditions, such as benign thyroid nodules, adenoma (a benign tumor), and goiter (swelling in the neck resulting from an enlarged thyroid gland) are associated with thyroid cancer risk. However, there was little evidence as to whether thyroid dysfunction and thyroid autoimmunity influence risk.</p>
<p><a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/kitahara-cari">Cari Kitahara, Ph.D.</a>, and colleagues prospectively examined a wide range of benign thyroid conditions and risk of differentiated thyroid cancer using data for the period 1978-2013 from nationwide hospital and cancer registries in Denmark. They found an unexpected increased risk of differentiated thyroid cancer, including regional/distant disease, following diagnosis of hyperthyroidism and thyroiditis that could not be solely attributed to increased medical surveillance. Patients diagnosed with goiter and adenoma also had an increased risk of differentiated thyroid cancer, while hypothyroidism was less clearly associated with thyroid cancer risk.</p>
<p>This work provides important new evidence on risk factors for thyroid cancer. While the results support a possible role of thyroid dysfunction and autoimmunity in thyroid cancer development, further investigation is needed to better understand the underlying biological mechanisms.</p>

This award, among the highest granted by the Department, recognizes Dr. Linet&rsquo;s decades of international leadership in epidemiology. During her thirty years at the NCI, she has conducted groundbreaking research on the epidemiology of leukemia, lymphoma, and brain tumors, and the effects of radiation and benzene on cancer incidence and mortality.</p>
<p>Dr. Linet&rsquo;s studies of workers exposed to benzene contributed evidence to set standards for workplace safety. She established and has led the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study, which has provided invaluable information on the risks to medical professionals of low-dose ionizing radiation from traditional and emergent technology procedures. In addition, Dr. Linet has been a driving force in several international research consortia, including InterLymph and the International Childhood Cancer Consortium, which have led to new insights into cancer etiology.</p>
<p>In conjunction with her personal research program, Dr. Linet served the epidemiology research community as Chief of REB for 12 years, and as a member of the National Academy of Sciences Nuclear and Radiation Studies Board for six years, among many other distinguished professional contributions.</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>A new analysis by scientists at NCI evaluates nine different individualized lung cancer risk prediction models based on their selections of ever-smokers for computed tomography (CT) lung cancer screening. The paper, published on May 15 in <em>Annals of Internal Medicine</em>, compares the ever-smoker populations chosen for screening by each model to provide guidance on which models could be considered for recommendation by future screening guidelines.</p>
<p>Earlier studies performed by this research group and others have demonstrated that using individualized lung cancer risk models to offer screening to ever-smokers could save more lives, and do so more effectively and efficiently, than current USPSTF recommendations. These existing recommendations are based only on age and smoking history. The 2018 National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines in the U.S. now permit the use of individualized risk models, which take into account a variety of demographic and clinical factors. However, several such models are available for use, and their performance had not previously been compared.</p>
<p>A team of researchers, led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=18&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349618" sys_contentid="349618" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349618" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7278083" sys_variantid="1965">Hormuzd Katki, Ph.D.</a>, estimated the populations chosen for screening by nine existing lung cancer risk models using data from the 2010-2012 National Health Interview Survey, a representative sample of the US population. They also compared the models&rsquo; statistical performance in two cohorts of ever-smokers: more than 330,000 in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, and more than 70,000 in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Survey Cohort.</p>
<p>The researchers found wide variation in the size and demographics of the U.S. screening population selected by each model, which ranged from 7.6 million to 26 million ever-smokers. These disagreements occurred because of the differing statistical performance of the models: four of the models estimated lung cancer risk accurately on average, but four other models substantially overestimated lung cancer risk. The remaining model&rsquo;s performance fell in between that of the four most accurate and four least accurate models.&nbsp;The four top-performing risk models also selected similar numbers of ever-smokers for screening, and&nbsp;they distinguished best between individuals who would develop lung cancer and those who would not. However,&nbsp;even the&nbsp;top models&nbsp;disagreed on how to estimate risk for different racial or ethnic subgroups, which is an important area of future research.</p>
<p>The top models in this analysis are the Bach model, PLCO<sub>M2012</sub>, the Lung Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (LCRAT), and the Lung Cancer Death Risk Assessment Tool (LCDRAT) (the latter two were developed by authors of this study). The team hopes this analysis will inform future lung cancer screening guidelines to recommend using individualized risk models to select ever-smokers for CT lung cancer screening.</p>

<p>In April 2018, DCEG welcomed Robert Burk, M.D., Professor at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, as the inaugural Sholom Wacholder Distinguished Lecturer in Quantitative Health Sciences. The lectureship is named in memory of Sholom Wacholder, Ph.D., senior investigator in the Biostatistics Branch (BB), a brilliant, multidisciplinary and critical thinker who worked at the intersection of quantitative reasoning and science. He passed away in 2015.</p>
<p>Dr. Burk was selected because of his close personal and professional relationship with Dr. Wacholder&mdash;the two collaborated for decades. During the talk, titled, &ldquo;Sholom, Mark and me &ndash; Natural history of type-specific cervicovaginal HPV infections,&rdquo; Dr. Burk discussed his friend&rsquo;s intellect and curiosity, as well as his legacy. He went on to describe the decades-long progress of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical cancer research, to which both he and Dr. Wacholder have greatly contributed. These advances depended on a range of efforts, from early studies dealing with immature HPV tests, to epidemiologic studies demonstrating that infection persistence drives progression to cancer, to more recent genomic studies of the carcinogenicity of HPV variants and sublineages.</p>

<p>In the United States, incidence of lung cancer historically has been higher in men than in women, reflecting differences in smoking patterns. Previous studies had suggested a shift in this pattern. Using lung cancer incidence data from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries and smoking behavior data from the National Health Interview Survey, researchers at the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute confirmed a reversal of this pattern among younger non-Hispanic whites and Hispanic whites born since the mid-1960s (aged 30-49 years at diagnosis). Their findings were published online in the <em>New England Journal of Medicine</em> on May 24, 2018.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sex-specific differences in smoking behaviors do not seem to account adequately for this shift: prevalence of smoking in non-Hispanic and Hispanic white women only approached and never exceeded that of their male counterparts. A closer look at the histological types revealed a higher rate of adenocarcinoma among younger women, compared to men; risk for this lung cancer type decreases more slowly after smoking cessation than others.</p>
<p>These findings may indicate a future with higher lung cancer burden in women and highlights the need to intensify anti-tobacco efforts to decrease smoking in young women. Further investigation into sex-specific lung cancer risks is needed through continued monitoring as well as etiologic studies to determine the factors contributing to the emerging excess of lung cancer incidence in young women.</p>

Dr. Tucker led a superbly productive program of epidemiologic and interdisciplinary studies with innovative clinical and laboratory components. Her landmark scientific contributions have substantively improved our understanding of the mechanisms underlying familial cancers and predisposition to multiple malignancies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy&rsquo;s service to the NCI and NIH has been extraordinary,&rdquo; said DCEG Director <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" sys_contentid="349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349630" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276389">Stephen J. Chanock, M.D.</a> &ldquo;Her epidemiologic, genetic, and clinical skills, as well as her compassion, wisdom, and patience as a leader, have made a lasting impact on our research program.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A graduate of Wellesley College, Dr. Tucker received her M.D. from Harvard Medical School and completed training in internal medicine and medical oncology at Stanford University Medical Center. She joined NIH in 1978 as a commissioned officer in the U.S. Public Health Service (PHS). From the establishment of DCEG as a Division, Dr. Tucker has been instrumental in the scientific management of its research programs. She served as Chief of the Family Studies Section of the Environmental Epidemiology Branch from 1987-1992, Chief of the Genetic Epidemiology Branch (GEB) from 1992-2011, Director of the Human Genetics Program since 2005, and Acting Director of DCEG between 2012-2013.</p>
<p>As Chief of GEB, Dr. Tucker guided the Branch&rsquo;s work in the identification of the clinical features of patients carrying pathogenic variants in several major cancer susceptibility genes, including <em>NF1</em> and <em>NF2</em> (neurofibromatosis types I and II),<em> BRCA1 </em>and <em>BRCA2 </em>(breast and ovarian cancers), <em>PTEN </em>(Cowden&rsquo;s disease, with breast cancer), <em>TP53 </em>(Li-Fraumeni syndrome), and <em>PTCH</em> (nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome). These discoveries have allowed scientists to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms of carcinogenesis in these disorders.</p>
<p>Dr. Tucker has been at the forefront of melanoma research over the past four decades and is widely recognized as one of the world&rsquo;s leading genetic epidemiologists. Her research team and collaborators identified the first major susceptibility genes for melanoma (<em>CDKN2A </em>and <em>CDK4</em>) and developed clinical guidelines for the care of high-risk individuals, including training videos. They published an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12115352">atlas of lesions in melanoma-prone families</a> in 2002, and more recently launched a website with the <a href="https://analysistools.nci.nih.gov/nevustool/">first-ever serial collection of dysplastic nevi and melanomas</a><span>,</span> documenting skin changes over nearly four decades of clinical follow-up. In addition, Dr. Tucker developed a web-based <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/melanomarisktool/">calculator to estimate an individual&rsquo;s risk of developing melanoma</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Tucker also pioneered research on the late adverse effects of cancer therapy. She played a major role in the first epidemiologic studies in the 1980s demonstrating that both chemotherapy and radiotherapy contribute to risk of subsequent leukemia and solid malignancies. Her rigorous approach &ndash; carefully documenting the complex, cumulative therapeutic exposures patients received &ndash; laid the foundation for later large-scale epidemiologic studies, particularly of childhood cancer survivors, in the United States and Europe.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy&rsquo;s major discoveries in genetic susceptibility to cancer as well as late adverse effects of therapy have substantially impacted the care and surveillance of many cancer patients,&rdquo; said <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349664" sys_contentid="349664" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349664" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276390">Robert Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.</a>, Director of the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program.</p>
<p>As Director of the Human Genetics Program, Dr. Tucker has been responsible for the scientific and administrative direction of a broad interdisciplinary program of family-based and population-based studies across the Integrative Tumor Epidemiology and Clinical Genetics Branches as well as the Laboratory of Translational Genomics. She has also played a role in overseeing the NCI Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory.</p>
<p>Dr. Tucker is the recipient of many prestigious awards recognizing her exceptional scientific contributions, including the PHS Distinguished Service Medal, the Oncology Nursing Society/Adria Excellence in Publication Award in Clinical Practice, the International Association of Business Communicators DC Metro Chapter Silver Inkwell Award for &ldquo;<a href="https://www.cancer.gov/types/skin/anyone-can-get-skin-cancer">Anyone Can Get Skin Cancer</a>,&rdquo; an NIH Director&rsquo;s Award, an NIH Merit Award, the NIH Plain Language Award, the NCI Outstanding Mentor Award, the inaugural DCEG Exemplary Service Award, and was a General Motors Visiting Professor. At the recent DCEG Town Hall Meeting, she received a DCEG Special Appreciation Award to recognize her 40 years of tremendous service to the Division.</p>
<p>Dr. Tucker&rsquo;s tireless dedication to NCI and the broader research community is widely recognized. She has generously given her time to innumerable requests for service on various committees and working groups. The author of more than 300 publications, as well as approximately 50 editorials, commentaries, and book chapters, she has served on several editorial boards for leading scientific journals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peggy has a remarkable track record of scientific accomplishment, compassionate clinical care, and selfless service,&rdquo; said <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349665" sys_contentid="349665" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349665" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276391">Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D.,</a> Scientist Emeritus, DCEG. &ldquo;Her inspired leadership and mentoring along with her tireless advocacy for women scientists have paved the way for the next generation of researchers across the Division and beyond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She has been an enduring champion for both women and men in science. During her stellar career, Dr. Tucker initiated and expanded numerous projects that she subsequently gave to junior scientists to help further their growth and development into successful principal investigators. As an exemplary clinician, she has shared her medical expertise and insights with many junior clinicians, enabling them to establish their own clinical careers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is difficult to find a DCEG scientist whose career or scientific development has not been assisted by Dr. Tucker&rsquo;s generosity and selflessness, directly or indirectly, through advice, encouragement, support, guidance, and opportunities,&rdquo; said <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=30&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349616" sys_contentid="349616" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349616" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7276392">Lindsay Morton, Ph.D.</a>, a senior investigator in DCEG&rsquo;s Radiation Epidemiology Branch and one of Dr. Tucker&rsquo;s mentees. &ldquo;She is an irreplaceable mentor and role model to me and many others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Tucker remains committed to DCEG. Recently named as a Scientist Emerita by the NIH Scientific Directors, she plans to continue providing crucial scientific advice for ongoing studies in several important research areas, mentor junior investigators, and offer valuable management insights to DCEG&rsquo;s leadership team.</p>

<p>Tenure-track investigator <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/hofmann-jonathan">Jonathan Hofmann, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, has established a research program in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch focused on the role of agricultural exposures in the etiology of multiple myeloma and other cancers, and on understanding the biological mechanisms that influence the development and progression of multiple myeloma.</p>
<p>Multiple myeloma is a cancer&nbsp;that affects plasma cells, a type of white blood cell that produces antibodies to fight infection and disease. Despite recent advances in treatment, the prognosis for multiple myeloma remains unfavorable, with an estimated five-year relative survival rate of approximately 50 percent. Although it is a rare cancer, African Americans are twice as likely to be diagnosed compared to Americans of European ancestry; the reasons for this disparity and the etiology of this malignancy remain unclear.</p>
<p>A unique feature of multiple myeloma is that it is almost always preceded by a largely asymptomatic condition called monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS). People with MGUS have about a one-percent per year chance of progressing to multiple myeloma.</p>
<p>In addition to MGUS and race/ethnicity, other factors known to increase a person&rsquo;s likelihood of developing this cancer include increasing age, male sex, severe immune dysregulation, and obesity.</p>
<h3>Agricultural Exposures and Multiple Myeloma</h3>
<p>Dr. Hofmann and colleagues are building on evidence that certain agricultural exposures may also influence the risk of multiple myeloma. An excess of this cancer has been consistently observed among farmers and other agricultural workers in studies worldwide over the past 30 years. However, there is little clarity about the magnitude of the risk, or the specific exposures that contribute to these observations.</p>
<p>Dr. Hofmann is leading a major molecular epidemiologic investigation within the <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/research/who-we-study/cohorts/agricultural-health-study">Agricultural Health Study</a> (AHS)&mdash;known as the Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect in Agriculture (BEEA) study&mdash;to explore the relationships between agricultural exposures and intermediate biomarkers related to multiple myeloma and other cancers.</p>
<p>BEEA launched in 2010 and over the past several years has enrolled nearly 1,700 pesticide applicators and 200 controls. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve just completed the field data collection effort,&rdquo; Dr. Hofmann said. &ldquo;One of the main questions we&rsquo;re trying to address in BEEA is whether there is also an excess risk of MGUS among this population.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During home visits, BEEA participants were interviewed about recent agricultural exposures and provided blood, urine, buccal cell, and house dust samples. Investigators selected individuals who had completed all of the previous AHS questionnaires, so they have a comprehensive lifetime history of occupational exposures to pesticides and other agricultural exposures. In addition, they chose participants over the age of 50, in part because MGUS is rarely detected among younger individuals.</p>
<p>Dr. Hofmann noted, &ldquo;the updated information and biospecimens, coupled with the lifetime history of pesticide use obtained within the AHS, provide an unprecedented opportunity to conduct mechanistic studies of important chemicals used in agriculture and other settings that are linked to cancer.&rdquo; He and collaborators are now poised to take advantage of this important resource.</p>
<p>In a previous analysis of AHS samples from a separate, smaller sub-study, Dr. Ola Landgren, now at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, and colleagues observed a two-fold excess risk of MGUS compared to a demographically similar population. Dr. Hofmann is following up and extending this important finding within BEEA by characterizing the prevalence of MGUS and investigating associations with specific pesticides and other agricultural exposures with almost three times the number of samples as the previous analysis.</p>
<p>In addition, he and postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/oeeb-fellows#Shearer">Joe Shearer, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, are conducting a special effort within BEEA to investigate hematologic alterations among participants with serial blood samples collected before and after exposure to permethrin, a widely-used insecticide that has been associated with an increased risk of multiple myeloma in the AHS. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re looking at select immunologic markers that have previously been associated with multiple myeloma, and we&rsquo;re trying to understand whether these markers are altered after permethrin exposure,&rdquo; Dr. Hofmann said.</p>
<h3>Thinking Beyond Multiple Myeloma</h3>
<p>Agricultural exposures&mdash;including pesticides, bioaerosols such as endotoxin (a component of the cell wall of gram-negative bacteria), diesel exhaust, and viral and bacterial exposures related to livestock and poultry&mdash;have been associated with risk of various other cancers, although the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are generally not well understood.</p>
<p>Dr. Hofmann and colleagues have published two papers reporting initial findings from BEEA, including the first comprehensive investigation of lung cancer-related immune markers among endotoxin-exposed farmers. Farmers raising hogs in confined facilities are often highly exposed to endotoxin, which provokes an acute inflammatory response. Furthermore, occupational exposure to endotoxin has been consistently associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. In this new study, Dr. Hofmann and colleagues found that circulating levels of a macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC/CCL22), a chemokine that has been prospectively linked to lung cancer development, were significantly reduced among hog farmers; several other endotoxin-related immunological markers were elevated. These findings provide insights into the potential mechanisms of action through which endotoxin prevents lung carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>In the second paper, led by postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/oeeb-fellows#Lerro">Catherine Lerro, Ph.D.</a>, investigators observed associations between long-term occupational exposure to certain pesticides, thyroid hormone levels, and subclinical hypothyroidism.</p>
<p>In the long-term, BEEA will serve as a biorepository for cross-sectional molecular epidemiologic studies to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying associations between agricultural exposures and various cancers or other chronic diseases.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While much of my current work is focused on multiple myeloma and MGUS, we plan to look at many different types of exposures and health outcomes,&rdquo; Dr. Hofmann said. &ldquo;The data and biospecimens collected in BEEA will serve as a critical resource for future studies.&rdquo; Investigators will evaluate targeted hypotheses and broader, agnostic questions using selected &ldquo;omic&rdquo; platforms related to pesticides and other agricultural exposures.</p>

<p>To date, the only established modifiable risk factor for multiple myeloma is obesity; Dr. Hofmann has contributed to our understanding that excess body weight throughout adult life influences risk. He is tapping a number of existing epidemiologic cohorts to look for biomarkers associated with obesity and both the development and progression of multiple myeloma.</p>
<p>It has been hypothesized that the association between excess body weight and multiple myeloma could be due to reduced expression of adiponectin; circulating levels of this anti-inflammatory hormone are typically lower in obese individuals compared to those with normal body weight. In support of this hypothesis, Dr. Hofmann and colleagues observed inverse associations with multiple myeloma for circulating adiponectin levels in a nested case-control study in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial. Subsequently, they confirmed these results in a larger pooled investigation including six additional cohorts in the NCI Cohort Consortium. In another effort, they observed lower levels of adiponectin in patients with smoldering or active multiple myeloma compared to those with MGUS, suggesting that reduced expression of adiponectin may be associated with myeloma progression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our results provide the strongest epidemiologic evidence to date that adiponectin may be associated with risk of developing multiple myeloma,&rdquo; Dr. Hofmann said. &ldquo;These findings may have implications for the clinical management of overweight and obese individuals, in particular for those with the precursor MGUS.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He notes that in the recent Cohort Consortium analysis, adiponectin levels were lower among African Americans compared to those of European ancestry, after controlling for body mass index and other factors. Dr. Hofmann plans to expand on these intriguing findings with additional studies in cohorts with a greater proportion of African American participants. &ldquo;This will facilitate future analyses stratified by race and will allow us to investigate differences in adiponectin levels and observed racial disparities in multiple myeloma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Severe immune dysregulation has also been reported as a risk factor for multiple myeloma. For example, risk is substantially elevated among solid organ transplant recipients receiving immunosuppressive medications and among HIV/AIDS patients. Researchers suspect that subclinical immune changes or disturbances may be associated with myeloma risk in the general population.</p>
<p>Despite strong experimental and clinical evidence that certain immunologic biomarkers are involved in multiple myeloma pathogenesis, few prospective studies to date have investigated them. Within PLCO, Dr. Hofmann is analyzing circulating immunologic markers among MGUS and multiple myeloma cases and MGUS-free controls; he presented preliminary findings at the 2018 AACR Annual Meeting.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our primary aim in this study is to identify circulating chemokines and angiogenic cytokines associated with future risk of multiple myeloma,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Beyond that, we want to get a better understanding of how and when these markers influence myeloma development, and whether they are involved in earlier or later stages of the disease process. We&rsquo;re also evaluating whether these markers can help predict the likelihood of progression from MGUS to multiple myeloma.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A distinctive feature of this effort is that investigators are studying subjects with MGUS status characterized at baseline, including those with MGUS who did or did not subsequently develop multiple myeloma. This work was made possible due to an ongoing collaboration with Dr. Landgren to identify MGUS in a large sample of PLCO participants and evaluate characteristics associated with progression.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s a great deal of interest in improving our ability to identify MGUS patients at high risk of progression to myeloma,&rdquo; Dr. Hofmann said. &ldquo;I feel lucky to have the opportunity to do the molecular studies on multiple myeloma, and our studies on biomarkers related to progression. It&rsquo;s a fascinating area, and there may be translational implications in terms of how MGUS patients are managed, and potential opportunities for secondary prevention.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Decades of improvements in cancer prevention and treatment have resulted in declining cancer mortality rates&mdash;about 1.5 percent decline per year since 1999 (NCI Annual Report to the Nation, 2018). Despite this progress, overall mortality rates in U.S. adults have leveled off, or in some cases, even increased. These trends stand in stark contrast to those of nearly every other high-income nation, including Canada and the U.K., where premature mortality rates have steadily fallen. Driven by the pressing need to understand the causes of this disconcerting trend and to inform public health interventions, DCEG scientists are spearheading the Premature Mortality Project&mdash;an interdisciplinary, multi-institutional effort to characterize these trends. In the process, the team has uncovered distinct differences by race, ethnicity, age, and region, and provided crucial information about the ongoing, well-publicized, drug overdose epidemic.</p>

<h3>Experts in Intricate Analyses</h3>
<p>The Premature Mortality Project team uses publicly available data, such as from death certificates, but their unique combination of skills and expertise allows them to draw new insights. In DCEG, descriptive epidemiology and cancer surveillance have been a core piece of the research portfolio for decades. Throughout their groundbreaking efforts to track diseases like lung and breast cancer, Division staff have carefully honed the tools to describe disease and death trends in detail.</p>

<p>One key tool DCEG epidemiologists bring to the table is the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=856668" sys_contentid="856668" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="856668" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7275607">age-period-cohort model</a>. Although the method has existed for a long time, DCEG scientists have more recently played an important role in making it accessible for a variety of applications. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349657" sys_contentid="349657" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349657" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275605">Philip Rosenberg, Ph.D.</a>, senior investigator in the Biostatistics Branch (BB), explained, &ldquo;this complex statistical technique allows us to distinguish the natural effects of aging&mdash;after all, older people die at a higher rate than younger people&mdash;from any potential increases in mortality from one generation to the next. In addition, statistical models provide a way to quantify the uncertainty involved in separating these two effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Using national mortality data also allows the team to conduct work that is as &ldquo;real-time&rdquo; as it gets in epidemiology; they can respond relatively quickly to questions their own work uncovers, as well as to the national discussion of these issues. Although the most recently-available death certificate data tends to be two or three years old, this remains a faster turnaround than that of other complex projects, since the team does not have to collect participant surveys or clinical evaluations. An agile research program is especially critical when investigating a problem evolving as rapidly as premature mortality trends in the U.S.</p>
<h3>Mortality Rate Overview</h3>
<p>The project&rsquo;s flagship paper, published at the beginning of 2017, was a comprehensive look at U.S. trends in premature mortality by sex, race/ethnicity, age, and cause of death (Shiels et al., 2017a). &ldquo;The overall premature death rate is an average of increases and decreases in death rates across different parts of the population,&rdquo; said lead author <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1052540" sys_contentid="1052540" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1052540" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7275606">Meredith Shiels, Ph.D.</a>, investigator in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch. &ldquo;We need to identify which segments of the population have premature death rates that are worsening, staying the same, or improving, and which causes of death are responsible for these changes over time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This study, which used death certificate data from the National Centers for Health Statistics, revealed major differences in premature mortality trends. Death rates for Hispanics, blacks, and Asian/Pacific Islanders (A/PI) have declined, driven by reduced deaths from cancer, heart disease, and HIV/AIDS&mdash;reflecting public health efforts to reduce tobacco use, as well as advances in diagnosis and treatment. However, rates of premature mortality have risen among certain age groups of whites and American Indians/Alaska Natives (AI/AN). Most alarmingly, overall mortality rates for white and AI/ANs individuals aged 20-30 increased by two to five percent per year over the past decade, a rate virtually unheard of in high-income nations. Suicide and liver disease contributed to the increases in these groups, but the primary contributor was accidental deaths, mainly drug overdoses. This finding lent additional weight to previous, widely-publicized reports of a growing opioid epidemic in the U.S.</p>
<p>To put the U.S. trends in context, the investigators compared these rates to those in England, Wales, and Canada. They found that premature deaths in those latter countries are on the decline in nearly all age groups, further highlighting the uniqueness of the U.S. mortality increases.</p>

<p>Informed by the broad picture that the initial paper painted, the team decided to drill down on areas of particular public health concern. In December 2017, Drs. Shiels, Freedman, and Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez collaborated with David Thomas, Ph.D., of NIDA, to publish an analysis of drug overdose deaths (Shiels et al., 2017b). They disaggregated overdose deaths by race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Hispanic) and by type of drug. &ldquo;Rising opioid deaths among non-Hispanic white Americans have received a great deal of national media attention. Recently, however, reports have indicated increases in drug overdose deaths for non-Hispanic black and Hispanic Americans as well. We wanted to better characterize these patterns to help inform targets for intervention,&rdquo; said Dr. Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez.</p>
<p>In fact, while the study confirmed strong increases over time for opioid-related overdose deaths in nearly all age groups of non-Hispanic whites, opioid deaths have also risen in both non-Hispanic black and Hispanic populations. Furthermore, the authors identified an epidemic of cocaine overdose deaths, primarily among non-Hispanic black men and women, that rivals deaths from opioids. Between 2012 and 2015, cocaine overdose deaths were almost as common among non-Hispanic black men as prescription opioid deaths among non-Hispanic white men, and slightly more common among non-Hispanic black women than deaths from heroin overdose among non-Hispanic white women. &ldquo;Our findings stress the necessity of strategies to combat the U.S. prescription opioid, heroin, and fentanyl epidemics for all racial and ethnic groups,&rdquo; said Dr. Shiels. &ldquo;Additionally, this analysis suggests the need for additional public health efforts to prevent cocaine-related deaths, which disproportionally affect older, non-Hispanic black persons.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>Future Research</h3>
<p>Several more analyses are in the works to expand on issues highlighted by these recent studies. For example, one important line of investigation is using age-period-cohort modeling to produce projections of premature mortality in the U.S. through 2030. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=171&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302619#Best" sys_contentid="302619#best" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302619" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7275608">Ana Best, Ph.D.</a>, a postdoctoral fellow in BB who has been contributing to the Premature Mortality Project, has a particularly significant role in this effort. Another analysis compares rates of drug poisoning deaths by county, socioeconomic status, and rurality, to explore whether the prevailing narrative that the opioid epidemic principally affects lower-income, rural areas, stands up to statistical rigor. The team is also comparing drug poisoning deaths between the U.S. and other countries, as well as tracking trends in very premature (under 25 years old) death rates.</p>

</div>
<p>Studies like the ones produced by the Premature Mortality Project have chronicled the epidemic of drug overdose, particularly opioids, in the U.S. These data have sparked a concerted effort to find solutions to this multifaceted public health emergency. For example, in 2017, the Department of Health and Human Services awarded over $800 million in grants to support opioid addiction treatment, prevention, and recovery. The President&rsquo;s proposed 2019 budget adds another bolus of funding to increase the availability of overdose-reversing drugs. In addition to helping direct public health interventions to those who need it most, future descriptive studies will be essential to evaluate the impact of those interventions.</p>

<h4><strong>Physical Activity</strong></h4>
<p>Two reports based on the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003-2006 accelerometer records in adults and mortality data collected through 2011 evaluated benefits of types of physical activity in relation to all-cause mortality. The total volume of physical activity, rather than intensity, seems to be the key driver in reducing the risk for all‐cause mortality. The difference in mortality benefits associated with moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity are only modest in comparison to light physical activity after accounting for the volume of physical activity. In addition, sporadic and bouted moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity was similarly and strongly associated with mortality risk. Mortality risk reductions associated with moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity are independent of how activity is accumulated. (Saint-Maurice PF, Troiano RP, Berrigan D, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29610219">Volume of light versus moderate-to-vigorous physical activity: Similar benefits for all-cause mortality?</a> J Am Heart Assoc 2018; Epub Apr 2.

<h4><strong>Inflammatory Proteins</strong></h4>
<p>Investigators examined circulating inflammatory proteins and overall survival among gallbladder cancer (GBC) cases from population-based studies in Shanghai and Chile. Of 49 evaluable proteins, eight were significantly associated with overall survival among the Shanghai cases: seven were associated with a poorer survival, and the highest levels of tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) were associated with an increase in survival. No substantial difference in the magnitude of the association was observed between early- and late-stages of GBC. Of seven proteins, five were validated in the patients from Chile. Reducing inflammation and targeting pathways associated with increased survival might improve outcomes. The potential for using a TRAIL-related anticancer drug for gallbladder cancer treatment merits further investigation. (Liu Z, Kemp TJ, Gao YT, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29618736">Circulating levels of inflammatory proteins and survival in patients with gallbladder cancer.</a> Sci Rep 2018)</p>

<h4><strong>Physical Activity</strong></h4>
<p>Using data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort, investigators examined physical activity patterns over the life course in relation to risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Compared to persons with consistently low physical activity patterns, those who maintained activity levels over time had a 26-36% lower risk of liver cancer and those who increased physical activity over time had no associations with risk, while those who decreased activity over time had a non-significantly higher risk of liver cancer. The results suggest that sustained physical activity is associated with lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma, while increasing physical activity later in life may not yield the same benefit. (Arem H, Loftfield E, Saint-Maurice PF, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29533015">Physical activity across the lifespan and liver cancer incidence in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study cohort.</a> Cancer Med 2018; Epub Mar 13.)</p>

<h4><strong>Tobacco and Alcohol</strong></h4>
<p>While tobacco and alcohol are established risk factors for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of primary liver cancer, it is unknown whether they also increase the risk of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC). Data from the Liver Cancer Pooling Project, a consortium of 14 US-based prospective cohort studies that includes data from 1,518,741 individuals (HCC n&thinsp;=&thinsp;1423, ICC n&thinsp;=&thinsp;410), showed that current smoking was associated with 47&ndash;86% increased HCC and ICC risks, while increasing years since smoking cessation was associated inversely with HCC risk only. Heavy alcohol consumption was associated with 68&ndash;87% increased HCC and ICC risks. Light or moderate alcohol consumption (i.e., &lt;3 drinks per day) was associated with a decreased HCC, but not ICC, risk. A positive multiplicative interaction was observed between heavy alcohol consumption and diabetes with HCC risk. (Petrick JL, Campbell PT, Koshiol J, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29520041">Tobacco, alcohol use and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma: The Liver Cancer Pooling Project.</a> Br J Cancer 2018; Epub Mar 9.)</p>

<h4><strong>Microbiome Stability</strong></h4>
<p>Identifying which alterations of microbial populations or functions contribute to disease, treatment response, or remission will hinge on comparisons of specimens that are collected prospectively. Researchers conducting prospective studies need to consider temporal variation in microbiome measurements. Analyses were performed on 16S rRNA profiles in paired specimens from various body sites separated by six months from three studies. Interclass correlation coefficients for temporal stability were generally 0.5 or below for the majority of the phylum-level relative abundances and alpha-diversity metrics across different types of specimens. This finding implies that even nominally significant associations with these unstable metrics should be interpreted with caution and that sample sizes need to be quite large for these types of analyses. In contrast, unweighted UniFrac, one measure of beta diversity, was relatively stable not only for stool specimens but also for oral, oropharynx, and vagina specimens. (Sinha R, Goedert JJ, Vogtmann F, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29608646">Quantification of human microbiome stability over six months: Implications for epidemiologic studies.</a> Am J Epidemiol 2018; Epub Mar 28)</p>

<h4><strong>Whole-Genome Amplified DNA</strong></h4>
<p>The recommended genomic DNA input requirements for whole-genome single nucleotide polymorphism microarrays can limit the scope of molecular epidemiological studies. Investigators performed a large-scale evaluation of whole-genome amplified DNA as input into high-density, whole-genome Illumina&reg; Infinium&reg; SNP microarray. Overall, 6,622 DNA samples from 5,970 individuals were obtained from three distinct biospecimen sources and genotyped using gDNA and/or wgaDNA inputs. When genotypes from the same individual were compared with standard, native gDNA input amount, there was 99.94% mean concordance with wgaDNA input. The results demonstrate that carefully conducted studies with wgaDNA inputs can yield high-quality genotyping results. These findings should enable investigators to consider expansion of ongoing studies using high-density SNP microarrays, currently challenged by small amounts of available DNA. (Dagnall CL, Morton LM, Hicks BD, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29510662">Successful use of whole genome amplified DNA from multiple source types for high-density Illumina SNP microarrays.</a> BMC Genomics 2018;19:182)</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Prostate"></a>Prostate</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Serum Interleukin-16</strong></h4>
<p>To explore the role of inflammation in prostate cancer risk, the association between pre-diagnostic serum levels of interleukin-16 (IL-16), an important pleiotropic cytokine, and prostate cancer risk was evaluated in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Although no association between pre-diagnostic IL-16 and prostate cancer overall was observed among Caucasians, a significantly increased risk of high-grade prostate cancer, defined as Gleason &ge;&thinsp;7, was observed with increasing levels of IL-16. Among Caucasian men with a history of gonorrhea, elevated IL-16 levels were associated with an increased risk of prostate cancer (OR 3rd vs. 1st tertile&thinsp;=&thinsp;3.64) but no association was seen among those without a history of gonorrhea. No associations were observed among African-Americans. (Moore A, Huang WY, Danforth K, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29594819">Prospective evaluation of serum IL-16 and risk of prostate cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.</a> Cancer Causes Control 2018 May; Epub Mar 28)</p>

<h3><strong><a id="Testes"></a>Testes</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Childhood Height</strong></h4>
<p>Increased adult stature has been associated with risk of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) in a number of studies. Whether childhood stature is also associated with TGCT is unclear as no studies of measured childhood height and TGCT have been reported. Thus, associations between TGCT in adulthood and childhood height and growth between ages 7 and 13 years were examined in a cohort from the Copenhagen School Health Records Register. Analyses of this large prospective study showed that measured childhood height was positively associated with risk of TGCT. In a categorical analysis, the shortest boys were at the lowest risk of subsequently developing TGCT, whereas there was no significant association with risk among the tallest boys. Growth between ages 7 and 13 years was not associated with risk. Results were similar for seminomas and nonseminomas. These findings suggest that risk of TGCT in adulthood was already determined by age 7 years. (McGlynn KA, Petrick JL, Gamborg M, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29508384">Childhood height and risk of testicular germ cell tumors in adulthood.</a> Int J Cancer 2018; Epub Mar 6)</p>

<h3><strong><a id="UpperGITract"></a>Upper Gastrointestinal Tract</strong></h3>
<h4><strong>Vitamin Supplementation</strong></h4>
<p>A beneficial effect of supplementation with selenium, vitamin E, and beta-carotene was observed on total and cancer mortality in the Linxian Nutritional Intervention Trial, and it endured for 10 years post intervention. This report evaluated the durability of these findings after 25 years of follow-up. Through 2016, the interventions showed no effect on total mortality. The previously reported protective effect of Factor D (selenium/vitamin E/beta-carotene) against total mortality was lost 10 years post-intervention. The protective effect of Factor D for gastric cancer was attenuated, but a newly apparent protective effect against esophageal cancer was found for Factor B (riboflavin/niacin). Protective effects were found in people younger than age 55 years at baseline against non-upper gastrointestinal cancer death for Factor A (retinol/zinc) and against death from stroke for Factor C (vitamin C/molybdenum). In contrast, increased risk of esophageal cancer was found when the intervention began after age 55 years for Factors C and D. The authors concluded that multiyear nutrition intervention is unlikely to have a meaningful effect on mortality more than a decade after supplementation ends, even in a nutritionally deprived population. Whether sustained or repeat intervention would provide longer effects needs further investigation. (Wang SM, Taylor PR, Fan JH, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29617851">Effects of nutrition intervention on total and cancer mortality: 25-year post-trial follow-up of the 5.25-year Linxian Nutrition Intervention </a>Trial.

<p>In a new study, DCEG researchers and collaborators analyzed data from 13 studies in the Ovarian Cancer Cohort Consortium (OC3) in order to prospectively investigate associations of analgesic use with ovarian cancer risk. They found that women under the age of 70 who use aspirin (or non-aspirin NSAIDS) daily or almost daily for at least six months have a ~10 percent lower risk of developing ovarian cancer than women who use it infrequently or not at all.</p>
<p>Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecological cancer. Taking aspirin daily may reduce the long-term effects of chronic inflammation influential in ovarian carcinogenesis. However, effects of long-term analgesic use on ovarian carcinogenesis are still unknown. Additionally, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend frequent aspirin use in women aged 70 or older because of increased risks for adverse events in this population. In all cases, women should consult their health care providers before beginning new medication in order to balance most appropriately any potential risks with the potential benefits.</p>

<p>A new international study by scientists from the American Cancer Society, the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health, the National Cancer Institute, and more than 20 other medical centers and organizations finds that higher circulating vitamin D concentrations are significantly associated with lower colorectal cancer risk. This study strengthens the evidence, previously considered inconclusive, for a protective relationship between vitamin D concentration and colorectal cancer. The study appeared online on June 14, 2018, in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em>.</p>
<p>The investigators analyzed circulating prediagnostic concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D, the accepted measure of vitamin D status, for over 5,700 colorectal cancer cases and 7,100 controls from 17 cohorts in the United States, Europe, and Asia. A single, widely accepted assay and laboratory was used for new measurements and to calibrate existing measurements. Compared to participants with circulating vitamin D concentrations considered sufficient for bone health, those with deficient concentrations had a 31% higher risk of colorectal cancer during follow-up (an average of 5.5 years). Similarly, concentrations above bone health sufficiency were associated with a 22% lower risk. However, risk did not continue to decline at the highest concentrations. These associations persisted even after adjusting for known colorectal cancer risk factors. Though protective associations were seen in all subgroups examined; the association was noticeably stronger in women than men at concentrations above bone health sufficiency.</p>

<p>DCEG researchers increasingly take advantage of high-throughput sequencing to perform large-scale epidemiologic studies of the human microbiome. As part of these studies, statisticians are faced with performing extensive analyses and generating publishable figures, which can be time-consuming and costly. These challenge winners propose to develop an easy-to-use cloud-based webtool for statistical analyses and data visualization, enabling epidemiologists to perform a large variety of analyses directly and generate high-quality figures for publication.</p>
<h3>AuthorArranger: Create Journal Title Pages in Seconds</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1088176" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="1088176" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7258605" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="1088176">Mitchell Machiela</a>, Geoffrey Tobias (DCEG)</em></p>
<p>In the population sciences, it is common for large studies to have hundreds of contributors, often with multiple affiliations. This poses a challenge when submitting manuscripts to journals, because the title page must contain the author names, titles, and affiliations arranged in order of contribution and formatted according to the specific journal&rsquo;s style&mdash;a time- and often resource-consuming endeavor. AuthorArranger is an online tool that aims to make title page creation fast and painless. Users simply upload a file of author names and affiliations, configure formats using simple drop-down menus, preview the title page and make any necessary adjustments, and download the finished title page, ready for submission.</p>
<h3>Radiation Dose Calculation Program for Patients Undergoing Nuclear Medicine Procedures: NCINM</h3>

<p>Nuclear medicine (NM) dosimetry is a critical input for epidemiological studies of patients undergoing NM procedures. To improve dosimetry quality for use in nuclear medicine studies, the challenge winners are developing a novel radiation dose calculation program, called the National Cancer Institute dosimetry system for Nuclear Medicine (NCINM). Development will be done in two steps: first, the creation of stand-alone computer software (NCINM); second, the translation of this stand-alone version into a web-based dose calculator. The new dosimetry system will incorporate the NCI&rsquo;s library of advanced computational human phantoms, which have more realistic anatomy than those used in existing methods. While this new tool will be important for the success of current and future studies in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch, its translation to an online version will make it more attractive and easier to use by medical physicists and nuclear medicine specialists in clinical settings.</p>

Sampson</a>, (DCEG); Krista A. Zanetti (DCCPS); Sue Pan (CBIIT); Ella Temprosa (George Washington University); Ewy Math&eacute; (Ohio State University)</em></p>
<p>This project focuses on adding metabolite-naming harmonization to the Consortium of Metabolomics Studies (COMETS) online application, named <a href="https://comets-analytics.org/">COMETS-Analytics</a>, which was previously developed as a collaboration tool for analysis and sharing data among members of the consortium. Because metabolomics is a new field, and metabolite-naming conventions vary by continent, lab, and cohort, this aspect of the app has continued to be managed by hand. The latest proposed addition to the COMETS app will implement a hierarchical algorithm for harmonizing metabolite names across cohorts, enabling automatic harmonization of names.</p>

<p>In May 2018, Dr. Gary D. Wu of the University of Pennsylvania, gave the sixth Arthur Schatzkin Distinguished Lecture in Nutritional Epidemiology, entitled &ldquo;Diet, the Gut Microbiome, and its Metabolome in Health and Disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Wu&rsquo;s research focuses on the interactions between gut microbiota and the host, with particular interest in the metabolism. Currently, he is helping to direct a project investigating the impact of diet on the composition of the gut microbiome and its relationship to therapeutic responses associated with the treatment of patients with Crohn&rsquo;s disease.</p>
<p>In addition, Dr. Wu is leading a multidisciplinary group of investigators using phosphorescent nanoprobe technology to examine the dynamic oxygen equilibrium between the host and the gut microbiota at the intestinal mucosal interface.</p>
<p></p>
<p></p>
<p><em>This annual lecture honors the memory of Arthur Schatzkin, M.D., Dr.P.H., a visionary scientist, mentor, and leader in the field of nutritional epidemiology. The lecture is sponsored by the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, and Division of Cancer Prevention.</em></p>

<p>Researchers at the National Cancer Institute evaluated the coffee-drinking habits of nearly half a million people, using demographic, lifestyle, and genetic data from the UK Biobank, to determine whether genetic variation in caffeine metabolism affects associations between coffee drinking and mortality risk. The investigators confirmed previous studies showing an inverse association between coffee drinking and mortality during the study period and found similar associations in participants with genetic variants conveying both faster and slower caffeine metabolism. The findings were published on July 2, 2018, in <em>JAMA Internal Medicine</em>.</p>
<p>The rapidity of caffeine metabolism varies substantially between people. Prior data from case-control studies had suggested that coffee drinking may increase the risk of hypertension and myocardial infarction among individuals with genetic variants indicating slower caffeine metabolism. However, these prior studies assessed coffee drinking after disease occurrence and did not examine overall or cardiovascular disease mortality. In the current study, coffee drinkers were less likely to die of cardiovascular disease and cancer than non-drinkers. Similar findings were observed for participants drinking ground, instant, and decaffeinated coffee.</p>
<p>All together, these findings suggest that inverse associations between coffee and mortality may be attributable to non-caffeine constituents and may provide reassurance to coffee drinkers. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the observed associations.</p>

<p>Using data from nine historical cohort studies, investigators in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch and colleagues from other institutions, led by senior investigator <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=12&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349604" sys_contentid="349604" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349604" sys_relationshipid="7276376" sys_variantid="1965">Mark Little, D.Phil.</a>, were able to quantify&mdash;for the first time&mdash;excess risk for leukemia and other myeloid malignancies following low-dose exposure to ionizing radiation in childhood. More than two-fold increased risk and higher was observed for cumulative exposures less than 100 milliSieverts (mSv); excess risk was also apparent for cumulative doses of less than 20 mSv for some endpoints. The findings were published online July 16, 2018 in <em>Lancet Haematology</em>.</p>
<p>Because these diseases are rare, the excess absolute risk in the population is estimated to be small. Nevertheless, given the ubiquity of exposure, primarily from medical procedures like computed tomography (CT) scans, every effort should be made to minimize doses, especially for children.</p>
<p>Although substantial evidence links exposure to moderate or high doses of ionizing radiation, particularly in childhood, to increased risk of leukemia, prior to this study the association of leukemia with exposure to low-dose radiation was not well-established. Evaluating risks at low-doses, under 100 mSv, is crucial since this is the range most relevant to the general population. Additionally, some have suggested that this level, about 100 mSv, may represent a threshold dose of radiation below which there is no excess risk of leukemia. Evidence from this study suggests, on the contrary, that there is significant risk even at these lower doses, and that the current system of radiological protection is prudent and not overly protective.</p>
<p>Data for this analysis came from more than 250,000 individuals aged 21 or younger at the time of first exposure and were contributed from nine cohort studies (from Canada, France, Japan, Sweden, the UK, and the US) enrolled between June 4, 1915, and December 31, 2004.</p>

<p>A new analysis by DCEG investigators and collaborators at the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, projects future premature death rates and the number of excess deaths for the U.S. population aged 25 to 64 by race or ethnicity and sex. Their findings were published online July 20, 2018, in the journal <em>Lancet Public Health</em>.</p>
<p>The authors used age-period-cohort models to project the impact of the continuing divergence of trends in premature death rates by race or ethnicity and sex. Projected increases in premature deaths among non-Hispanic white women and American Indians or Alaska Natives are estimated to cause an additional 240,000 deaths between 2017 and 2030, compared to the number expected if death rates remained stable over that period&mdash;an increase of 10 percent. The majority of those deaths&mdash;over 100,000&mdash;are expected to be accidental, a category that includes drug overdoses. <br /><br />In contrast, continued declines are projected for non-Hispanic white men, and black, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander men and women, resulting in nearly 1,000,000 fewer premature deaths during the same period&mdash;a reduction of 14 percent, driven mostly by the estimated 300,000 fewer deaths from cancer.</p>
<p>The authors based their analysis on death certificate data from the National Center for Health Statistics.</p>

<p>An international consortium of researchers reports three new common, inherited loci, and validation of three previously reported susceptibility regions that confer risk for Ewing sarcoma (EWS), a rare pediatric bone tumor for which genetic risk factors were poorly understood. The findings were published Thursday, August 8, 2018, in the journal <em>Nature Communications</em>.</p>
<p>DCEG investigators and collaborators, combined cases from the previously published EWS GWAS with four new sample sets for a total of 733 cases and 1,346 unaffected individuals. Their analyses revealed surprising risk effects from the six susceptibility loci, given the relatively small number of cases&mdash;odds ratios of 1.7, unusually high for results from a GWAS, and interactions between inherited variation and the acquired <em>EWSR1-FLI1</em> translocation carried by the majority of EWS cases. Because the absolute risk for EWS is low, population-based screening with these six variants is unlikely to be effective. The researchers plan to follow up on the biologically plausible candidate genes identified through their study with the ultimate goal to expand our understanding of EWS etiology and provide insight into improved treatment and potentially preventative measures to reduce the overall burden of EWS.</p>

<p>The DCEG Summer Intern Program celebrated its 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary with the high-caliber work of this year&rsquo;s interns on display at a poster session on August 7, 2018.</p>
<p>Over 50 investigators and Office of Education staff mentored 3 high school students, 21 undergraduates, 12 Masters-level, and 5 doctoral students, hailing from 14 states around the country. These students were selected from a pool of over 400 applicants; each were given the opportunity to conduct research with their mentor and share their findings with peers and DCEG colleagues at the poster session. It was a lively event where their hard work and dedication were on excellent display.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>This summer,&nbsp;staff and fellows from DCEG and DCCPS&nbsp;taught students enrolled in the NIH High School Scientific Training and Enrichment Program (Hi-STEP) about vaccines and coached them through the making of a public health campaign video on a vaccine of their choice. The 25 students graduated from the program on August 9, 2018, with invaluable experiences, established relationships with mentors at the NIH, and deepened interest in biomedical careers as well as in Science, Technology, Engineering, Math and Medicine (STEM-M).</p>
<p>DCEG and DCCPS staff and fellows included: Maura Kate Costello, <a href="https://surveillance.cancer.gov/about/bios/ehrenkranzr.html">Rebecca Ehrenkranz</a>, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349643" sys_contentid="349643" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349643" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7104012" sys_folderid="">Jackie Lavigne</a>, Ka Lai Lou, <a href="https://surveillance.cancer.gov/about/bios/mintzr.html">Rebecca Ilene Mintz</a>, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/cgb-fellows#Wang">Youjin Wang</a>, and&nbsp;Diane Wigfield.</p>
<p>Every year, the NIH&nbsp;Office of Intramural Training &amp; Education&nbsp;selects a diverse group of talented high school students from the&nbsp;District of Columbia&nbsp;metro area to participate in Hi-STEP. The goal of the program is to diversify and expand the pipeline for training in biomedicine and healthcare by providing opportunities for individuals from schools with a large population of financially-disadvantaged students.</p>
<p>Hi-STEP participants take part in a seven-week, full-time summer internship located on the main NIH campus in Bethesda, Maryland. Students explore the breadth of the scientific enterprise, the importance of biomedical research, and many STEM-M careers. They participate in workshops, lectures, and hands-on activities designed to prepare them for college and career readiness. <a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/histep">Read more about Hi-STEP</a>.</p>

<p>In the largest analysis to date looking at the extent to which vaginal bleeding is associated with endometrial cancer in women who have gone through menopause, 90% of women diagnosed with endometrial cancer reported bleeding before their cancer diagnosis. Approximately 9% of postmenopausal women who saw a doctor for bleeding later received a diagnosis of endometrial cancer. The study was led by DCEG investigators, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/cgb-fellows#Clarke">Megan Clarke, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=34&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349668" sys_contentid="349668" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349668" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7277833">Nicolas Wentzensen, M.D.,&nbsp;Ph.D.</a></p>
<p>Unlike many other cancer types, the rate of endometrial cancer has increased in recent years and is expected to continue rising worldwide over the coming decade. This rise is thought to be largely due to factors that affect hormones, such as rising obesity rates and changes in how many children women are likely to have.</p>
<p>If endometrial cancer is found early, a woman has a 95% chance of surviving the cancer for at least 5 years. By contrast, for women diagnosed after their cancer has spread outside the uterus, the chance of surviving for at least 5 years is much lower, ranging from 16&ndash;45%.</p>

<p>In October 2018, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/brown-kevin">Kevin Brown, Ph.D.</a>, was awarded scientific tenure by the NIH and promoted to senior investigator in the Laboratory of Translational Genomics. Dr. Brown&rsquo;s research is focused on identifying cancer genetic susceptibility loci and the functional pathways through which they affect risk, primarily for melanoma.</p>
<p>Dr. Brown has pioneered successful approaches to the identification and characterization of rare high-penetrance mutations in melanoma-prone families, including his seminal discovery of <em>MITF</em> as a susceptibility gene. He also explores the genetic basis of common germline variants conferring risk of melanoma and kidney cancer and is actively involved in ongoing melanoma genome-wide association study (GWAS) efforts within DCEG and through the International Melanoma Genetics Consortium (GenoMEL). Overall, he has contributed to the identification of most of the 20 known melanoma GWAS risk loci.</p>
<p>Beyond identification of germline risk loci through GWAS, Dr. Brown&rsquo;s lab investigates the function of the associated variants. Of particular note is his work characterizing the <em>PARP1</em> melanoma locus. Not only did he identify the functional risk variant at 1q42.1 locus and define mechanistically how it acts to influence gene expression, but through a series of experiments in primary cultures he was able to functionally link <em>PARP1</em> to cell growth, transformation, escape from oncogene-induced senescence, and unexpectedly, transcriptional regulation of a key melanoma oncogene.</p>

<p>All-cause mortality rates in the U.S. have decreased for most ages and racial/ethnic groups but remain higher and are improving more slowly compared to Canada and the United Kingdom. However, cause-specific mortality increased for infants by accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed, and for young adults by suicide and drug poisoning. The findings were published online October 1, 2018, in the journal <em>JAMA Pediatrics</em>.</p>
<p>DCEG investigators and collaborators examined death certificate data from the U.S. National Center of Health Statistics, Statistics Canada, and the U.K. Office of National Statistics, focusing particularly on all deaths that occurred between 1999 and 2015 among children and young-adults aged 25 or younger in the United States, Canada, and England/Wales. In addition to stratifying the data by 4-year age brackets, the U.S. data was further stratified by race/ethnicity.</p>
<p>In 2015,&nbsp;declines in mortality rates&nbsp;resulted in approximately 12,000 fewer deaths compared to what was expected based on 1999-2002 rates. Increases in infant mortality rates due to accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed resulted in 560 additional deaths; increases in suicide and drug poisoning rates in&nbsp;youth, resulted in an additional&nbsp;1,700 and 2,100 deaths, respectively. The authors noted striking racial disparities in the U.S. Even though the infant mortality rate declined by 20% between 1999 and 2015, achieving the Healthy People 2020 goal of &lt;6 deaths/1,000 infants, infant mortality rates in 2015 remained exceptionally high for blacks (11 deaths/1,000 infants) and American Indians and Alaska Natives (9.7 deaths/1,000 infants).</p>
<p>The authors note: the findings of this study support the urgent need for policies and interventions that aim to prevent drug poisoning and suicide, such as improved diagnosis and treatment of depression in youth. Additionally, efforts to improve maternal health and access to quality healthcare and to educate parents about healthy sleeping habits for infants should remain a priority.</p>

<h4>Fish and Omega-3 Fatty Acids</h4>
<p>Data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study showed that higher fish and long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCn-3 PUFAs) were significantly associated with lower total mortality. Comparing the highest with lowest quintiles of fish intake, men had 9% lower total mortality, 10% lower cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, 6% lower cancer mortality, 20% lower respiratory disease mortality, and 37% lower chronic liver disease mortality, while women had 8% lower total mortality, 10% lower CVD mortality, and 38% lower Alzheimer's disease mortality. Fried fish consumption was not related to mortality among men whereas among women it was positively associated with mortality from all causes, CVD, and respiratory disease. (Zhang Y, Zhuang P, He W, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30019399">Association of fish and long-chain omega-3 fatty acids intakes with total and cause-specific mortality: Prospective analysis of 421,309 individuals</a>. <em>J Intern Med</em> 2018; Epub Jul 17).</p>
<h4>Infant and Youth Mortality Trends</h4>
<p>Investigators examined death certificate data from the U.S. National Center of Health Statistics, Statistics Canada, and the U.K. Office of National Statistics, focusing on deaths that occurred between 1999 and 2015 among children and young-adults aged 25 or younger in the United States, Canada, and England/Wales. In 2015, declines in mortality rates resulted in approximately 12,000 fewer deaths compared to what was expected based on 1999-2002 rates. Increases in infant mortality rates due to accidental suffocation and strangulation in bed resulted in 560 additional deaths; increases in suicide and drug poisoning rates in youth, resulted in an additional 1,700 and 2,100 deaths, respectively. The authors noted striking racial disparities in the U.S. Even though the infant mortality rate declined by 20% between 1999 and 2015, infant mortality rates in 2015 remained exceptionally high for blacks (11 deaths/1,000 infants) and American Indians and Alaska Natives (9.7 deaths/1,000 infants). (Khan SQ, Berrington de Gonzalez A, Best AF, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30285034">Infant and youth mortality trends by race/ethnicity and cause of death in the United States</a>. <em>JAMA Pediatr</em> 2018; Epub Oct 1).&nbsp; For more information, read <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1424&amp;sys_contentid=1125569" sys_contentid="1125569" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7277662" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1125569" sys_dependentvariantid="1424" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1424">Pediatric Mortality Decreases in U.S., but Rates Still Higher than Canada and U.K.</a> in Research News &amp; Highlights.</p>
<h4>Mosaic Chromosome Y Loss</h4>
<p>The authors characterized mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) in relation to age, smoking, and other exposures in a large cohort of 223,338 men from the U.K. Biobank. A total of 3,789 (1.7%) men showed evidence for mLOY, with less occurring among men of African ancestry than men of European ancestry. mLOY increases occurred exponentially with age and were strongly associated with current smoking and mortality from diabetes and cardiovascular disease. mLOY was also associated with all-cause mortality among men with a high proportion of cells affected (hazard ration (HR)=1.35). Further functional studies are warranted to understand how and in what way mLOY could influence adult male health. (Loftfield E, Zhou W, Graubard BI, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30120341">Predictors of mosaic chromosome Y loss and associations with mortality in the U.K. Biobank</a>. <em>Sci Rep</em> 2018; 8:12316).</p>
<h4>Neighborhood Socioeconomic Deprivation</h4>
<p>Low neighborhood socioeconomic status has been linked to adverse health outcomes. However, it is unclear whether changes to&nbsp;the neighborhood may influence health. Data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study showed that improvement in neighborhood socioeconomic status was associated with lower mortality rate, while deterioration was associated with higher mortality rate. More specifically, a 30-percentile point reduction in neighborhood deprivation among more deprived neighborhoods was associated with 11% and 19% reduction in total mortality rate among men and women respectively. On the other hand, a 30-point increase in neighborhood deprivation in less deprived neighborhoods was associated with a 11% increase in mortality rate in men. (Xiao Q, Berrigan D, Powell-Wiley TM, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30137194">Changes in neighborhood socioeconomic deprivation and mortality in U.S. adults</a>. <em>Am J Epidemiol</em> 2018; Epub Aug 22).</p>
<h4>Premature Mortality Projections</h4>
<p>Using age-period-cohort models and death certificate data from the National Center for Health Statistics, investigators projected future premature death rates and the number of excess deaths for the U.S. population aged 25 to 64 by race or ethnicity and sex. Projected increases in premature deaths among non-Hispanic white women and American Indians or Alaska Natives are estimated to result in an additional 240,000 deaths between 2017 and 2030, compared to the number expected if death rates remained stable over that period&mdash;an increase of 10 percent. The majority of those deaths&mdash;over 100,000&mdash;are expected to be accidental, a category that includes drug overdoses. In contrast, continued declines are projected for non-Hispanic white men, and black, Hispanic, and Asian or Pacific Islander men and women, resulting in nearly 1,000,000 fewer premature deaths during the same period&mdash;a reduction of 14 percent, driven mostly by the estimated 300,000 fewer deaths from cancer. (Best AF, Haozous EA, de Gonzalez AB, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30037721">Premature mortality projections in the USA through 2030: A modelling study</a>. <em>Lancet Public Health</em> 2018;3:e374-e384).

<h4>Reductions in Cigarettes per Day</h4>
<p>Many smokers do not quit but instead reduce the number of cigarettes that they smoke per day (CPD) over their lifetime. The associations of such changes in CPD with health risks are unclear.&nbsp;Data from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study showed that, relative to never smokers, smokers who maintained a consistent CPD had 2.93 times higher all-cause mortality risk, with still higher risks observed in participants who increased their CPD (HR: 3.37). Risks were lower among participants who decreased their CPD (HR: 2.38) or quit smoking (HR: 1.32). Similar patterns were observed for smoking-related causes of death, with particularly strong associations for lung cancer and respiratory disease. (Inoue-Choi M, Hartge P, Park Y, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30299454">Reductions in cigarettes per day and mortality among older adults in the United States</a>. <em>Am J Epidemiol</em> 2018; Epub Oct 9).</p>
<h4>Smoking Daily vs Non-Daily&nbsp;</h4>
<p>Using data from the U.S. National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS), investigators reported that that lifelong non-daily cigarette smokers who had never smoked daily were 1.7 times more likely to die from any cause during the follow-up period than never smokers. Additionally, relative to never smokers, lifelong non-daily smokers lived five years less and daily smokers lived ten years less. (Inoue-Choi M, McNeel TS, Hartge P, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30454906">Non-Daily Cigarette Smokers: Mortality Risks in the U.S.</a> <em>Am J Prev Med</em> 2018 Oct 24; Epub ahead of print).</p>

<h4>Vitamin C</h4>
<p>To evaluate the relationship between vitamin C intake and mortality, investigators randomly selected 948 subjects (473 males and 475 females) aged 53-84 years from a Chinese cohort and measured meta-phosphoric acid-preserved vitamin C concentrations in plasma samples collected in 1999-2000. There were a total of 551 deaths through 2016, including 141 from cancer, 170 from stroke and 174 from heart diseases. In this long-term prospective Chinese cohort study, higher plasma vitamin C concentration was associated with lower total mortality, heart disease mortality and cancer mortality. (Wang SM, Fan JH, Taylor PR, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30100578">Association of plasma vitamin C concentration to total and cause-specific mortality: A 16-year prospective study in China</a>. <em>J Epidemiol Community Health</em> 2018; Epub Aug 12).</p>
<h4>Vitamin D and Survival</h4>
<p>Investigators examined the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], and cancer survival in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study. Serum 25(OH)D was significantly lower among cases who subsequently died from their malignancy compared with those who did not. Higher 25(OH)D was associated with lower overall cancer mortality (hazard ratio (HR)&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.76 for highest vs. lowest quintile). Higher 25(OH)D was related to lower mortality from prostate (HR&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.74) and kidney (HR&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.59) cancers, as well as melanoma (HR&thinsp;=&thinsp;0.39), but increased mortality from lung cancer (HR&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.28). Improved survival was also suggested for head and neck, gastric, pancreatic, and liver cancers, though not significantly. (Weinstein SJ, Mondul AM, Yu K, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30073448">Circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D up to 3 decades prior to diagnosis in relation to overall and organ-specific cancer survival</a>. <em>Eur J Epidemiol</em> 2018; Epub Aug 2).</p>

<h3><a id="Bladder"></a>Bladder</h3>
<h4>Arsenic</h4>
<p>Populations exposed to arsenic in drinking water have an increased bladder cancer risk and evidence suggests that several factors may modify arsenic metabolism, influencing disease risk. Data from a population-based case-control study of 1,213 bladder cancer cases and 1,418 controls provided some limited evidence of modifying roles of age, sex, smoking, body mass index (BMI), folate, and alcohol on arsenic-related bladder cancer risk. Among former smokers and current smokers, those with the highest cumulative arsenic intake had elevated risks of bladder cancer (odds ratio (OR)=1.4 and OR=1.6, respectively; while the OR among never smokers was 1.1, p-interaction=0.49). Among those classified as normal or overweight, based on usual adult BMI, the highest level of cumulative arsenic intake was associated with elevated risks of bladder cancer (OR=1.3 and OR=1.6, respectively), while risk was not elevated among those who were obese (OR=0.9, p-interaction=0.14). (Koutros S, Baris D, Waddell R, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29981168">Potential effect modifiers of the arsenic-bladder cancer risk relationship</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2018; Epub Jul 7).</p>

<h4>Serum Cytokines</h4>
<p>Because of growing evidence that history of allergic or autoimmune disease is associated with reduced risk of glioma, investigators assessed associations of immune conditions with levels of 14 cytokines in serial prediagnostic serum samples in a nested case-control study of glioma/brain among military personnel. A total of 457 case-control sets were ascertained from the Department of Defense (DoD) Automated Central Tumor Registry, Defense Medical Surveillance System (DMSS) database, and DoD Serum Repository. The overall association between glioma and prior immune-related conditions was null, however higher levels of IL-15 and IL-16 were independently significantly associated with lower glioma risks, particularly among individuals with prior immune conditions. (Brenner AV, Inskip PD, Rusiecki J, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30297770">Serially measured pre-diagnostic levels of serum cytokines and risk of brain cancer in active component military personnel</a>. <em>Br J Cancer</em> 2018 Oct).</p>

<h3><a id="Breast"></a>Breast</h3>
<h4>Black-White Incidence Trends</h4>
<p>Recent reports of converging black and white breast cancer incidence rates have gained much attention, however the incidence rates have been based on the sum of non-Hispanics and Hispanics, which may mask important ethnicity-specific trends. Race- and ethnicity-specific breast cancer rates from the NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) 13 Registries Database from 1992-2014 were used in age-period-cohort models to project rates for 2015-2030. Results confirmed merging of age-standardized incidence rates for blacks and whites circa 2012, but not for non-Hispanic black (NHB) and non-Hispanic white (NHW) women. Incidence rates were highest for NHW women, followed by NHB women, and then Hispanic white women. The sample size for Hispanic blacks was too small for analysis. (Davis Lynn BC, Rosenberg PS, Anderson WF, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29982593">Black-white breast cancer incidence trends: Effects of ethnicity</a>. <em>J Natl Cancer Inst</em> 2018; Epub Jul 5).</p>
<h4>Estrogen Metabolism</h4>
<p>The Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative (WHI) Clinical Trial found an unexpected reduced breast cancer risk in women using conjugated equine estrogens (CEE) alone. Investigators hypothesized CEE alone induces estrogen hydroxylation along the 2-pathway rather than the competing 16-pathway, a pattern linked to reduced postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Data from a nested case-control study of estrogen metabolites in relation to ovarian and endometrial cancer risk in the WHI Observational Study, suggest that estrogen metabolism may differ for estrogen alone compared to estrogen plus progestin users, with estrogen alone inducing estrogen metabolism away from the 16‐pathway and toward the 2‐pathway, a pattern shown to reduce breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. Whether this pattern of estrogen metabolism persists after cessation of hormone therapy is not known. (Falk RT, Manson JE, Barnabei VM, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30183089">Estrogen metabolism in menopausal hormone users in the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study: Does it differ between estrogen plus progestin and estrogen alone?</a> <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2018; Epub Sep 5).</p>
<h4>Pregnancy Complications</h4>
<p>A large registry‐linked pooled study based on data from four Nordic countries showed that women with a history of hypertension, both prior to and newly occurring in pregnancy, and preeclampsia were associated with an &sim;10% reduction in subsequent maternal breast cancer risk. The associations did not appear to be explained by factors that predispose to the development of either of these conditions and breast cancer, and generally did not vary by several other pregnancy factors associated with breast cancer risk. The mechanisms mediating these modest risk reductions are unknown and warrant further laboratory, clinical and epidemiological investigation. (Troisi R, Gulbech Ording A, Grotmol T, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29752724">Pregnancy complications and subsequent breast cancer risk in the mother: A Nordic population-based case-control study</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2018; Epub August 10).</p>
<h4>Tumor Molecular Subtypes</h4>
<p>Etiologic differences in risk factors for various subtypes of breast cancer defined by estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) were examined in two recent studies:</p>
<p>Risks among women primarily of European descent were investigated using pooled data from nine cohort studies. Ever parous compared to never was associated with lower risk of luminal A-like (hazard ratio (HR)=0.78)) and luminal B-like (HR=0.74), as well as a higher risk of triple negative disease (HR=1.23). Direct associations with luminal-like, but not HER2-enriched or triple negative, tumors were found for age at first birth, years between menarche and first birth, and age at menopause. Age-specific associations with baseline body mass index differed for risk of luminal A-like and triple-negative breast cancer. (Gaudet MM, Gierach GL, Carter BD, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30185547">Pooled analysis of nine cohorts reveals breast cancer risk factors by tumor molecular subtype</a>. <em>Cancer Res</em> 2018; Epub Sep 5).</p>
<p>A study of women with invasive breast cancer in Sarawak, Malaysia, demonstrated heterogeneity in the relationships between parity/breastfeeding, age at first full-term pregnancy (FFP), family history, body mass index (BMI), and tumor subtype. Among luminal A-like patients only, older age at menarche and being underweight or overweight were associated with adverse prognosis, while parity/breastfeeding and older age at FFP were associated with good prognosis. (Abubakar M, Sung H, Bcr D, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30227867">Breast cancer risk factors, survival and recurrence, and tumor molecular subtype: Analysis of 3012 women from an indigenous Asian population</a>. <em>Breast Cancer Res</em> 2018).</p>

<h3><a id="Esophagus"></a>Esophagus</h3>
<h4>Circulating Markers of Inflammation</h4>
<p>A nested case-control study of 296 esophageal adenocarcinoma cases and 296 controls from seven prospective cohort studies was conducted to evaluate 69 circulating inflammation markers in relation to cancer risk, as well as the direct and indirect role of obesity and smoking. Soluble tumor necrosis factor receptor 2 (sTNFR2) was significantly associated with esophageal adenocarcinoma. Additional markers close to the adjusted significance threshold included C reactive protein, serum amyloid A, lipocalin-2, resistin, interleukin (IL) 3, IL17A, soluble IL-6 receptor and soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 3. Adjustment for body mass index, waist circumference or smoking status slightly attenuated biomarker-cancer associations. Mediation analysis indicated that sTNFR2 may account for 33% of the effect of waist circumference on esophageal adenocarcinoma risk. For smoking status, only plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 was a nominally statistically significant mediator of cancer risk. This prospective study provides evidence of a link between systemic inflammation and esophageal adenocarcinoma risk. In addition, this study provides the first evidence that indirect effects of excess adiposity and cigarette smoking, via systemic inflammation, increase the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma. (Cook MB, Barnett MJ, Bock CH, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30121626">Prediagnostic circulating markers of inflammation and risk of oesophageal adenocarcinoma: A study within the National Cancer Institute Cohort Consortium</a>. <em>Gut</em> 2018; Epub Aug 18).</p>

<h3><a id="Ewing-Sarcoma"></a>Ewing Sarcoma</h3>
<h4>Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a pediatric cancer characterized by the <em>EWSR1-FLI1</em> fusion. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 733 EWS cases and 1346 unaffected individuals of European ancestry replicated previously reported susceptibility loci at 1p36.22, 10q21.3 and 15q15.1, and identified new loci at 6p25.1, 20p11.22 and 20p11.23. Effect estimates exhibit odds ratios in excess of 1.7, which is high for cancer GWAS, and striking in light of the rarity of EWS cases in familial cancer syndromes. Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses identify candidate genes at 6p25.1 (<em>RREB1</em>) and 20p11.23 (<em>KIZ</em>). The 20p11.22 locus is near <em>NKX2-2</em>, a highly overexpressed gene in EWS. Interestingly, most loci reside near GGAA repeat sequences and may disrupt binding of the EWSR1-FLI1 fusion protein. The high locus to case discovery ratio from 733 EWS cases suggests a genetic architecture in which moderate risk single nucleotide polymorphisms constitute a significant fraction of risk. (Machiela MJ, Gr&uuml;newald TGP, Surdez D, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30093639">Genome-wide association study identifies multiple new loci associated with Ewing sarcoma susceptibility</a>. <em>Nat Commun</em> 2018;9:3184).

<h4>Obesity</h4>
<p>A nested case-control study of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) within the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health care network showed that obesity (BMI&thinsp;&ge;&thinsp;30&thinsp;kg/m<sup>2</sup>) was associated with clear cell RCC (odds ratio (OR)=1.5)) and chromophobe RCC (OR=2.5), but not with papillary RCC (OR=1.0). In a meta-analysis including three additional studies, a similar pattern of summary relative risks (SRR) for obesity was observed across subtypes (clear cell: SRR=1.8; chromophobe: SRR=2.2; papillary, SRR=1.2). These findings support the hypothesis that histologic subtypes of RCC possess distinct etiologic pathways, with obesity important for the development of clear cell and, possibly, chromophobe RCC, but not papillary RCC. (Callahan CL, Hofmann JN, Corley DA, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30029068">Obesity and renal cell carcinoma risk by histologic subtype: A nested case-control study and meta-analysis</a>. <em>Cancer Epidemiol</em> 2018; Epub July 18).</p>
<h4>Vitamin D Binding Protein</h4>
<p>Investigators conducted a nested case-control study in the American Cancer Society Cancer Prevention Study-II (CPS-II) Nutrition Cohort to prospectively examine circulating vitamin D binding protein (DBP) concentration and renal cell carcinoma risk. There was a statistically significant inverse trend across quartiles of DBP such that participants with higher DBP had a markedly decreased risk of renal cell carcinoma (vs. Q1: Q2 odds ratio (OR)=0.93; Q3 OR=0.42; Q4 OR=0.33, <em>p</em> for trend=0.03). The strong inverse association between circulating DBP and risk of renal cell carcinoma supports the findings from one previous report.

<h4>Risk from Low-Dose Radiation Exposure</h4>
<p>Substantial evidence links exposure to moderate or high doses of ionizing radiation, particularly in childhood, with increased risk of leukemia. The role of low-dose (&lt; 100 mSv) radiation is less certain, although this is the dose range most relevant to the general population. Data from nine historical cohorts from Canada, France, Japan, Sweden, the UK, and the USA were used to evaluate leukemia risk among 262,573 people who had been exposed to less than 100 mSv enrolled between 1915 and 2004. Mean follow-up was 19&middot;63 years (SD 17&middot;75) and mean cumulative ABM dose was 19&middot;6 mSv (SD 22&middot;7). The risks of acute myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia were significantly increased after cumulative doses of ionizing radiation of less than 100 mSv, with an excess risk also apparent for cumulative radiation doses of less than 50 mSv for some endpoints. These findings support an increased risk of leukemia associated with low-dose exposure to radiation and imply that the current system of radiological protection is prudent and not overly protective.

<h4>Autoimmune Conditions</h4>
<p>Using the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, investigators evaluated associations between autoimmune conditions and hepatobiliary cancers by anatomic site in a large, U.S. population‐based case&ndash;control study of Medicare‐aged adults. In combined as well as in separate analyses for inpatient versus outpatient-only diagnoses, there was a 1.1‐ to 31.3‐fold increased risk of hepatobiliary cancer after diagnosis of a range of different autoimmune diseases. Several autoimmune conditions with gastrointestinal tract involvement (Crohn's diseases, primary biliary cholangitis, primary sclerosing cholangitis and ulcerative colitis) were associated with increased risk at multiple hepatobiliary cancer sites, with the strongest risk estimate (odds ratio (OR)=31.33) observed for primary biliary cholangitis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Associations for hepatobiliary‐related autoimmune conditions were especially strong, with ORs ranging from 4.53 to 7.18 in the combined inpatient and outpatient analysis. In addition, generalized systemic conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis and systemic lupus erythematosus, were associated with increased risk at some hepatobiliary cancer sites. These data support a shared immuno-inflammatory etiology to these cancers. (McGee EE, Castro FA, Engels EA, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30155920">Associations between autoimmune conditions and hepatobiliary cancer risk among elderly U.S. adults</a>. <em>Int J Cancer</em> 2018; Epub Aug 28).</p>
<h4>Body Mass Index and Diabetes</h4>
<p>The association between obesity and diabetes and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) risk was evaluated in data from the Liver Cancer Pooling Project (LCPP), a consortium of 13 U.S.-based, prospective cohort studies, as well as through a systematic review/meta-analysis of the literature. In the LCPP, obesity and diabetes were associated with a 62% and an 81% increased ICC risk, respectively. In the meta-analysis, obesity and diabetes were associated with a 49% and 53% increased ICC risk, respectively. (Petrick JL, Thistle JE, Zeleniuch-Jacquotte A, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30177781">Body mass index, diabetes and intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma risk: The Liver Cancer Pooling Project and meta-analysis</a>. <em>Am J Gastroenterol</em> 2018; Epub Sep 5).</p>
<h4>Tooth Loss</h4>
<p>Tooth loss has been reported to be associated with the risk of liver cancer in studies in economically advantaged countries. Data from the Nutrition Intervention Trials, two randomized placebo-controlled trials of vitamin/mineral supplementation in Linxian, China, were used to evaluate whether this relationship is also evident in economically disadvantaged populations. Overall, persons in the highest quartile of age-specific tooth loss had an increased risk of liver cancer (hazard ratio (HR)=1.27)), which was not statistically significant. Results varied by sex and body mass index (BMI), however. Women in the highest quartile of age-specific tooth loss had a significantly increased risk (HR=1.64), while men did not (HR=1.08), and persons with a BMI &gt; 23.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (HR=1.71) had a significantly increased risk, while persons with a BMI &lt;23.0 kg/m<sup>2</sup> (HR=1.14) did not.

<h4>Air Pollution</h4>
<p>The association between exposure to outdoor particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter &le;10 &mu;m (PM10) and lung cancer risk was analyzed quantitatively using The Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) case-control study conducted in highly polluted areas in Italy. Lung cancer risk increased with increasing PM10 category (P-value for trend: 0.04). The association appeared stronger for squamous cell carcinoma. This study illustrates the need to strengthen policies to reduce airborne pollution.

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility Pathways</h4>
<p>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified the chromosome 15q25.1 locus as a leading susceptibility region for lung cancer. Investigators explored the pathogenic pathways, through which susceptibility single nucleotide polymorphisms&nbsp;within chromosome 15q25.1 affect lung cancer risk, using data from three cohorts with GWAS data from 42,901 individuals and lung expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) data from 409 individuals. The KEGG neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway, two Reactome pathways, and 22 Gene Ontology terms were identified and replicated to be significantly associated with lung cancer risk. Functional annotation of eQTL analysis results showed that the neuroactive ligand receptor interaction pathway and gated channel activity were involved in lung cancer risk. (Ji X, Boss&eacute; Y, Landi MT, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30104567">Identification of susceptibility pathways for the role of chromosome 15q25.1 in modifying lung cancer risk</a>. <em>Nat Commun</em> 2018;9:3221).</p>

<h4>Genetic Susceptibility</h4>
<p>A two-stage genome-wide association study of Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia (WM)/lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) identified two high-risk loci at 6p25.3 (rs116446171, near <em>EXOC2</em> and <em>IRF4</em>; odds ratio (OR)=21.14)) and 14q32.13 (rs117410836, near <em>TCL1</em>; OR=4.90). <em>In silico</em> data suggest that rs116446171 may have functional importance, and in functional studies, investigators demonstrated increased reporter transcription and proliferation in cells transduced with the 6p25.3 risk allele. These loci explain 4% of the familial risk and provide insights into genetic susceptibility to this malignancy.

<h4>Oral Sample Collection Methods</h4>
<p>A number of cohort studies have collected Scope<sup>&reg;</sup> mouthwash samples by mail, which are being used for microbiota measurements. Investigators&nbsp;studied the stability of Scope mouthwash samples at ambient temperature and determined the comparability of Scope mouthwash with saliva collection using the OMNIgene&bull;ORAL by comparing aliquots of oral samples collected with the OMNIgene&bull;ORAL and Scope mouthwash that were frozen immediately with aliquots that remained at ambient temperature for four days and then frozen. The overall stability of the Scope mouthwash samples was relatively high for alpha and beta diversity. Similarly, the intraclass correlations for the relative abundance of the top 25 genera were generally high. Overall, the Scope mouthwash samples appear to be stable at ambient temperature, which suggests that oral rinse samples received by the mail can be used for microbial analyses. However, Scope mouthwash samples were distinct compared to OMNIgene&bull;ORAL samples. Studies should try to compare oral microbial metrics within one sample collection type.

<h3><a id="Multiple-Myeloma"></a>Multiple Myeloma</h3>
<h4>Alcohol Consumption</h4>
<p>The risk of multiple myeloma (MM) in relation to alcohol consumption was investigated among 499,292 participants enrolled in the prospective NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. A total of 1,312 MM cases were identified during follow-up through 2011. Overall, increasing frequency of alcohol consumption was inversely associated with MM (<em>p</em> for trend=0.01), with a significant association among those who consumed two drinks per day); similar but not significant associations were observed for greater frequency of alcohol consumption. Among women, risk of MM was reduced among those who consumed less than one drink per day (HR=0.73), and associations with greater frequency of alcohol consumption were inverse although not statistically significant. The findings of this large prospective investigation suggest that moderate alcohol consumption may be associated with reduced&nbsp;risk of MM.

<h3><a id="Nasopharynx"></a>Nasopharynx</h3>
<h4>Epstein-Barr Virus</h4>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is an obligatory factor in the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC), and anti-EBV IgA antibodies are elevated many years prior to the development of NPC. Nearly all adults are infected with EBV, but only a few develop cancer, suggesting that additional co-factors, including genetic susceptibility, must be required for the disease to manifest. Investigators compared anti-EBV IgA antibody seropositivity between family members in the Taiwan Family Study predicted to be carriers of NPC-linked genetic variants and those with a lower likelihood of carrying such variants. Obligate carriers of NPC susceptibility variants were nine-fold more likely to be anti-EBV IgA positive compared to family members predicted not to carry disease-causing variants. Genetic susceptibility associated with control over this common herpes virus is likely a co-factor in determining which EBV-infected adults develop NPC.

<h3><a id="Occupational-Exposure"></a>Occupational Exposure</h3>
<h4>Gene Expression Predictors</h4>
<p>Previously, investigators used microarrays and mRNA-Sequencing (mRNA-Seq) to demonstrate that occupational exposure to a range of benzene levels perturbed gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In the current study, the investigators used the nCounter platform and SuperLearner to validate the altered expression of multiple mRNAs by benzene and identified gene pairs predictive of exposure to benzene at levels below the U.S. occupational standard of 1ppm. The predictive gene pairs are <em>PRG2/CLEC5A</em>, <em>NFKBI/CLEC5A</em>, and <em>ACSL1/CLEC5A</em>. They play roles in innate immunity and inflammatory responses.

<h3><a id="Ovary"></a>Ovary</h3>
<h4>Childhood Body Size</h4>
<p>Using data from the Copenhagen School Health Records Register, investigators evaluated if childhood body mass index, height, and growth patterns were associated with ovarian cancer overall and by histologic subtypes. Compared with non-overweight girls, at most ages, overweight girls&nbsp;had increased risks of ovarian cancer overall, mucinous, endometrioid and clear cell ovarian cancers, but not serous and other ovarian cancers. Childhood height had positive and significant associations with ovarian cancer overall and the endometrioid subtype but not with the other sub-types. Adjusting for birth weight minimally altered the associations with childhood body size. In growth analyses, overweight girls or those who were taller than average at ages 7 and 13 had increased risks of ovarian cancer overall compared with average-sized girls at both ages. (Aarestrup J, Trabert B, Ulrich LG, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262600">Childhood overweight, tallness and growth increase risks of ovarian cancer</a>. <em>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</em> 2018; Epub Sep 27).</p>
<h4>Fatty Acid Metabolites</h4>
<p>Evidence suggests that inflammation increases risk for ovarian cancer. Studies of inflammatory markers, lipid molecules such as arachidonic acid, linoleic acid, and alpha linoleic acid metabolites, and development of ovarian cancer are essential to understand the potential mechanisms. A nested case-control study within the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial found that five out of 31 fatty acid metabolites (8-HETE, 12,13-DHOME, 13-HODE, 9-HODE, and 9,12,13-THOME) were associated with increased ovarian cancer risk. 8-HETE is produced by the metabolism of arachidonic acid and four metabolites (12,13-DHOME, 13-HODE, 9-HODE), and 9,12,13-THOME, are derived from linoleic acid oxidation. Further supporting the individual metabolite associations, a meta-analysis found that linoleic acid pathways increased ovarian cancer risk. The identification of these risk-related fatty acid metabolites provides mechanistic insights into the etiology of ovarian cancer and indicates the direction for future research. (Hada M, Edin ML, Hartge P, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262599">Pre-diagnostic serum levels of fatty acid metabolites and risk of ovarian cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial</a>. <em>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</em> 2018; Epub Sep 27).</p>

<h3><a id="Physical-Activity"></a>Physical Activity</h3>
<h4>Energy Expenditure</h4>
<p>A study of 1,020 adults who completed previous-day recalls that provided a profile of time spent in sedentary and physical activity was used to evaluate physical activity energy expenditure for each type of day (exercise, prolonged TV, work). Exercise days had more physical activity energy expenditure, but because of reductions in other activities (i.e., household, work, and shopping activities), only about half of the energy expended during exercise was added to total daily physical activity energy expenditure. Prolonged TV viewing days had less physical activity energy expenditure and less moderate-vigorous activity. (Matthews CE, Keadle SK, Saint-Maurice PF, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30031635">Use of time and energy on exercise, prolonged tv viewing, and work days</a>. <em>Am J Prev Med</em> 2018 Sep; Epub Jul 19).</p>
<h4>Estrogen Metabolism</h4>
<p>Lowering endogenous estrogen levels is one mechanism whereby physical activity may lower postmenopausal breast cancer risk. Several prospective studies have suggested that increased 2-hydroxylation of estrogens may also reduce postmenopausal breast cancer risk, but whether exercise alters estrogen metabolism through this mechanism is unclear. Investigators measured total circulating concentrations of parent estrogens (estrone, estradiol) and 13 estrogen metabolites, among 153 postmenopausal women randomized to 12-months of moderate-vigorous exercise and 153 controls. Although women randomized to exercise averaged 178 minutes/week of exercise over 12 months, with cardiorespiratory fitness 13% greater than controls at 12 months and total estradiol reduced by 10%, there were no significant effects of exercise on circulating concentrations of estrogen metabolites in the 2-, 4-, or 16-pathways, or on the 2-pathway/parent estrogens ratio. However, they observed a significant association between increased fitness and reduced concentration of 2-pathway metabolites. The protective effect of exercise on postmenopausal breast cancer is unlikely to be mediated by changes in estrogen metabolism. (Matthews CE, Sampson JN, Brenner DR, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30108098">Effects of exercise and cardiorespiratory fitness on estrogen metabolism in postmenopausal women. </a><em>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</em> 2018; Epub Aug 14).</p>
<h4>White Blood Cell Counts</h4>
<p>Data collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were used to assess blood cell counts in relation to objectively measured physical activity and sedentary time. Higher levels of moderate-vigorous physical activity and lower sedentary time were associated with lower white blood cell counts. These results suggest that modifiable health behaviors, such as physical activity and sedentary time, may be associated with inflammatory status through white blood cell counts, which may be important for future disease risk. (Willis EA, Shearer JJ, Matthews CE, et al. <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30252884">Association of physical activity and sedentary time with blood cell counts: National Health and Nutrition Survey 2003-2006</a>. <em>PLoS One</em> 2018 Sep 25).</p>

<h4>Risk Factors by Race</h4>
<p>Race-specific prostate cancer risk associations were examined among men in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Risks were found to be similar among black and white men across disease subtypes only for history of diabetes (hazard ratio (HR)=0.77 and HR=0.72, respectively). In contrast, there was a positive risk association with height for white men and inverse for black men. This difference remained for at least two years of follow-up among men diagnosed with&nbsp;non-advanced disease, but not for men with advanced disease or after adjustment for prostate cancer screening. The only other evidence of interaction with race was observed for dietary vitamin D intake and non-advanced disease, but only after adjustment for screening. Cumulative adjustment for each factor increased the HR for black race by 32.9% for overall cancer and 12.4% for advanced disease. These data suggest few of the dietary, nutrient, and health-related factors associated with prostate cancer risk among predominantly non-Hispanic white men were associated with risk among black men, and adjustment for these factors widen the black-white difference in risk. Larger studies of black men, particularly with prospective data, are needed to help identify risk factors relevant to this population.

<h4>Circulating Inflammation Markers</h4>
<p>Chronic <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> (<em>H. pylori</em>) infection causes gastric mucosal inflammation, an important antecedent of gastric cancer. Investigators compared pre-treatment serum levels of immune- and inflammation-related markers between 99 individuals with intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia, and 75 control individuals with non-atrophic gastritis within an <em>H. pylori</em> eradication trial in Mexico. Five markers were associated with the presence of advanced premalignant gastric lesions: CCL3/MIP1a, CCL20/MIP3a, IL1&beta;, IL4, and IL5. Two (IL4 and IL5) of the five markers had false discovery rate adjusted p-trend &lt;0.2. The results suggest certain Th2 and other cytokines may have a role in promoting carcinogenesis in the setting of H. pylori infection. (Song M, Rabkin CS, Torres J, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30357905">Circulating inflammation-related markers and advanced gastric premalignant lesions</a>. <em>J Gastroenterol Hepatol</em> 2018; Epub Oct 24).</p>
<h4>Epstein-Barr Virus</h4>
<p>Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-positive gastric adenocarcinoma exhibits locally intense inflammation but systemic manifestations are uncertain. This study examined whether circulating mediators of inflammation and immune response differ by tumor EBV status among a Latvian series of 302 gastric cancer cases. After measuring plasma levels of 92 immune-related proteins in the 28 patients with EBV-positive tumors and 34 patients with EBV-negative tumors, eight markers were significantly higher with tumor EBV positivity: chemokine C-C motif ligand (CCL) 20 (Odds Ratio (OR)=3.6), chemokine C-X-C motif ligand 9 (OR=3.6), programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1; OR=3.4), interleukin (IL)-10 (OR=2.4), CCL19 (OR=2.3), CCL11 (OR=2.2), IL-17A (OR=2.0) and CCL8 (OR=1.9). Systemic responses to EBV-positive gastric cancer are characterized by alterations in chemokines and PD-L1. Profiling of these molecules may enable non-invasive diagnosis of EBV status when tumor tissue is unavailable. Our findings provide theoretical justification for clinical evaluations of immune checkpoint therapy for EBV-positive gastric cancer.

<h4><em>H. pylori</em> Serum Biomarkers</h4>
<p>In populations with a high prevalence of the known carcinogen <em>H. pylori</em> and a high incidence of gastric cancer, biomarkers are needed to identify individuals at highest risk of developing cancer for targeted eradication. In this study, investigators identified, replicated, and validated two novel <em>H. pylori</em> biomarkers for gastric cancer risk in East Asia, Omp and HP0305. These biomarkers will help develop a high-risk classification model for targeted <em>H. pylori</em> eradication schemes, beyond use of the established risk marker CagA. Moreover, they can be easily measured and result in better prediction than models that include larger panels of biomarkers that are more cost- and time-intensive to assay.

<p>Tenure-track investigator <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/trabert-britton">Britton Trabert, Ph.D., M.S.</a>, studies the epidemiology of ovarian cancer and the hormonal etiology of gynecologic cancers. As part of her multidisciplinary research program in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch, Dr. Trabert is leading studies to understand the etiologic heterogeneity of ovarian cancer by histologic type. She employs classic and molecular epidemiologic research approaches to identify strategies for disease prevention or earlier disease detection.</p>
<h3><strong>Ovarian Cancer Epidemiology</strong></h3>
<p>Ovarian cancer is the most fatal gynecologic malignancy and the fifth leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States. Most ovarian cancers are diagnosed at advanced stages and have an exceedingly poor five-year survival rate of 28%. Researchers have yet to discover predictive biomarkers for early detection, in part because ovarian cancer is rare, making prospective studies challenging to perform.</p>
<p>Until recently, scientists theorized that ovarian cancer arose from 1) microtrauma to the ovarian epithelium (outer layer) resulting from uninterrupted ovulation and 2) exposure to high levels of gonadotropin&mdash;a hormone secreted by the pituitary gland that stimulates the ovaries. These hypotheses were based on the observed reduced risk of ovarian cancer with increasing parity (having borne children), oral contraceptive use, and breastfeeding&mdash;all of which interrupt ovulation and alter pituitary function.</p>

<p>Over the last decade, the understanding of the origin of ovarian cancer has changed dramatically. Many high-grade serous tumors&mdash;the most common and lethal subtype&mdash;have been shown to develop in the fimbria of the fallopian tubes before proliferating on the surface of the ovary.</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert recently examined trends in fallopian tube cancers using the largest source of population-based data for cancer incidence: the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). She noted dramatic increases in the reporting patterns of primary fallopian tube cancers, which are likely due to a shift in primary cancer designation (from ovarian to fallopian tube), not a true increase in incidence of these malignancies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are experiencing a paradigm shift,&rdquo; Dr. Trabert said. &ldquo;There is more pathologic evidence related to the origins of ovarian cancer from the fallopian tubes, which has altered both surgical approaches to treatment and prevention as well as etiologic investigation. We are realizing that ovarian cancer etiology could be quite heterogeneous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert and colleagues suspect that inflammation may be a key player in cancer development in the ovaries and fallopian tubes. Her research focuses on clarifying the role of both systemic and local (tubal) inflammation in ovarian carcinogenesis by histologic subtype.</p>
<h4>Circulating markers of inflammation and sexually transmitted infections</h4>
<p>Chronic or persistent inflammation in the body is known to be associated with an increased risk of cancer and other diseases. To explore the role of systemic inflammation, Dr. Trabert conducted a nested case-control study within the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer (PLCO) Screening Trial to evaluate prediagnostic levels of 46 circulating cytokines and other immune markers and ovarian cancer risk. She found that elevated levels of CRP, IL-8, and TNF-&alpha; were associated with a doubling of risk for ovarian cancer&mdash;stronger than many established risk factors.</p>
<p>To assess the effect of local, tubal inflammation arising from sexually transmitted infections and pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), Dr. Trabert and colleagues recently completed a study to characterize the association between ovarian cancer risk and prior infection with <em>Chlamydia trachomatis, </em>one of the primary causes of PID worldwide, as well as markers of other infections, using a novel sensitive multiplex serology assay. This work was supported by funding from an NCI Director&rsquo;s Intramural Innovation Award. Dr. Trabert measured serologic markers of prior infection in two independent studies: a population-based case-control study (the Polish Ovarian Cancer study) and a nested case-control study in PLCO. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The gold-standard serologic marker for prior chlamydia infection, the plasmid-encoded Pgp3 protein, was consistently associated with increased ovarian cancer risk across the study populations,&rdquo; Dr. Trabert said. &ldquo;Our results for markers of other infections were universally null, further supporting the specificity of the chlamydia-ovarian cancer association.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert noted that the team&rsquo;s novel approach to measuring serologic markers of prior infection is an innovative solution to reliance on clinical diagnoses or self-reports of PID, data that are largely unavailable or unreliable in large epidemiologic studies.</p>
<h4>Anti-inflammatory medication use</h4>

<p>If inflammation increases risk of ovarian cancer, could the use of anti-inflammatory medication have a protective effect? Previous research suggests that the anti-inflammatory properties of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) may reduce overall cancer risk. However, studies examining the role of these agents in ovarian cancer have been largely inconclusive.</p>
<p>Dr. Trabert led an analysis of pooled data from 12 large epidemiological studies within the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium (OCAC); she and collaborators found that daily aspirin use was associated with a 20% reduction in ovarian cancer risk [OR (95% CI): 0.80 (0.67-0.96)]. They recently confirmed this association in data from 13 prospective studies within the Ovarian Cancer Cohort Consortium (OC3).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our studies suggest that inflammation is potentially modifiable, and that aspirin regimens may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer,&rdquo; Dr. Trabert said. &ldquo;We are incrementally building toward aspirin as a viable chemopreventive agent for this malignancy, alongside oral contraceptives.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><strong>Hormonal Etiology of Gynecologic Cancers</strong></h3>
<p>As evidenced by associations with menopausal hormone therapy and oral contraceptive use, hormonal factors play an important role in ovarian, endometrial, and breast cancers. However, the underlying carcinogenic mechanisms are not well understood. Surprisingly little is known about the role of endogenous hormones in ovarian and endometrial carcinogenesis, and although the role of circulating estrogens/estrogen metabolites in breast cancer etiology is established, few studies on circulating androgens and/or progesterone are available.</p>
<h4>Endogenous hormones and assay development</h4>
<p>Dr. Trabert recently led a nested case-control study analysis within the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Observational Study (WHIOS) to evaluate the role of estrogen metabolism in ovarian and endometrial cancers. &ldquo;The results of the ovarian cancer analyses demonstrated striking histologic subtype heterogeneity in risks, with results supporting a role for estrogen metabolites in the etiology of nonserous tumors, but not serous tumors,&rdquo; Dr. Trabert said. Endometrial cancer risk was associated with increased concentrations of both parent estrogens and metabolites. Dr. Trabert also has directed several research projects evaluating associations between known cancer risk factors and circulating estrogen metabolites using data from the WHIOS.</p>

<p>Surprisingly little is known about the role of endogenous hormones in ovarian and endometrial carcinogenesis.</p>
</div>
<p>There is emerging recognition of the contribution of other hormones, such as androgens and progesterone, in the etiology of gynecologic cancers. To further facilitate her research in this area, Dr. Trabert led a multidisciplinary project to develop two novel hormone assays with colleagues at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. These assays measure androgens and androgen metabolites, and progesterone and progesterone metabolites, which are complementary to the estrogen metabolite assay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Importantly, these assays target sex steroid hormones and their metabolites that are likely relevant to female cancer etiology. It was necessary to develop these methods since clinical assays are not routinely available or are not sensitive enough to measure levels in postmenopausal women,&rdquo; she noted.</p>
<p>Eager to utilize the new assays, Dr. Trabert is leading analyses of androgen/androgen metabolites and ovarian and endometrial cancer in the WHIOS and a similar study of breast cancer within the Bone Density and Cancer Risk Follow-up Study of Women in the Fracture Intervention Trial (BFIT).</p>
<p>&ldquo;These studies will enable the evaluation of female cancer risk in relation to previously unmeasured androgen metabolites and estimate associations independent of the effects of downstream estrogens,&rdquo; Dr. Trabert said. In addition, she is leading novel investigations relating progesterone/progesterone metabolites to breast, ovarian, endometrial, and colorectal cancer in BFIT.</p>
<h4>Exogenous hormones</h4>
<p>Dr. Trabert also investigates exogenous hormone-related risk factors in female cancers, including the long-term effects of oral contraceptive use and infertility treatment.</p>

<p>Gynecologic oncologists generally recommend that women concerned about their ovarian cancer risk should take at least five years of combined (containing estrogen and progestin) oral contraceptives for chemoprevention. However, the magnitude of benefit remains unclear, given the small increases in breast and cervical cancer risk and increased risks of deep vein thrombosis and/or stroke among current or recent oral contraceptive users. Furthermore, scientists are uncertain whether the effects of oral contraceptives on ovarian and endometrial cancer are consistent across population subgroups, such as smokers and obese women.</p>
<p>To address these gaps, Dr. Trabert and postdoctoral fellow <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/meb-fellows#Michels">Kara Michels, Ph.D.</a>, published two important papers on the alterations in cancer risk associated with oral contraceptive use. First, they analyzed data from nearly 200,000 women from the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study to investigate whether the relationship between oral contraceptive use and risks for ovarian, endometrial, breast, and colorectal cancers change depending on health behaviors in the years leading up to and during menopause (for example, smoking, alcohol use, body mass index, and physical activity).</p>
<p>&ldquo;We found that long-term oral contraceptive use (10 years or longer) was associated with reduced risk for ovarian cancer regardless of other health behaviors in later life,&rdquo; Dr. Trabert said.</p>
<p>Extended oral contraceptive use also reduced risks for endometrial cancer. The most striking reduction was among women who were current smokers, obese, or rarely exercised. &ldquo;This work has the potential to refine the guidance regarding oral contraceptive use and ovarian and endometrial cancer risk,&rdquo; Dr. Trabert said.</p>
<p>Drs. Trabert and Michels followed this work with a broad examination of oral contraceptive use and risk of many different cancers using the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. They identified cancer risk reductions and increases associated with oral contraceptive use, including expected risk reductions that strengthened with duration of use for ovarian and endometrial cancers. Overall, the net effect of oral contraceptive use on all cancer types was lower risk (a 3% decrease).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oral contraceptive use did not influence risks for most other cancers evaluated,&rdquo; Dr. Trabert said. &ldquo;This was a new look at whether the beneficial, or potentially harmful, effects of oral contraceptives influenced other cancers, which has important public health implications.&rdquo;</p>
<p>On the other end of reproductive health, the success of fertility treatments has produced a generation of women with novel hormone exposures. Dr. Trabert initiated a retrospective medical record linkage study in Israel to evaluate <em>in vitro fertilization </em>(IVF) and cancer risk. Israel is a unique and opportune location for this study&mdash;they have long-term clinical records, the highest rate of fertility treatment in the world, the Ministry of Health subsidizes fertility treatments, and the country uses unique identification numbers that facilitate registry linkages. Dr. Trabert and colleagues have successfully completed a pilot study, and data collection for the full effort is ongoing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When complete, these data will comprise the largest assembled cohort of IVF exposed women (~30,000 women) with the longest follow-up to date,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Ultimately this work will inform surveillance and early detection guidelines in these women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In collaboration with the NCI Office of Communications and Public Liaison (OCPL) and the Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT), DCEG communications and scientific staff undertook a redesign of the user interface of the NCI risk assessment tools. These web tools allow health professionals to quickly assess patients&rsquo; risk of developing one of three cancers&mdash;breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma&mdash;all of which have actionable screening protocols or other interventions for early detection and prevention.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov/">breast cancer risk assessment tool</a> (BCRAT) and the&nbsp;<a href="https://ccrisktool.cancer.gov/">colorectal cancer risk assessment tool</a> (CCRAT) launched earlier this fall; the redesigned melanoma tool is expected by the end of 2018.</p>
<p>The main upgrades to these tools include a usability-tested user interface and results page, enhanced security features, fully accessible and responsive design, and adoption of the contemporary Cancer.gov web style. In addition, BCRAT was updated with data from Hispanas/Latinas; latest incidence rates will be added to the melanoma tool.</p>
<p>This set of risk communications products advance the Institute&rsquo;s mission to improve cancer prevention and detection, and make information accessible across the United States, especially in settings where access to online information is predominately possible through handheld devices that require responsive design.</p>

The findings were published online August 27, 2018 in the journal <em>European Journal of Epidemiology.</em></p>
<p>Prior to this study, it was long known that relatively high-dose exposure to ionizing radiation (greater than 0.5 Gy) can induce cataract, but there was no evidence for risk at low doses (conventionally under&thinsp;100&nbsp;mGy). To assess low-dose risk, REB investigators evaluated cataract and cataract surgery reported by participants from the large, prospective cohort, US Radiologic Technologists Study. Over 12,000 eligible technologists reported a history of diagnosis of cataract during over 830,000 person-years of follow-up; over 5,500 reported undergoing cataract surgery over a similar follow-up period. The results were adjusted for most of the standard&nbsp;cataract risk factors, including age, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, and cumulative exposure to ultraviolet radiation. Cumulative occupational radiation dose to the eye lens was associated with increased risk of cataract in this cohort, even at low doses (less than 100&nbsp;mGy). This finding challenges the expert opinion of national and international review committees regarding the threshold dose for cataract formation, and further raises the question of whether such a threshold exists.</p>
<p>This report provides an update to a prior analysis by REB researchers of the same cohort. This time, the investigators had an additional nine years of data, and a more sophisticated, improved dosimetry.</p>

<p>In October 2018, Dale Sandler, Ph.D., head of the Chronic Disease Epidemiology group and chief of the Epidemiology Branch of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS), spent two days with DCEG staff and fellows as a Visiting Scholar. <br /><br />The highlight of her visit was the well-attended seminar, &ldquo;Prospective Studies of Environment and Health,&rdquo; hosted by senior investigator, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=27&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349661" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349661" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7277630" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349661">Laura Beane-Freeman, Ph.D.</a>, Dr. Sandler began by briefly summarizing <a href="https://sisterstudy.niehs.nih.gov/English/index1.htm">The Sister Study</a>&nbsp;and the NIEHS-led research within the&nbsp;<a href="https://aghealth.nih.gov/">Agricultural Health Study</a> (AHS), a joint initiative with NCI, and extending&nbsp;an invitation for future collaborations. She focused the remainder of her talk on the design, execution, and results of the <a href="https://gulfstudy.nih.gov/en/index.html">Gulf Long-term Follow-up Study</a> (GuLF), a massive undertaking she coordinated to investigate health effects among workers involved in the clean up of the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil rig disaster in the Gulf of Mexcio. <br /><br />&ldquo;It was a whirlwind experience that was exciting and high-stakes from the beginning,&rdquo; Dr. Sandler explained, &ldquo;Within just a week after I submitted a rough proposal to NIH Director Dr. Francis Collins, he announced to Congress that he would fund the study with $10 million from his Director&rsquo;s Fund, and appointed me to lead it.&rdquo; <br /><br />Dr. Sandler went on to describe the numerous challenges she and her team faced in standing-up such a complex investigation. The protocol needed accelerated review in order to get into the field as soon after the disaster as possible. As a result of GuLF study, there are now procedures in place to fast-track IRB approval for disaster response. <br /><br />Dr. Sandler and her team focused on clean-up workers with the greatest exposure to oil and chemical dispersants. From 2011- 2013, starting less than a year after the oil spill, they enrolled over 32,000 adults. They conducted home visits, telephone follow-ups and clinical exams. Despite the accelerated timeline, many of the individuals involved in clean-up were already gone by the team arrived in the Gulf. The study population was not typical by any means&mdash;it was not solely occupational, nor was it a distinctive community, but a mix of the two. Nevertheless, they designed the study with limited information and committed to modifying it along the way as they gained more knowledge. <br /><br />&ldquo;Characterizing exposures, determining which to measure and how to adequately measure them were and are some of the most significant challenges,&rdquo; Dr. Sandler said, &ldquo;because of how varied each individual&rsquo;s experience was in the clean-up. It was hard to really know what people did.&rdquo; The study team decided to look at exposure to hydrocarbons, burning oil, chemical dispersants, heat stress, and psychological stress, among others, and the correlation of these exposures with about 25 symptoms. <br /><br />Most notable was the observation of a dramatic decrease in lung function with exposure to burning oil and gas, especially among decontamination workers. At the initial home visit, these workers experienced an average 183 mL reduction in FEV1, a measure of lung function, but those numbers appeared to improve in the follow-up clinical exam. <br /><br />There was some correlation with chemical dispersants and eye and respiratory symptoms in individuals that lived near the areas where these were used. Mental health was also a consideration. There was an increased risk of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression among people who worked on the clean-up, but it was unclear whether these originatied from exposure to chemical or psychological stress. Heat stress may have been a considerable but not permanent factor in cardiac events, but the data also show an association between hydrocarbon exposure and heart attack that continues to increase over time. Finally, despite reports of increased deaths due to the effects of the oil spill, they found no evidence of increased mortality rates or cancer incidence rates.<br /><br />In closing her talk, Dr. Sandler encouraged senior staff and postdoctoral fellows to pursue and engage in multi-disciplinary research collaboration, highlighting&nbsp;the ample opportunities for growth and improved science.&nbsp;<br /><br />During her visit, Dr. Sandler met with several investigators and fellows to discuss research and collaborations. She participated in a roundtable discussion with DCEG staff and fellows, entitled &ldquo;Epidemiology of Female Cancers: Opportunities for Collaboration,&rdquo; hosted by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=802306" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="802306" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7277631" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="802306">Britton Trabert, Ph.D., M.S.</a>, Earl Stadtman Investigator, and staff scientist, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1125018" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="1125018" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7277632" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="1125018">Clara Bodelon, Ph.D., M.S.</a>&nbsp;Dr. Sandler shared her insights from the NIEHS Sister Study, and answered questions about the creation of cohort studies, collaborative opportunities in research on cancer survivors, intermediate endpoints, and cancer precursor conditions.

<p>In October 2018, Regina G. Ziegler, Ph.D., M.P.H., retired after nearly 40 years of service to the National Cancer Institute. Dr. Ziegler is widely recognized for her expertise in nutritional epidemiology, incorporating circulating biomarkers into epidemiologic studies, and facilitating the development of assays needed by cancer epidemiologists.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Ziegler received a B.A. from Swarthmore College, a Ph.D. in biochemistry from the University of California at Berkeley, and a M.P.H. from the Harvard School of Public Health. After graduate school, she taught international nutrition and global food resources courses at Yale, Harvard, and Tufts Universities. She joined the National Cancer Institute in 1979, was tenured in 1987, and has served most recently as a senior investigator in the Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program.</p>
<p>Throughout her career, Dr. Ziegler&rsquo;s research has focused broadly on dietary, nutritional, anthropometric, and hormonal determinants of cancer risk. Her early work helped characterize the role of vegetables and fruits, individual carotenoids, folate, and one-carbon metabolism in cancer etiology. In addition, she has conducted a number of breast cancer studies with emphasis on anthropometry, diet, and endogenous hormones and growth factors. For example, Dr. Ziegler helped design and direct a large, population-based case-control study of breast cancer in Asian-American women to elucidate the modifiable exposures, related to lifestyle and/or environment, that explained the six-fold difference in breast cancer incidence between Asia and the West. More recently, she collaboratively developed an international pooled analysis of circulating vitamin D concentrations in relation to risk of colorectal and breast cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Ziegler has applied her training in chemistry and biochemistry to the development of new and improved methods for measuring various hormones and nutrients in epidemiologic studies. Recently, she played a critical role in the successful development of a sensitive assay for assessment of estrogen metabolites and a validated assay for concurrent measurement of the major steroid hormones.</p>
<p>Dr. Ziegler is a fellow of the American Society for Nutrition and helped establish its Nutritional Epidemiology Research Interest Section. She currently serves on the editorial boards of the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute </em>and the <em>Nutrition Action Healthletter, </em>and previously served on the editorial boards of the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, </em>the<em> Journal of Nutrition, </em>and<em> Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, and Prevention</em>. She received a NIH Merit Award for her research on the role of vegetables, fruits, and micronutrients in the etiology of a variety of cancers.</p>

<p>In the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), investigators study a range of factors that influence risk for cancer. Epidemiologists have made profound discoveries by measuring potential carcinogens and correlating them with cancer outcomes&mdash;for example, the associations of obesity and physical activity with cancer. Despite clear, causal evidence for some exposure-disease relationships, the effects they have on the human body&mdash;the carcinogenic process itself&mdash;remain largely a mystery.</p>
<p>All exposures we study affect our metabolism, the chemical processes that are needed to maintain life: breaking down nutrients, eliminating toxins, or building tissue. For example, protein, carbohydrates, and fat in the food we eat are metabolized into amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids, providing the building blocks of cells and tissue, compounds synthesized by our bodies for normal functioning, and the fuel to keep us going at a cellular level. When these processes work in harmony, we produce sufficient enzymes to process the &ldquo;raw material.&rdquo; When there is too much of a certain material, the body may take a &lsquo;non-standard&rsquo; approach to breaking down those large molecules, producing intermediate compounds that may affect health.</p>
<p>These substances circulate throughout the body in a person&rsquo;s blood, urine, and other biospecimens. Metabolomics&mdash;the study of these compounds and their relationships in a living organism&mdash;provides a new avenue for exploration. Cell culture or animal studies can only take us so far in our understanding of the inner workings of the body. By measuring metabolites in biospecimens, researchers can uncover clues about a person&rsquo;s underlying physiologic state.</p>

<p>Over the past eight years, a multidisciplinary team made up of DCEG epidemiologists, biochemists, experts in nutritional studies, and biostatisticians, have been evaluating the performance of metabolomics assays&nbsp;and applying them to studies of cancer etiology. They have utilized metabolomics to improve measurement of key epidemiologic exposures (e.g. diet), enable assessment of mediating mechanisms (e.g. intermediaries such as estrogen that are associated with both obesity and cancer risk), and identify novel pathways of cancer initiation or progression.</p>

Newer technologies allow a broader, agnostic approach to analysis that could accelerate rate of discovery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As of this writing, investigators have reported on 1,000 or more metabolites, often in studies of thousands of participants. The ability to do this on such a large scale&mdash;both in terms of the quantity of metabolites and the number of participants studied&mdash;depends upon sophisticated statistical tools.</p>

Given the new application of metabolomics in epidemiology, Dr. Sampson and his post-doctoral fellow, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/bb-fellows#Derkach">Andriy Derkach, Ph.D.</a>, are developing novel methods to identify metabolic profiles that are either predictive of disease or that can offer insight into why known risk factors are associated with disease. Dr. Derkach adds, &ldquo;Metabolites can give us a window into the underlying biological processes causing disease. Advances in statistical methodology will greatly facilitate our ability to peer through that window.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Intriguing results begin to accumulate</strong></p>
<p>Metabolomics has great value in complementing and extending exposure assessment methods in nutritional studies. Early results show reliable concordance with dietary intake, suggesting biomarker measurement can be used to validate data collected through food frequency questionnaires, and both can be used in concert to evaluate the effects of diet on health<sup>2-9</sup>.</p>
<p>Former MEB postdoctoral fellow and NCI K99/00 Pathway to Independence Award winner <a href="https://faculty.utah.edu/u6017378-Mary_C_Playdon,_PhD/research/index.hml">Mary Playdon, Ph.D.</a>, now at the Huntsman Cancer Institute at the University of Utah, applies metabolomics to the study of diet and health. In preliminary findings, she observed that variations in the amount or presence of these molecules directly impact human health, disease risk, and disease progression.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This approach can help us explore how food, vitamin supplements, and medications interact over the course of disease progression,&rdquo; said Dr. Playdon. &ldquo;We can evaluate how exercise and sedentary behavior influence metabolism and disease risk; and study the interaction of the human metabolome, genome, and microbiome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Together with Dr. Moore, she showed correlations between incomplete breakdown of branched-chain amino acids, BMI, and increased risk for breast cancer<sup>10</sup>, a pattern that ties well with emerging literature suggesting a role for perturbed metabolism of amino acids in cancer progression. According to recent work by cancer biologists, incomplete metabolism of amino acids may result in a surplus of &ldquo;building-blocks&rdquo; that nascent cancer cells can coopt to make more cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To achieve sufficient statistical power, the investigators needed large numbers of carefully curated, prospective data&mdash;biospecimens, questionnaire data and disease outcomes. Drs. Moore and Stolzenberg-Solomon, have taken on leadership roles as the founding chair and secretary, respectively, of the <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/comets/">Consortium of METabolomic Studies</a> (COMETS), an extramural-intramural partnership that&nbsp;promotes collaboration among investigators leading prospective cohort studies. To date, 50 cohorts have joined COMETS, with over 150,000 participants in all. &ldquo;Seventy percent have genome-wide association studies&nbsp;data as well,&rdquo; Dr. Moore points out, &ldquo;which will be critical for examining any correlations between the metabolome and the genome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The large number of cohorts and the population diversity within them also make replication studies possible. &ldquo;Since many biospecimens have already been collected in existing cohorts,&rdquo; said Dr. Moore, &ldquo;and in some cases are already metabolically profiled, this research can often be pursued at no or minimal additional cost.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Challenges and opportunities in metabolomics</strong></p>
<p>As in any new field of research, there remain a number of obstacles to overcome as well as promising avenues to pursue.</p>
<p>"Great attention needs to be paid to standardization of handling samples,&rdquo; cautioned Dr. Stolzenberg-Solomon. &ldquo;Differences in the way the samples are stored, thawed, and aliquoted prior to running the assays may affect the measurement of metabolite levels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Methods and assays will need to be validated for the study of long-term biomarkers in hair, nails, and blood protein; food-drug interactions; and to disentangle the interplay of the gut microbiome and metabolome in human health.</p>
<p>In planning for future studies, Dr. Moore notes, &ldquo;tools for effective data harmonization will be increasingly essential. Current assays typically yield only relative concentrations, not absolute measures; however, if results are to be useful for comparison with later studies, absolute quantitative values are needed.&rdquo; MEB senior investigators, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=18&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349692" sys_contentid="349692" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349692" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7157308">Rashmi Sinha, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=24&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349637" sys_contentid="349637" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349637" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7157309">Katherine McGlynn, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, and postdoctoral fellows, <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/meb-fellows#Loftfield">Erikka Loftfield, Ph.D.</a>, and <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/fellowship-training/what-our-fellows-do/meet-current-fellows/meb-fellows#Petrick">Jessica Petrick, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, have begun this work on short-chain fatty acids and bile acids.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there is much to learn about the interactions between chemical classes, as well as the role of exposures like vitamins, obesity, and smoking. Improved technology will also expand our ability to look more specifically at chemical class panels, moving from untargeted discovery to focused platforms, such as lipids and coffee metabolites.</p>
<p>Dr. Playdon explained, &ldquo;right now we are only able to perform -omics studies on a double-level; that is, comparing two -omics profiles at a time. Eventually, we hope to achieve the ability to look at many, if not all of them at once (i.e. genomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, including proteomics and lipidomics, and the microbiome). Doing this will enable us to answer questions more comprehensively with the full power of multiple areas of research.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Congress created the EEOICPA of 2000 to compensate workers in the atomic energy and nuclear weapons fields for the harms they suffered as a consequence of radiation or chemical exposure in the workplace. To implement the Act, HHS (through the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) carries out the SEC assessments used by the Department of Labor to determine medical benefits and compensation payments to the workers or to certain survivors, if applicable. In cases in which the HHS Secretary decides to deny adding a class of workers to the SEC, EEOICPA supporting regulations permit those workers to request Administrative Review of the case, a function carried out by the Office of the Assistant Secretary for Health. Between 2010 and 2018, Dr. Simon served as an invited expert on four panels to review the Secretary&rsquo;s decisions about exposure and compensation and chaired three of the panels.</p>

<p>Tobacco products are estimated to cause seven million deaths per year worldwide, including 480,000 deaths from cigarette smoking alone. Even though smoking rates have declined over the last few decades, about 15% of US adults currently smoke and 39% smoked regularly at some point in their life. Additionally, an estimated 189 million adults, worldwide, smoke tobacco &ldquo;occasionally&rdquo; but not every day. However, few studies have examined how non-daily smoking and changes in the number of cigarettes smoked per day over the lifetime affect mortality. DCEG investigators conducted two studies to begin addressing this gap in knowledge.</p>
<p>In a study published in <em>American Journal of Preventive Medicine</em> on October 24, 2018, investigators reported that lifelong non-daily cigarette smokers who had never smoked daily were 1.7 times more likely to die from any cause during the follow-up period than never smokers. Additionally, relative to never smokers, lifelong non-daily smokers lived five years less and daily smokers lived ten years less. The data came from the 1991, 1992, and 1995 U.S. National Health Interview Surveys (NHIS), a nationally representative sample of 70,913 U.S. adults (aged 18&ndash;95 years), as well as additional supplements that collected more detailed information on smoking habits.</p>
<p>A second study published in <em>American Journal of Epidemiology</em> on October 9, 2018, examined the impact of changes in the number of cigarettes smoked per day (CPD) on risk of all-cause and cause-specific mortality. The authors noted a dose-response with changes in CPD: risk of death during the follow-up period was lowest among never smokers and progressively increased among former smokers, those who reduced their CPD but did not quit, those who maintained a consistent CPD, and those who increased their CPD from ages 25-29 to 50-59. Notably, relative to never smokers, participants who only decreased their CPD but did not quit were more than twice as likely to die from any cause. The data came from over 250,000 participants in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study.</p>
<p>These results may also have implications for risk prediction. Currently, eligibility for lung cancer screening is typically determined based on life-time pack-years of exposure, the product of smoking duration, and typical or recent CPD. These studies demonstrate that lung cancer mortality risk varies substantially with changes in CPD over the lifetime. Models that incorporate CPD at just a single time in life may not optimally identify people who should be screened for lung cancer.</p>

<p>Brain and other central nervous system (CNS) cancers are the leading cause of pediatric cancer mortality in the US. A new study published November 21, 2018, in the journal <em>Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention, </em>reports stable incidence rates among children aged 0 to 19 years in the U.S. between 1998 and 2013, though statistically-significant changes were reported for several sub-types.</p>
<p>The findings were based on a total of 18,612 pediatric malignant CNS cancers and 6,856 non-malignant pilocytic astrocytomas reported between 1998 and 2013 to the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. There was no significant change in incidence for all malignant CNS cancers combined. Glioma and pilocytic astrocytoma incidence rates increased by 0.77 percent/year and 0.89 percent/year, respectively; CNS embryonal cancer rates decreased by 0.88 percent/year. Investigators estimated these changes in incidence rates resulted in 120 excess gliomas, 94 excess pilocytic astrocytomas, and 72 fewer embryonal CNS tumors, compared to what would have been expected if rates had remained stable over the time period. Changes in diagnosis and classification methods make it difficult to differentiate whether the modest trends observed in this study are a result of true changes in incidence, or changes in identification, reporting, and classification.</p>

<p>A new report, &ldquo;Pediatric Considerations Before, During, and After Radiological/Nuclear Emergencies,&rdquo; published in the November 2018 issue of <em>Pediatrics</em>, summarizes appropriate management of the pediatric population in the event of a radiologic disaster. The material was developed by an expert panel convened by the Council on Environmental Health of the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), and supports the revised AAP recommendations first issued in 2003. Clinicians and public health advocates alike can benefit from this latest review of the science; the detailed guidance can be applied in the clinic and when prioritizing health policy. <br /><br />The authors review the evidence-base for measures to reduce radiation exposure in the immediate aftermath of a radiological or nuclear disaster, including diagnosis and management of external and internal contamination, use of potassium iodide, and actions in relation to breastfeeding. They describe public health and clinical implications and emphasize the importance of awareness and management of acute radiation syndrome, acute and long-term psychologic effects, as well as cancer risks and other late tissue reactions following low-to-high levels of radiation exposure. <br /><br />These latest recommendations are based on a thorough review of highly-respected studies of exposed populations, including the Japanese atomic bomb survivors, individuals exposed through nuclear plant accidents or improper disposal of radiotherapy equipment, and residence in proximity to nuclear plants.</p>

<p>The DCEG Exemplary Service Award is given to honor a Division scientist who combines sustained research accomplishments with outstanding service to NCI. This year&rsquo;s award was given to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349670" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349670" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7174522" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349670">Sanford M. Dawsey, M.D.</a>, in honor of his outstanding research on esophageal and gastric cancer. His work has expanded our knowledge of these malignancies and led to breakthrough early detection techniques for these highly fatal cancers. His pioneering work led to a practical endoscopic screening technique that is being widely used in China to detect preneoplastic lesions and early cancers. Most recently, he turned his organizing and energizing skills into forming the African Esophageal Cancer Consortium. This multi-institution group is bringing much needed attention to understanding the causes of and methods for palliating this devastating and common disease that afflicts people throughout Eastern and Southern Africa. Finally, he is an outstanding mentor who helps fellow and junior and senior scientists in the Metabolomic Epidemiology Branch, across the Division, and throughout the world.</p>
<h3>NCI Director's Innovation Awards</h3>
<p>The NCI Director's Innovation Awards are designed to support the development of novel approaches and technologies for accelerating cancer research. These include Principal Investigator (PI) Awards, which are given to tenure-track or recently tenured PIs (within five years of tenure), and Career Development Awards, which are given to postdoctoral fellows, staff scientists, staff clinicians, and senior scientists. Nine DCEG scientists received awards and increased research funding, as listed below:</p>

<p>In a follow-up to a long-term study of Chinese workers exposed to benzene, DCEG researchers observed increased&nbsp;risks for the combined grouping of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) with increasing cumulative exposure among individuals whose first exposure occurred before age 30, and whose exposure came within 10 years of diagnosis. They reported little evidence of exposure-response among workers exposed 10 or more years prior to diagnosis, regardless of age at first exposure. The&nbsp;risk for chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) was increased in exposed versus unexposed workers, but appeared to increase and then decrease with increasing exposure. The findings were published December 6, 2018, in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em>.</p>
<p>There is international consensus that benzene exposure is causally related to AML, and more recent evidence of risk for MDS. However, there have been uncertainties about the exposure-response, particularly for risk by time since exposure and age at exposure. In this study, DCEG investigators applied novel, sophisticated statistical analysis to evaluate the combined risk for MDS/AML and for CML in a case-cohort study of 110,000 Chinese workers (followed between 1972-1999).</p>

<p>On December 11, 2018, Professor Helga &Ouml;gmundsd&oacute;ttir from the University of Iceland presented a seminar, &ldquo;<em>Genetic predisposition to&nbsp;Waldenstr&ouml;m's macrogl&aelig;obulinemia - lessons from family studies</em>&rdquo;.&nbsp; Prof. &Ouml;gmundsd&oacute;ttir, an immunologist, has a longtime interest in the study of the genetic and biological basis of B cell-derived malignancies. During her seminar, she described functional studies of B-cell activation in families with Waldenstr&ouml;m macroglobulinemia (WM) and its precursor condition, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, in particular her discovery that B-cells from apparently unaffected relatives of WM patients were hyper-responsive to stimulation from exposure to certain compounds.

<p>Women undergoing routine cervical cancer screening who test positive for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection or related cytologic (Pap) abnormalities, after a history of negative cotests, have very low risk of developing precancer or cancer from that new abnormality, according to researchers at the National Cancer Institute, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, and Kaiser Permanente Northern California. This study, published December 21, 2018, in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute,</em> considers, for the first time, the impact of multiple negative cotests on the risk of precancer following a newly positive screen, and the results show a strong and progressive decrease in risk of all positive findings when they are preceded by negative cotests.</p>
<p>The impact of prior negative screening was seen for all subsequent abnormal results, even high-grade abnormalities. For example, the authors noted that women who screened newly positive for HPV and presented with positive, low-risk abnormalities (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) had sufficiently low risk of developing precancer or cancer to consider a future recommendation of surveillance, rather than colposcopy (more intense visual inspection under magnification, with biopsy of visually suspicious lesions).</p>
<p>The findings confirm and reflect the natural history of HPV and cervical carcinogenesis. New infections with HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer, are typically benign. The body manages the infection without acquiring cell changes that may go on to become cancerous. When infections persist over more than 1-2 years, the risk that they will result in precancer increases. The seriousness of a positive HPV-test, therefore, depends on whether it indicates a new infection or the persistence of a pre-existing one, and furthermore, determines a subsequent course of action. Screening guidelines prescribe clinical management based on the most recent test result and do not account for screening history, which often leads to over management of otherwise benign HPV infections.</p>
<p>The investigators conducted this study to assess the risk of cervical cancer or precancer associated with a positive HPV or abnormal cytology test after a screening history of consecutive negative co-tests. The study utilized data from Kaiser Permanente Northern California which included HPV screenings every 3 years, follow up, and treatment of over a million women over the age of 30 between 2003 and 2015.</p>
<p>Future research is needed to validate these findings in diverse populations. Additionally, since this study focused only on completely negative screening histories, future studies can address questions of complex screening histories.</p>

<p>A research team led by investigators from the National Institutes of Health and Global Good has developed a computer algorithm that can analyze digital images of a woman&rsquo;s cervix and accurately identify precancerous changes that require medical attention. This artificial intelligence (AI) approach, called automated visual evaluation, has the potential to revolutionize cervical cancer screening, particularly in low-resource settings.</p>
<p>To develop the method, researchers used comprehensive datasets to &ldquo;train&rdquo; a deep, or machine, learning algorithm to recognize patterns in complex visual inputs, such as medical images.

<p>A global resource that includes data on thousands of inherited variants in the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genes is available to the public. The BRCA Exchange was created through the BRCA Challenge, a long-term demonstration project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to enhance sharing of <em>BRCA1</em>/<em>BRCA2</em> data. The <a href="https://brcaexchange.org/">BRCA Exchange website</a> and new <a href="https://brcaexchange.org/about/app">BRCA Exchange Mobile App</a> allow clinicians to review expert classifications of variants in these major cancer predisposition genes as part of their individual assessment of complex questions related to cancer prevention, screening, and intervention for high-risk patients.</p>
<p>The five-year BRCA Challenge project was funded in part by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and through the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative">Cancer Moonshot</a>. A paper detailing the development of the BRCA Exchange was published January 8, 2019, by<em> PLOS Genetics</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project has yielded a meta-analysis of <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> variants collected from multiple sources to understand how experts annotate specific mutations in the two genes,&rdquo; said <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=31&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349630" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349630" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7201910" sys_variantid="1965" sys_contentid="349630">Stephen J.

<p>Researchers in the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, the National Institute on Drug Abuse, National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities, and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, conducted a formal analysis of overall death rates and death rates from drug poisoning among 25-64-year-olds in the United States to look for patterns by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, rurality and geography. The findings were published January 14, 2019, in the journal <em>Lancet Public Health</em>.</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2015, 9.5 million premature deaths occurred among 25-64-year-olds in the U.S., nearly 500,000 of them were from drug poisonings. In comparing the periods 2000-2003 and 2012-2015, the researchers observed sharp increases in rates of death from drug poisoning in counties throughout the country: wealthier and poorer counties, urban and rural counties, and among whites, blacks and Latinos. Although drug poisoning death rates increased more rapidly in poorer and rural counties, far more deaths occurred in metropolitan counties (76% of drug overdose deaths) than in rural counties (1% of drug overdose deaths), reflecting the larger population size of cities.</p>
<p>The authors conclude, drug overdose deaths are a national problem, increasing at an alarming rate in communities throughout the US, regardless of race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status or rurality. Future research should focus on strategies to prevent drug overdose deaths in different communities throughout the country.</p>

<p>This competitive award of nearly $450K over three years will support Dr. Trabert&rsquo;s investigations into the relationship of daily aspirin use over the life course and ovarian cancer risk using data from the Ovarian Cancer Cohort Consortium (OC3); identify subgroups of women who could most benefit from aspirin chemoprevention; and explore mechanisms by which aspirin reduces ovarian cancer risk by utilizing ovarian tumor tissue from OC3 cohorts. By leveraging and expanding upon the OC3, this investigation of aspirin use with ovarian cancer risk will address key questions needed to develop recommendations for aspirin-based chemoprevention.</p>

<p>Testicular Germ Cell Tumors (TGCT) are highly heritable, though despite extensive efforts no highly-penetrant cancer predisposition genes have been identified. In a new analysis, Checkpoint Kinase 2 (<em>CHEK2</em>) germline pathogenic variants were associated with a four-to-six times elevated risk of TGCT, with average age at presentation six years earlier than carriers of the wild-type alleles. The data were reported by investigators from DCEG, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, and the University of Pennsylvania, and published January 24, 2019, in the journal <em>JAMA Oncology</em>.</p>
<p>The authors describe the inherited variants in <em>CHEK2</em>, which were observed in 4% of cases in a multi-stage case-control study involving 884 male adults, as intermediate-risk drivers of TGCT susceptibility. <em>CHEK2</em> is a well-established modifier of risk for several other cancers, but it has never before been implicated in the development of familial TGCT. Mechanistically, these findings complement a growing body of evidence for <em>CHEK2</em> as a master regulator of chromosomal segregation, DNA damage repair and cell cycle regulation during germ cell development and maturation.</p>
<p>TGCT is the most common cancer diagnosed in young men. Understanding the genetic determinants of testicular cancer could help identify individuals at greatest risk who may benefit from genetic counseling and clinical care to improve early detection.</p>
