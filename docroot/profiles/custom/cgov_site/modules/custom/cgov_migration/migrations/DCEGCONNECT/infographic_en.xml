    <field_accessible_version>Know the Science: HR = Hormone receptor. HR+ means tumor cells have receptors for the hormones estrogen or progesterone, which can promote the growth of HR+ tumors. Hormone therapies like tamoxifen can be used to treat HR+ tumors. HER2 = Human epidermal growth Factor receptor, HER2+ means tumor cells overexpress (make high levels of) a protein, called HE2/neu, which has been shown to be associated with certain aggressive types of breast cancer. Trastuzumab and some other therapies can target cells that overexpress HER2. HR+/HER2, aka “LuminalA”. 73% of all breast cancer cases: best prognosis, most common subtype for every race, age, and poverty level. HR-/HER2, aka “Triple Negative”: 13% of all breast cancer cases, Worst prognosis, Non-Hispanic blacks have the highest rate of this subtype at every age and poverty level. HR+/HER2+, aka “Luminal B”, 10% of all breast cancer cases, little geographic variation by state. HR-/HER2+, aka”HER2-enriched”, 5% of all breast cancer cases, lowest rates for all races and ethnicities. www.cancer.gov Source: Special section of the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2011.</field_accessible_version>

<p>The NCTN structure includes five U.S. Network groups and the Canadian Collaborating Clinical Trials Network. Membership in the individual NCTN groups is based on criteria that are specific to each group. Sites can belong to more than one group, and membership in at least one group allows a site to participate in the trials led by any NCTN group for which their investigators are qualified. Consequently, researchers from the LAPS, NCORP, other academic centers, community practices, and international members associated with the Network groups may all enroll patients onto NCTN trials. Clinical trials led by NCTN groups may receive support from the IROC Group, ITSAs, and tissue banks, according to the scientific needs of the trials.</p>

<p>Clinical trial randomization is the process of assigning patients by chance to groups that receive different treatments. In the simplest trial design, the investigational group receives the new treatment and the control group receives standard therapy. At several points during and at the end of the clinical trial, researchers compare the groups to see which treatment is more effective or has fewer side effects.</p>
<p>Randomization helps prevent bias. Bias occurs when a trial's results are affected by human choices or other factors not related to the treatment being tested.</p>

    <field_accessible_version>Types of Cancer Research. Cancer research includes four broad categories. Basic research seeks to understand the fundamental aspects of nature. It provides the foundation for advances against cancer. Clinical research tests drugs, medical devices, or other interventions in human volunteers to improve all aspects of patient care. Population-based research explores the causes of cancer, cancer trends, and factors that affect the delivery and outcomes of cancer care in specific populations. Translational research moves basic research findings into the clinic and clinical research findings into everyday care. In turn, results from clinical and population-based studies can guide basic research.</field_accessible_version>

(1) A patient's T cells are removed from their blood. Then, (2) the gene for a special receptor called a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) is inserted into the T cells in the laboratory. The gene encodes the engineered CAR protein that is expressed on the surface of the patient's T cells, creating a CAR T cell. (3) Millions of CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory. (4) They are then given to the patient by intravenous infusion. (5) The CAR T cells bind to antigens on the cancer cells and kill them.</field_accessible_version>

<p><span>Information mapped in human tumor atlases will provide a comprehensive understanding of the ecosystem of tumors and show important transitions in cancer.</span></p>
</div>]]></body>
    <field_accessible_version>The construction of human tumor atlases will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the ecosystems of tumors at the macro- and the micro-level. NCI has established the Human Tumor Atlas Network (HTAN) for this purpose. 


apping the landscape of tumors will help identify biological markers of disease progression and treatment resistance and inform the development of precision risk-stratification, prevention, screening, diagnostic, and treatment strategies. To accomplish this, a better understanding of the molecular-, cellular-, and tissue-level communication networks that drive the major transitions in cancer from (1) normal cells to (2) dysplasia to (3) in situ carcinoma (noninvasive tumors) to (4) invasive disease and (5) metastasis is needed. This must be integrated with in-depth knowledge on how tumors (6) respond to treatment and (7) develop drug resistance. This information must be accompanied by a more complete understanding of the differences (heterogeneity) of cancer cells within tumors, the role of heterogeneity in tumor evolution, and the contributions of the noncancerous components of tumors in the microenvironment. The emergence of powerful new technologies and computational methods has put a comprehensive understanding of tumor ecosystems within our reach. Therefore, one recommendation of the Cancer MoonshotSM Blue Ribbon Panel was to develop 4-dimensional tumor atlases to document the molecular and cellular alterations and interactions within tumors as they evolve from precancerous lesions to advanced cancers.
To address this recommendation, NCI has established HTAN, which will focus initially on select adult and pediatric cancers. Each of the HTAN research centers will construct pilot-scale human tumor atlases describing important transitions in cancer: the transition from premalignant to malignant, the transition from locally invasive to metastatic disease, the dynamics of patient response to treatment, and the development of resistance to therapy. In addition, an HTAN Data Coordinating Center will collect, store, curate, and disseminate all data, tools, computational models, and completed atlases. Human tumor atlases will show the tissue, tumor, cell, and molecular level interactions of cancer.  Computer modeling and data integration of this multilevel information will allow for the creation of dynamic visual resources of tumor evolution. Tumor cells communicate with other cells, both locally and distantly. The organ- and tissue-level communication networks that support tumor development, growth, and metastasis can be mapped and integrated with analyses at multiple levels. Molecular networks are systems of interacting molecules (i.e., genes, proteins, etc.) that underlie specific biological functions. These intracellular networks can be mapped in all cells in the tumor microenvironment for integration into an atlas. Cancer development, progression, and metastasis require complex interactions within the local tumor microenvironment that are mediated by many factors. These interactions can be mapped spatially and temporally in a tumor atlas. Cancer cells have genetic and epigenetic alterations that influence the organization and expression of genes. These alterations and their effects on cancer cells can be mapped and integrated with other-level analyses in a tumor atlas.

    <field_accessible_version>Progress against cancer requires long-term investments in basic research, which lay the foundations for tomorrow's clinical advances. Research that leads to a new treatment or intervention usually involves a process that spans years or even decades before patients benefit. The development of the cancer drug crizotinib (Xalkori) is one such example. Crizotinib was initially developed to target the protein produced by the oncogene MET. It was later found to also inhibit the proteins produced by oncogenic forms of the ALK gene, which have been found in anaplastic large cell lymphomas (ALCL) and some non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) and neuroblastomas. NCI-funded basic research identified these targets and revealed their biological importance in cancer development and progression. The arc of scientific discovery leading to the first Food and Drug Administration approval of crizotinib for NSCLC spanned a period of nearly 30 years. Clinical testing of the drug for additional molecular subtypes of NSCLC, ALCL, and neuroblastoma continues today.</field_accessible_version>
