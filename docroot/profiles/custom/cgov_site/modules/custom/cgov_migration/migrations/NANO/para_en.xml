Nanotechnology-based structures and devices are already enabling a large number of novel applications in various fields &ndash; including medicine.</p>

<p>The earliest nanotechnology-enabled imaging agents and cancer drugs were approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) over a decade ago, and FDA approved nanomedicines include iron oxide nanoparticles for enhanced MRI imaging contrast and Abraxane&reg;, a nanoparticle formed by binding the serum protein albumin to the chemotherapy drug paclitaxel, and Doxil&reg;, a pegylated liposomal formulation of the chemotherapy drug docetaxel.&nbsp; Abraxane improves patient tolerance of the drug paclitaxel by stabilizing the drug for <em>in vivo</em> delivery without requiring the use of non-biocompatible chemical stabilizers. For some patients and cancers, Doxil improves the therapeutic efficacy of docetaxel and reduces cardiomyopathy, a dangerous side effect of the drug.</p>
<p>A number of nanomedicines and nanoparticle drugs have received Investigational New Drug (IND) approval from the FDA are currently undergoing clinical trials. Although some are intended to improve performance of existing chemotherapy drugs, as with Abraxane and Doxil, others enable use of potent compounds that are too toxic or insufficiently biocompatible for use without the pharmacokinetic advantages conferred by the nanoparticle packaging. Nanoparticles are also being investigated for delivery of nucleic acids and proteins that are unstable in blood, such as small interfering RNA (siRNA) for RNA interference (RNAi) therapy, and molecularly targeted therapies such as tyrosine kinase inhibitors.</p>
<h2>Treatment and Therapy&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Research on nanotechnology cancer therapy extends beyond drug delivery into the creation of new therapeutics available only through use of nanomaterial properties. Although small compared to cells, nanoparticles are large enough to encapsulate many small molecule compounds, which can be of multiple types. At the same time, the relatively large surface area of nanoparticle can be functionalized with ligands, including small molecules, DNA or RNA strands, peptides, aptamers or antibodies. These ligands can be used for therapeutic effect or to direct nanoparticle fate <em>in vivo</em>. These properties enable combination drug delivery, multi-modality treatment and combined therapeutic and diagnostic, known as &ldquo;theranostic,&rdquo; action. The physical properties of nanoparticles, such as energy absorption and re-radiation, can also be used to disrupt diseased tissue, as in laser ablation and hyperthermia applications.</p>
<p>Integrated development of innovative nanoparticle packages and active pharmaceutical ingredients will also enable exploration of a wider repertoire of active ingredients, no longer confined to those with acceptable pharmokinetic or biocompatibility behavior. In addition, immunogenic cargo and surface coatings are being investigated as both adjuvants to nanoparticle-mediated and traditional radio- and chemotherapy and as stand-alone therapies. Innovative strategies include the design of nanoparticles as artificial antigen presenting cells and <em>in vivo</em> depots of immunostimulatory factors that exploit nanostructured architecture for sustained anti-tumor activity.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Early Detection and Diagnosis</h2>
<p>Although not yet deployed clinically for cancer detection or diagnosis, nanoparticles are already on the market in numerous medical screens and tests, with the most widespread use that of gold nanoparticles in home pregnancy tests. Nanoparticles are also at the heart of the Verigene&reg; system from Nanosphere and the T2MR system from T2 Biosystems, currently used in hospitals for a variety of indications.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For cancer, nanodevices are being investigated for the capture of blood borne biomarkers, including cancer-associated proteins circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and tumor-shed exosomes. Nano-enabled sensors are capable of high sensitivity, specificity and multiplexed measurements. Next generation devices couple capture with genetic analysis to further elucidate a patient&rsquo;s cancer and potential treatments and disease course.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Already clinically established as contrast agents for anatomical structure, nanoparticles are being developed to act as molecular imaging agents, reporting on the presence of cancer-relevant genetic mutations or the functional characteristics of tumor cells. This information can be used to choose a treatment course or alter a therapeutic plan.&nbsp; Bioactivatable nanoparticles that change properties in response to factors or processes within the body act as dynamic reporters of <em>in vivo</em> states and can provide both spatial and temporal information on disease progression and therapeutic response.</p>
<h2>Research Tools</h2>
<p>Nanotechnology can also be used for development of research tools to advance the study of cancer. Examples include <em>in vitro </em>tumor models, such as vessel perfused microfluidic chips that mimic tumor microenvironment and enable study of transport properties within tumors and devices that use nanoparticle probes to study cellular drug responses and mechanisms.</p>

<p>Communicating new discoveries and sharing resources, including data and physical material generated as part of the NCI Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer, is of critical importance to realize the full potential of nanotechnology for the good of cancer patients. Regular communication and sharing of information needs to occur at three basic levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>Among institutions and investigators participating in the research activities within a given <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2317&amp;sys_contentid=1051493" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1051493" sys_dependentvariantid="2317" sys_relationshipid="6655269">Center of Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence (CCNEs)</a>;</li>
<li>Among the CCNEs and other programs that compose the Alliance; and</li>
<li>Among the greater research and development communities outside the Alliance.</li>
</ul>
<p>Research goals can only be reached by achieving advances at each level of collaboration and data sharing. Therefore, it is critical that a well-organized system of data sharing be established both within and outside the Alliance to achieve not only the free exchange of data and materials for research purposes, but also the translation of research into commercially viable therapeutics and diagnostics to treat patients.</p>
<p>To address the challenges of data sharing, NCI has participated in the development of nanomaterial data sharing resources and opportunities for the research community to discuss data sharing and define standards for nanotechnology.</p>

<p>The use of nanotechnology for diagnosis and treatment of cancer is largely still in the development phase. However, there are already several nanocarrier-based drugs on the market and many more nano-based therapeutics in clinical trials.&nbsp; The application of nanotechnology to medicine includes the use of precisely engineered materials to develop novel therapies and devices that may reduce toxicity as well as enhance the efficacy and delivery of treatments. As a result, the application of nanotechnology to cancer can lead to many advances in the prevention, detection, and treatment of cancer. The first nanotechnology-based cancer drugs have passed regulatory scrutiny and are already on the market including Doxil<sup>&reg;</sup> and Abraxane<sup>&reg;</sup>.</p>
<p>In recent years, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved numerous Investigational New Drug (IND) applications for nano-formulations, enabling clinical trials for breast, gynecological, solid tumor, lung, mesenchymal tissue, lymphoma, central nervous system and genito-urinary cancer treatments. The majority of these trials repurpose the previously approved technologies described above.</p>

<h2>Center Overview</h2>
<p>The Nanosystems Biology Cancer Center (NSBCC) is a partnership between the California Institute of Technology, the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC) at the University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), and the David Geffen School of Medicine. The NSBCC is led by the renowned scientists, James Heath of CalTech and Mike Phelps of UCLA.&nbsp; Both are supported by a team of co-investigators whom cross the projects from these institutions. The NSBCC was supported by the prior two rounds of CCNE funding, but it enters into this new funding period with a new set of faculty and a mission centered around trying to understand how best to administer combination therapies for cancer patients. The Center's cancer focus is on advanced brain cancers, as a model for a heterogeneous cancer that is effectively untreatable, and melanoma, as a model for understanding and expanding the power of immunotherapy. The NSBCC has four projects and two cores listed below.</p>

<h3>Project 2: Specifically Targeting Oncoproteins with PCC Agent-Loaded Nanoparticles</h3>
<p>Project Investigators: James Heath, Ph.D., Mark Davis, Ph.D., Raymond Deshaies, Ph.D., and Johannes Czernin, M.D.</p>
<p>In Project 2, NSBCC PI James Heath will collaborate with Mark Davis, Raymond Deshaies, Ph.D. and Johannes Czernin, M.D. to design molecular and nanotechnologies for targeting specific oncoproteins, with a particular focus on KRASG12D. In previous funding cycles, NSBCC resources were leveraged to help develop protein catalyzed capture agents (PCCs). PCCs can be targeted to bind to specific mutated sites on at least certain oncoproteins, with high selectivity relative to wildtype. This provides the opportunity for drug-targeting only diseased tissues. Here, PCCs will be combined with nanotherapeutics and novel proteolysis targeting chimeric antigen (PROTAC) methods developed by Raymond Deshaies to develop a new class of targeted cancer therapies.</p>

<h2>Center Overview</h2>
<p>Current cancer treatment methodologies fall short of providing efficacious, targeted, precision therapies geared towards the individual patient. Due to their novel chemical, biological, and physical properties, nucleic-acid based nanoconstructs can be used to gain access to privileged intracellular environments, discover new aspects of cancer biology, and exploit nanostructure-biomolecular interactions to create effective treatment options. The Northwestern CCNE will explore these vast possibilities by applying a novel class of nanostructure genetic constructs - the spherical nucleic acid (SNA) and variants of it - for the study and treatment of brain and prostate cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>SNAs enter cells in large quantities as single-entity agents and have been shown to cross the blood-brain-barrier (BBB) and the blood-tumor-barrier (BTB) in a systemic delivery scheme, and the epidermis in a topical approach. Once inside the cellular environment, SNAs resist enzymatic degradation, do not elicit toxicity or immunogenicity, and can be used to regulate gene expression via antisense and RNAi pathways. SNAs form the foundation of the technological focus of the Northwestern CCNE which, once successful, will generate a large body of fundamental knowledge that will stand to unravel a portion of the complex landscape of cancer genetics and biology, and deliver two first-in-class SNA nanostructure-based agents - a therapeutic for precision neuro-oncology that can be used to treat glioblastoma multiforme and a therapeutic cancer vaccine that can be used to treat prostate cancer.</p>
<p>The Northwestern CCNE is led by International Institute for Nanotechnology Director, Chad A. Mirkin, PhD, and Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center Director, Leonidas Platanias, MD. Dr. Mirkin and Dr. Platanias bring extensive knowledge, skill, and experience to the enterprise, and together, share the authority and responsibility for leading and directing the project.</p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<h3>Project 1: Design Rules for SNAs that Target Cancer</h3>
<p>Project Investigator: Milan Mrksich, Ph.D.</p>
<p>Led by Professor of Chemistry Milan Mrksich, this project will develop the design rules for the synthesis of SNAs with maximum / optimal gene regulatory or immunostimulatory capacity. Major goals include the analysis of the bulk responses from thousands of cells and the use of NanoFlare technology and microfluidic systems to probe and analyze the individual responses of single cells. The data from these measurements will be used to develop structure-activity rules that guide the optimization of nanoparticle therapeutics for Projects 2 and 3. The work will identify those structural features that promote (as well as detract from) the wanted pharmacological effects.</p>

<h3>Project 2: SNAs for Metabolic Reprogramming of Malignant Glioma</h3>
<p>Project Investigator: Alexander Stegh, Ph.D.</p>
<p>Project 2 is led by Alexander Stegh, an Assistant Professor and Zell Scholar in the Department of Neurology. The project will preferentially inhibit, in GBM cells, one of the most fundamentally important energy generating pathways, the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and, in so doing, trigger tumor cell killing induced by inhibitors of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKi). Major goals of this project include functionally evaluating a library of IDH1-targeting SNAs to identify high-activity constructs, evaluating siIDH1-SNAs as adjuvant for RTKi in GBM subtype-defined PDX models, and determining anti-glioma effects of siIDH1-SNAs and RTKIs in a genetically engineered mouse (GEM) model for GBM. This project will comprehensively characterize IDH1 as a novel therapeutic target in GBM, and provide preclinical proof-of-concept that the systemic transfer of siRNAs targeted to IDH1 as adjuvant for RTKi is an effective new strategy to combat malignant brain cancers.</p>

<h3>Project 3: SNAs as Immunotherapeutic Agents for Prostate Cancer</h3>
<p>Project Investigator: Chad A. Mirkin, Ph.D.</p>
<p>This is a translational project led by Center PI Chad Mirkin. This project will develop a new class of therapeutic vaccines based on SNAs for the treatment of prostate cancer. SNAs represent a therapeutic platform for the rational design of nanostructures that induce potent immunostimulatory responses directed towards prostate tumor antigens. Major goals of this project include the design and synthesis of immunostimulatory SNAs (IS-SNA) for lymphocyte activation, analysis of the immunostimulatory activity of IS-SNAs with a panel of standardized <em>in vitro</em> assays, assessment and characterization of IS-SNA activity in immunocompetent mouse models, and development of combination therapies for an optimized cancer immunotherapy: immunostimulation by IS-SNAs combined with modulation of the immunosuppression of solid tumors. The IS-SNA platform is expected to show excellent immunostimulatory properties in the treatment of prostate cancer. Furthermore, the combinations of IS-SNAs and tumor microenvironment modulators are expected to show synergy, and lead to improved therapeutic outcomes over those of either agent alone. These results will inform the design of early stage clinical studies that involve the combination of these agents to be conducted by the commercialization partner.</p>

<h2>Center Overview</h2>
<p>The scientific theme of the MC2TCN is based on advancing and translating a suite of ultrasmall (&lt;10 nm) fluorescent silica organic hybrid nanoparticles, referred to as Cornell dots (or C dots), with tunable size, brightness, and geometry that may dramatically impact the way we diagnose and treat tumors on the basis of their favorable physicochemical, imaging, and biological properties. Earlier generation cancer-targeted C dots for both PET and optical imaging received FDA investigational new drug (IND) approvals for first-in-human clinical trials. Informed by these successes, MC2TCN will develop real-time intraoperative near infra-red (NIR) fluorescence detection tools to improve localization, staging, and treatment of melanoma, in addition to therapeutic delivery vehicles for enhancing targeted particle uptake, penetration, and efficacy in malignant brain tumors. The Center addresses common problems in oncology related to a lack of exquisitely bright, cancer-specific intraoperative visualization tools for targeted treatment of poorly prognostic nodal metastases, as well as the need for better targeted therapeutic delivery vehicles that may overcome the unfavorable biological properties, dose-limiting toxicity, and modest efficacy associated with native small molecule inhibitors (SMIs). The Center will (1) create new &lt;10 nm probes with finely-tuned properties for reliably and accurately detecting cancer and/or normal tissue targets in surgical settings; (2) engineer &lt;10 nm delivery vehicles incorporating SMIs or radiotherapies that can individually, or in combination with immunotherapies, selectively and efficaciously treat cancer, and (3) identify and qualify potential staging, prognostic and/or predictive biomarkers of response that can be validated by future clinical trial designs.</p>

<p>The CCNE-TD will develop and clinically translate cancer diagnostics and imaging technologies in two scientific thematic focus areas: i) predicting and monitoring cancer therapy response in lung cancer and ii) merging nano-based <em>in vitro</em> and <em>in vivo</em> diagnostics strategies and nano-based imaging for earlier cancer detection and prognostication of prostate cancer. CCNE-TD investigators will utilize nanotechnology to measure changes in cancer patterns via 1) imaging though cancer-triggered-self-assembling as well as dis-assembling nanoparticles (Projects 1 and 3) and 2) in serum using magneto-nano sensors (Project 2). Center nanotechnologies will be used to interrogate single cells for DNA, RNA, proteins, cellular micro/nano vesicles, to evaluate biomarker potentials of those (Projects 2 and 3), and will again utilize nanotechnology (e.g., self-assembling nanoparticles and nanobubbles) to image cell associated proteins in small animal models, as well as humans, and clinically translate them for human prostate cancer imaging with ultrasound / photoacoustics (Project 3). In all of these cases, changes at the molecular level are being measured within the cell, on the cell membrane, and in the extracellular matrix. We believe that measuring these changes is critical to the problem of earlier cancer detection and monitoring response to therapies with both the <em>ex vivo</em> diagnostic nanosensor technologies and the <em>in vivo</em> imaging technologies.</p>
<p>The Center has two major technological arms: i) <em>in vitro</em> genomic/proteomic/cellomic nanosensors, and ii) <em>in vivo</em> molecular imaging with primarily gold as well as nanobubble-based nanoparticles, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with novel self-assembling and disassembling nanoparticles. The latter arm is directly focused on molecular imaging with specific cellular protein targets. These targets are the basis whereby specific molecular imaging signal is provided. It is the goal of the CCNE-TD to help identify these targets for specific cancers (lung and prostate) and their biochemical pathways and to utilize these targets as ways to home in on cancer cells. In addition, our new class of nanoparticles that can self-assemble intracellularly, from the cell permeable precursors, in a cancer specific manner, in conjunction with our advanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) expertise, is expected to directly impact the development of medical imaging modalities for eventual clinical translation. With our highly interactive and cohesive program focused on developing and validating nanotechnology for anti-cancer therapy response, earlier cancer detection and prognostication, we will imagine, invent, and innovate for the benefit of cancer patients.</p>

<h2>Center Overview</h2>
<p>Host response targeting of both immune and stromal components represents an enormous opportunity to overcome cancer through the body's built in defense mechanisms. The focus of the UNC-Chapel Hill CCNE is to exploit the host response through nano approaches for cancer disease management and treatment. The research team is led by Principal Investigators Leaf Huang, Ph.D. and Joel Tepper, M.D. Leaf Huang is a pioneer in liposome research and non-viral gene therapy. He was the first</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
<li>to publish grafting polyethylene glycol to liposomes to enhance the circulation time; and</li>
<li>to develop a low toxicity cationic lipid for gene transfection.</li>
</ol>
<p>Joel Tepper, M.D. is an accomplished leader and clinical and translational investigator who has contributed at both the local and national level to translational research and was co-PI of the previous UNC CCNE. The Center proposes developing targeted methods for the delivery of biologics and immunologic modifiers and chemotherapies against melanoma and non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), utilizing innovative nanotechnologies developed at UNC. There are four projects in the CCNE. The projects revolve around the central theme of exploiting the host response against tumors with an emphasis on the immune response. Center projects emphasize the treatment of malignant melanoma, an aggressive tumor with a strong immunological component, and NSCLC, a tumor that when advanced is not well treated by most therapeutic modalities.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Center Overview</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-laboratories/optical-radiology-laboratory-orl/center-for-multiple-myeloma-nanotherapy-cmmn">The Washington University Center for Multiple Myeloma Nanotherapy (WU CMMN)</a> will address overarching questions in bone malignancies, with a focus on multiple myeloma (MM). MM is a hematopoietic disease caused by terminally differentiated malignant plasma B-cells. Despite tremendous improvements in MM patient management, nearly all patients will eventually relapse and die from it. Leveraging the enormous institutional resources and support, diverse expertise in MM, the integral participation of patient advocates and industry partners, and synergistic integration of basic and clinical investigators, the WU CMMN will serve as a comprehensive center for the development of nanotechnology-based solutions for treating MM and bone metastasis. Anchored by three projects and two cores, we aim to improve MM treatment outcomes with minimal off-target toxicity by developing novel nanotherapeutics that combine unique drug delivery mechanisms with spatiotemporal treatment paradigms.</p>
<p>Samuel Achilefu and Gregory Lanza are the PIs/PDs of the Center. Dr. Achilefu is a pioneer in the development of molecular imaging probes and nanomaterials for imaging and treatment of cancer. He currently leads the translation of innovative imaging technologies and molecular probes from bench to bedside. Dr. Lanza is a distinguished leader in the development and translation of nanomaterials to the clinic. He has extensive experience in the practice of medicine, nanomedicine research and development, and pharmaceutical development in large industry as well as small biotechnology start-ups. Three synergistic and highly interactive interdisciplinary research projects will anchor the center. Each project is led by senior investigators with expertise in basic and translational research.</p>

<p>Project 1: Small molecule cMYC-inhibitors are incorporated as lipase labile prodrugs in VLA-4-directed Micelles (&lt;20nm).&nbsp; 1) Micelles home beyond the vasculature, penetrate into the extravascular space and bind the alpha 4 beta 1 (VLA-4) cell surface receptor over expressed by multiple myeloma (MM). 2) The micelle forms a hemifusion complex with the MM outer cell membrane and lipid-complexed cMYC prodrug passes into the target cell. 3) The cMYC-prodrug (cMYC-PD) flips from the outer to inner cell membrane, which is contiguous with all of the intracellular membranes of the cell except the mitochondria. 4. Intracellular lipases liberate the cMYC active drug from the inactive lipid prodrug complex, which becomes available to interact with cMYC transcription factor (TF) in the cytosol (4b).&nbsp; 4a Uncomplexed cMYC TF can penetrate into the nucleus, complex with MAX transcription factor to form a heterodimer that interacts with the E-box of DNA to stimulate cell proliferation (5a). cMYC inhibited by the free Myc-inhibitor in the cytosol can enter the nucleus but cannot complex with MAX. This disrupts MM cell proliferation and promotes MM apoptosis.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The invasive forms of brain tumors, such as glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) are characteristically diffused with infiltrating edges, resistant to drugs and nearly inaccessible to systemic therapies due to the brain-tumor barrier. To address the challenges of drug delivery and resistance, our objective is to integrate the unique features of a chain-like nanoparticle with the appropriate combination of complementary drugs to enable effective treatment of invasive brain tumors. These nanochains are comprised of iron oxide nanospheres and a drug-loaded liposome chemically linked into a chain-like assembly with high precision. The nanochain possesses a unique ability to scavenge the tumor endothelium. By utilizing effective vascular targeting of the &alpha;<sub>&nu;</sub>&beta;<sub>3</sub> integrin receptor, the nanochains achieve rapid deposition on the vascular bed of glioma sites establishing well-distributed drug reservoirs on the endothelium of brain tumors. After reaching the target sites, an on-command, external low-power radiofrequency field can remotely trigger rapid drug release, due to mechanical disruption of the liposome, facilitating widespread and effective drug delivery across the brain-tumor barrier into regions harboring brain tumor cells.</p>
<p>To address the drug resistance issue, we have identified glioma stem cell (GSC)-specific regulators amenable to pharmacologic targeting. We recently showed that the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) is a unique signal regulator in GSCs. Due to the flexibility of loading various types of drugs within the nanochain, the nanochain will be loaded with standard chemotherapy and an iNOS inhibitor that eliminates the small fraction of GBM cells that are resistant, and can migrate to cause tumor recurrence. Due to enhanced site-specific targeting and rapid drug release, we hypothesize that guaranteeing the simultaneous delivery of drugs with synergistic activity into hard-to-reach glioma sites will facilitate effective treatment and ultimately eradication of the disease using a safe dose of the drugs.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) is the sixth most common cancer worldwide. The clinically used combination, radiation and chemotherapy, is the most common curative treatment for HNSCC, but causes many undesirable side effects and will incur a progressive resistance. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an effective anticancer procedure although its clinical application is limited due to extreme light sensitivity of patients before/after treatment, a suboptimal reactive oxygen species generation efficiency, and shallow tissue penetration (&lt; 1 cm) due to the frequency of light required. On the other hand, nanoparticle-based photosensitizers (PSs) can selectively accumulate in tumors alleviating the light sensitivity issue and more. Near-IR triggered PDT and X-ray induced PDT (X-PDT) have the ability to combine the strength of improved tissue penetration depth of the near-IR and X-ray modalities with the clinical advantages of PDT for deep tumor treatment. We are developing an entirely new class of nanoparticle PSs based on nanoscale metal-organic frameworks (NMOFs) that have the ideal characteristics of tunable chemical compositions, crystalline structures, extremely high porosity, short-term stability, and long-term biodegradability to enable NIR triggered PDT for superficial tumors and X-PDT for deep tumors. This project addresses the unmet needs in developing highly efficient and safe nanoparticle PSs that can have much broader clinical applications for cancer by NIR-triggered PDT or X-PDT.</p>

<p>Specifically, in aim 1 we will optimize NMOF structures, particle sizes, and surface characteristics to achieve NIR-triggered PDT and X-PDT with improved efficiency. Efforts will also be made for scaled-up NMOF synthesis and surface functionalization to achieve long blood circulation times. In aim 2, the NIR-PDT efficacy of NMOFs will be evaluated against multiple HNSCC cell lines <em>in vitro</em>. We will investigate the <em>in vivo</em> toxicity and efficacy of one most potent NMOF identified at cellular level against HNSCC subcutaneous xenograft and orthotopic mouse models. Finally, in aim 3 the X-PDT efficacy of NMOFs will be investigated against HNSCC cells <em>in vitro</em>. For the <em>in vivo</em> studies, we will first evaluate the toxicity of the NMOFs and the X-PDT treatment alone. The <em>in vivo</em> anticancer efficacy will be carried out on both subcutaneous and orthotopic HNSCC mouse models with the two most potent NMOFs identified at the cellular level. We will also apply state-of-the-art small-animal image-guided X-Ray delivery technology to enable image-guided X-PDT, toward translation in clinical radiotherapy.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a dual targeted and stroma breaking theranostic nanoparticle platform to address an unmet, clinical challenge of poor drug delivery efficiency in the application of nanomedicine to cancer therapy. Many types of human cancers, particularly pancreatic cancer, present a dense fibrotic tumor stroma that creates physical barriers against conventional drug delivery approaches. Building upon our understanding of pancreatic cancer biology and expertise in developing theranostic nanoparticles, we are developing a stroma breaking drug delivery system using a new generation of 3-nm ultra-fine magnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (uIONP) coated with an anti-fouling 'stealth' polymer for enhanced tumor penetration and retention, high capacity drug loading, and T<sub>1</sub>/T<sub>2</sub>-switchable MRI contrasts for imaging drug delivery. A dual targeting strategy coupling ligands targeting urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR) and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF1R) onto a single nanoparticle is used to maximize both tumor stromal and pancreatic cancer cell targeting, and drug delivery. Additionally, the use of a recombinant MMP14 protease active uPAR targeting ligand should break the extracellular matrix barrier. uIONPs will carry cisplatin and / or SN38, a potent camptothecin analogue, for effective treatment of drug resistant pancreatic cancer cells.</p>
<p>The combination of these unique properties should enable the theranostic uIONPs to break tumor stromal barriers and disrupt the tumor microenvironment leading to improved cancer molecular targeting and drug delivery in treating pancreatic cancer. The efficiency of targeted delivery and intratumoral distribution of the uIONP and therapeutic efficacy will be investigated in orthotopic human pancreatic cancer patient tissue-derived xenograft (PDX) and transgenic mouse pancreatic tumor models using MR and optical imaging, multiphoton microscopy, and histological and chemical analyses. This new generation of theranostic IONPs and our strategy to overcome drug delivery barriers will change the paradigm of future development and translation of image-guided and targeted therapies for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer as well as cancer nanotechnology in general.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The overarching premise of our project is to use the mouse eye as a non-surgical window for highly efficient, optical investigation of all aspects of syngeneic or xenograft models, using a state-of-the-art ocular imaging facility, the "EyePod." The EyePod employs single-cell resolution intravital confocal microscopy and optical coherence tomography, performed completely non-invasively through the natural optics of the eye. This technology enables repeatable <em>in vivo</em> imaging over weeks and even months, quantitative tracking of tumor development and delivery of theranostic nanoparticles, and the measurement of tumor and tissue responses. Moreover, the retina is a highly "approachable part of the brain", so that non-invasive study of ocular tumors provides a platform for examining such critical issues as drug delivery across the blood brain barrier (BBB) and neurotoxicity. We will employ our recently reported nanoporphyrin in this research.</p>

<p>This novel multifunctional porphyrin-based micellar nanoplatform allows:</p>
<ul>
<li>efficient encapsulation of hydrophobic chemotherapeutic drugs or fluorescent dyes,</li>
<li>near-infra red fluorescent (NIRF) detection of the tumor via the intrinsic fluorescence of porphyrins,</li>
<li>photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) via efficient free radical and heat generation at the tumor site, respectively,</li>
<li>(Gd(III) loading for MRI imaging,</li>
<li><sup>64</sup>Cu loading for PET imaging, and</li>
<li>convenient ligation of cancer-targeting ligands to the surface of the micelle for cancer-specific targeted delivery.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thorough understanding of how this nanocarrier distributes within the tumor microenvironment, and how it responds to controlled optical stimulation will enable us to maximize its therapeutic potential as a nano-theranostic agent. We will also study the effect of active targeting of nanocarriers with tumor and brain endothelial cell targeting peptides.</p>
<p>In more detail, our specific aims include;</p>
<ul>
<li>To develop intraocular glioblastoma and breast cancer xenograft models in eyes of nude mice, and to use non-invasive optical techniques (e.g., EyePod) to study the development of these tumor models at cellular resolution longitudinally over days and weeks, and their response to treatment with nanodoxorubicin;</li>
<li>To use the tumor models and EyePod to study the biodistribution and photo-response of tumor targeting and non-targeting nanoporphyrins within the tumor micro-environment <em>in vivo</em>, and to use cryo-electron microscopy to "dissect" the nanodelivery at the ultrastructural level; and</li>
<li>To optimize brain vascular endothelial cell-penetrating ligands, and to use <em>in vivo</em> EyePod imaging and cryoelectron microscopy to study their nanodelivery into retinal vasculature, and across the blood retinal barrier, which is very similar to blood brain barrier.</li>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The long-term objective of this IRCN award is to develop Thermoresponsive (TR)-NanoVelcro circulating tumor cell (CTC) purification system that can be digitally programmed to achieve optimal performance for recovering viable CTCs in prostate cancer (PC) patients' blood, allowing seamless coupling with various downstream molecular assays. The unique mechanism of our devices is that by switching device temperature in a physiologically endurable range (i.e., 4-37 &deg;C), thermoresponsive conformational changes of nanosubstrate-grafted polymer brushes alter the accessibility of capture agent to specifically capture (37 &deg;C) and release (4 &deg;C) CTCs to give viable CTCs in desired purity. Our central hypothesis is that through rational optimization and systematic validation, viable CTCs can be purified for <em>ex vivo</em> expansion, and molecular characterization of freshly isolated and <em>ex vivo</em> expanded CTCs can help better investigate and monitor PC evolution from androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) sensitive states to castration resistant PC (CRPC).</p>
<p>Our major goals are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop, optimize and validate TR-NanoVelcro CTC purification system,</li>
<li>demonstrate improved <em>ex vivo</em> expansion of purified CTCs with minimum "expansion bias", and</li>
<li>establish key genomic and transcriptomic events in PC using both <em>ex vivo</em> expanded and freshly purified CTCs and quantify the potential perturbations introduced by TR-NanoVelcro purification system.</li>
</ul>
<p>This nanomaterial-embedded cancer diagnostic platform is expected to introduce a unique rare-cell sorting method that enables detection, isolation, and characterization of CTCs in peripheral blood, providing an opportunity to noninvasively monitor the disease progression in individual PC patients. Ultimately, we will broaden the future clinical applications to other types of cancer, and channel TR-NanoVelcro CTC purification system into translational and regulatory pipelines.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>Nanocarriers that circumvent the stromal barrier in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) to allow:</p>
<ul>
<li>ratiometric control of a synergistic gemcitabine (GEM)/paclitaxel (PTX) combination,</li>
<li>overcome rate limiting steps in GEM metabolism, and</li>
<li>reduce FOLFIRINOX toxicity (a potent 4-drug regimen that includes irinotecan) could significantly impact PDAC survival.</li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of our multidisciplinary approach is to use rationally designed mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNP) to provide efficacious, safe and life-prolonging chemotherapy to PDAC patients. Our objectives are to develop and implement MSNP nanocarriers of which:</p>
<ul>
<li>achieve stable and high dose GEM and irinotecan loading, using a supported lipid bilayer (LB);</li>
<li>provide synergistic PTX/GEM co-delivery, with efficacy testing in human-derived PDAC tumors and a KPC-derived model;</li>
<li>provide high dose encapsulated irinotecan delivery to reduce toxicity;</li>
<li>achieve carrier targeting or transcytosis by iRGD peptide, which may also prevent metastasis;</li>

<p>Specifically, aim 1 will use LB-coated MSNP to optimize GEM delivery and efficacy in human derived PDAC tumors and a KPC-derived model. Aim 2 will demonstrate how the biocompatibility of LB-MSNP can be used to improve the toxicity profile and efficacy of irinotecan delivery in PDAC. Aim 3 will demonstrate that targeted delivery of iRGD-MSNP, promotion of nanocarrier transcytosis by iRGD co-delivery, or improvement of vascular access by TGF-&beta;i can enhance the chemotherapeutic efficacy of MSNP nanocarriers. We expect the co-delivery of GEM / PTX and irinotecan by multifunctional MSNPs will improve survival and reduce toxicity in robust animal models. Positive impact will include the efficacious and safe nanocarriers that can be placed into the pipeline of novel diagnostics and therapeutics being tested in human PDAC. This research will also increase fundamental understanding of the PDAC microenvironment and PDAC-specific stromal barrier.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to improve systemic therapies of cancer using soft nanomaterials that can penetrate deep into tumors and deliver potent anticancer agents to targeted cancer cells. We have developed a novel platform for drug delivery that uses aqueous polymeric gel nanoparticles termed core-shell nanogels (CSNGs). CSNGs are manufactured through a proprietary self-assembly process and can be readily filled with various drug payloads. They are water-swollen and are practically non-adhesive, which may diminish their off-target side effects. We hypothesize that</p>
<ul>
<li>the systemic and tumor flow dynamics of CSNGs will be a function of their molecular architecture and mechanical properties and</li>
<li>that these properties can be rationally controlled to modify the PK, distribution and tumor penetration of the CSNGs and the drugs they deliver.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will focus our research efforts on using CSNGs for triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), a disease that, despite treatment advances, still has a very poor outcome. As disease-targeting strategies, we will use the novel single-domain polypeptide antagonists of the EGFR and HER3 that are frequently overexpressed in TNBC and are associated with a higher risk of mortality in TNBC.</p>
<p>The specific aims of our work involve:</p>
<ul>
<li>Determine how the molecular architecture and mechanical properties of polypeptide-based CSNGs affects their ability to load, deliver and release therapeutic cargos;</li>
<li>Determine how the structure and mechanical properties of the drug-loaded CSNGs affect the <em>in vivo</em> PK and tumor distribution of the drugs and nanogels in murine models of TNBC;</li>
<li>Develop EGFR and HER3 targeted drug-loaded CSNGs with maximal tumor penetration, maximal delivery of drug payload to tumors and potent anti-tumor activity in TNBC.</li>
</ul>
<p>These integrative efforts will address major barriers in developing nanotechnology platforms for the treatment of TNBC, and facilitate understanding of the cancer biology and the mechanisms of <em>in vivo</em> delivery.</p>

<p>Nanotechnology is a powerful tool for combating cancer and is being put to use in other applications that may reduce pollution, energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and help prevent diseases. NCI&rsquo;s <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2317&amp;sys_contentid=1051623" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1051623" sys_dependentvariantid="2317" sys_relationshipid="6654334">Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer</a> is working to ensure that nanotechnologies for cancer applications are developed responsibly.</p>
<p>There is nothing inherently dangerous about being nanosized. Our ability to manipulate objects at the nanoscale has developed relatively recently, but nanoparticles are as old as the earth. Many nanoparticles occur naturally (for example, in volcanic ash and sea spray) and as by-products of human activities since the Stone Age (nanoparticles are in smoke and soot from fire). There are so many ambient incidental nanoparticles, in fact, that one of the challenges of nanoparticle exposure studies is that background incidental nanoparticles are often at order-of-magnitude higher levels than the engineered particles being evaluated.</p>
<p>As with any new technology, the safety of nanotechnology is continuously being tested. The small size, high reactivity, and unique tensile and magnetic properties of nanomaterials&mdash;the same properties that drive interest in their biomedical and industrial applications&mdash;have raised concerns about implications for the environment, health, and safety (EHS). There has been some as yet unresolved debate recently about the potential toxicity of a specific type of nanomaterial&mdash;carbon nanotubes (CNTs)&mdash;which has been associated with tissue damage in animal studies. However, the majority of available data indicate that there is nothing uniquely toxic about nanoparticles as a class of materials.</p>
<p>In fact, most engineered nanoparticles are far less toxic than household cleaning products, insecticides used on family pets, and over-the-counter dandruff remedies. Certainly, the nanoparticles used as drug carriers for chemotherapeutics are much less toxic than the drugs they carry and are designed to carry drugs safely to tumors without harming organs and healthy tissue.</p>
<p>To insure that potential risks of nanotechnology are thoroughly evaluated, the NCI Alliance for Nanotechnology in Cancer makes the services of its <a href="https://ncl.cancer.gov/">Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory (NCL)</a> available to the nanotech and cancer research communities. The NCL, an intramural program of the Alliance, performs nanomaterial safety and toxicity testing <em>in vitro</em> (in the laboratory) and using animal models. The NCL tests are designed to characterize nanomaterials that enter the bloodstream, regardless of route. This testing is just one part of the NCL's cascade of tests to evaluate the physicochemical properties, biocompatibility, and efficacy of nanomaterials intended for cancer therapy and diagnosis. To date, the NCL has evaluated more than 125 different nanoparticles intended for medical applications.</p>
<p>The NCL works closely with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) to devise experiments that are relevant to nanomaterials, to validate these tests on a variety of nanomaterial types, and to disseminate its methods to the nanotech and cancer research communities. The NCL also facilitates the development of voluntary-consensus standards for reliably and pro-actively measuring and monitoring environment, health and safety ramifications of nanotech applications.</p>
<p>Whether actual or perceived, the potential health risks associated with the manufacture and use of nanomaterials must be carefully studied in order to advance our understanding of this field of science and to realize the significant benefits that nanotechnology has to offer society, such as for cancer research, diagnostics, and therapy.</p>

<p>Nanoscale devices are one hundred to ten thousand times smaller than human cells. They are similar in size to large biological molecules ("biomolecules") such as enzymes and receptors. As an example, hemoglobin, the molecule that carries oxygen in red blood cells, is approximately 5 nanometers in diameter. Nanoscale devices smaller than 50 nanometers can easily enter most cells, while those smaller than 20 nanometers can move out of blood vessels as they circulate through the body. Because of their small size, nanoscale devices can readily interact with biomolecules on both the surface and inside cells. By gaining access to so many areas of the body, they have the potential to detect disease and deliver treatment in ways unimagined before now.</p>
<p>Biological processes, including ones necessary for life and those that lead to cancer, occur at the nanoscale. Thus, in fact, we are composed of a multitude of biological nano-machines. Nanotechnology provides researchers with the opportunity to study and manipulate macromolecules in real time and during the earliest stages of cancer progression. Nanotechnology can provide rapid and sensitive detection of cancer-related molecules, enabling scientists to detect molecular changes even when they occur only in a small percentage of cells. Nanotechnology also has the potential to generate entirely novel and highly effective therapeutic agents.</p>
<p>Ultimately and uniquely, the use of nanoscale materials for cancer, comes down to its ability to be readily functionalized and easily tuned; its ability to deliver and / or act as the therapeutic, diagnostic, or both; and its ability to passively accumulate at the tumor site, to be actively targeted to cancer cells, and to be delivered across traditional biological barriers in the body such as dense stromal tissue of the pancreas or the blood-brain barrier that highly regulates delivery of biomolecules to / from, our central nervous system.</p>
<h2>Passive Tumor Accumulation</h2>
<p>An effective cancer drug delivery should achieve high accumulation in tumor and spare the surrounding healthy tissues. The passive localization of many drugs and drug carriers due to their extravasation through leaky vasculature (named the Enhanced Permeability and Retention [EPR] effect) works very well for tumors. As tumor mass grows rapidly, a network of blood vessels needs to expand quickly to accommodate tumor cells&rsquo; need for oxygen and nutrient. This abnormal and poorly regulated vessel generation (i.e. angiogenesis) results in vessel walls with large pores (40 nm to 1 um); these leaky vessels allow relatively large nanoparticles to extravasate into tumor masses. As fast growing tumor mass lacks a functioning lymphatic system, clearance of these nanoparticles is limited and further enhances the accumulation. Through the EPR effect, nanoparticles larger than 8 nm (between 8-100 nm) can passively target tumors by freely pass through large pores and achieve higher intratumoral accumulation. The majority of current nanomedicines for solid tumor treatment rely on EPR effect to ensure high drug accumulation thereby improve treatment efficacy. Without targeting cell types expressing targeting ligand of interest, this drug delivery system is called passive targeting.</p>

<p>Before reaching to the proximity of tumor site for EPR effect to take place, passive targeting requires drug delivery system to be long-circulating to allow sufficient level of drug to the target area. To design nano-drugs that can stay in blood longer, one can &ldquo;mask&rdquo; these nano-drugs by modifying the surface with water-soluble polymers such as polyethylene glycol (PEG); PEG is often used to make water-insoluble nanoparticles to be water-soluble in many pre-clinical research laboratories. PEG-coated liposomal doxorubicin (Doxil) is used clinically for breast cancer leveraging passive tumor accumulation. As in vivo surveillance system for macromolecules (i.e., scavenger receptors of the reticuloendothelial system, RES) reportedly showed faster uptake of negatively charged nanoparticles, nano-drugs with a neutral or positive charge are expected to have a longer plasma half-life.</p>
<p>Utilizing EPR effect for passive tumor targeting drug delivery is not without problems. Although EPR effect is a unique phenomenon in solid tumors, the central region of metastatic or larger tumor mass does not exhibit EPR effect, a result of an extreme hypoxic condition. For this reason, there are methods used in the clinics to artificially enhance EPR effect: slow infusion of angiotensin II to increase systolic blood pressure, topical application of NO-releasing agents to expand blood and photodynamic therapy or hyperthermia-mediated vascular permeabilization in solid tumors.</p>
<p>Passive accumulation through EPR effect is the most acceptable drug delivery system for solid tumor treatment. However, size or molecular weight of the nanoparticles is not the sole determinant of the EPR effect, other factors such as surface charge, biocompatibility and in vivo surveillance system for macromolecules should not be ignored in designing the nanomedicine for efficient passive tumor accumulation.</p>
<h2>Active Tumor Targeting</h2>
<p>EPR effect, which serves as nanoparticle &lsquo;passive tumor targeting&rsquo; scheme is responsible for accumulation of particles in the tumor region. However, EPR does not promote uptake of nanoparticles into cells; yet nanoparticle/drug cell internalization is required for some of the treatment modalities relying on drug activation within the cell nucleus or cytosol (1). Similarly, delivery of nucleic acids (DNA, siRNA, miRNA) in genetic therapies requires escape of these molecules from endosome so they can reach desired subcellular compartments. In addition, EPR is heterogenous and its strength vary among different tumors and/or patients. For these reasons, active targeting is considered an essential feature for next generation nanoparticle therapeutics. It will enable certain modalities of therapies not achievable with EPR and improve effectiveness of treatments which can be accomplished using EPR, but with less than satisfactory effect. Active targeting of nanoparticles to tumor cells, microenvironment or vasculature, as well as directed delivery to intracellular compartments, can be attained through nanoparticle surface modification with small molecules, antibodies, affibodies, peptides or aptamers.</p>

<p>Passive targeting (EPR effect) is is the process of nanoparticles extravasating from the circulation through the leaky vasculature to the tumor region. The drug molecules carried by nanoparticle are released in the extracellular matrix and diffuse throughout the tumor tissue. The particles carry surface ligands to facilitate active targeting of particles to receptors present on target cell or tissue. Active targeting is expected to enhance nanoparticle/drug accumulation in tumor and also promote their prospective cell uptake through receptor mediated endocytosis.&nbsp; The particles, which are engineered for vascular targeting, incorporate ligands that bind to endothelial cell-surface receptors. The vascular targeting is expected to provide synergistic strategy utilizing both targeting of vascular tissue and cells within the diseased tissue.</p>
<p>Most of the nanotechnology-based strategies which are approved for clinical use or are in advanced clinical trials rely on EPR effect. It is expected that next generation nanotherapies will use targeting to enable and enhance intracellular uptake, intracellular trafficking, and penetration of physiological barriers which block drug access to some tumors.</p>
<h2>Transport across Tissue Barriers</h2>
<p>Nanoparticle or nano-drug delivery is hampered by tissue barriers before the drug can reach the tumor site. Tissue barriers for efficient transporting of nano-drugs to tumor sites include tumor stroma (e.g. biological barriers) and tumor endothelium barriers (e.g. functional barriers). Biological barriers are physical constructs or cell formation that restrict the movement of nanoparticles. Functional barriers can affect the transport of intact nanoparticles or nanomedicine into the tumor mass: elevated interstitial fluid pressure and acidic environment for examples. It is important to design nanoparticles and strategies to overcome these barriers to improve cancer treatment efficacy.</p>

<p>Tumor microenvironment (TME) is a dynamic system composed of abnormal vasculature, fibroblasts and immune cells, all embedded in an extracellular matrix (ECM). TME poses both biological and functional barriers to nano-drug delivery in cancer treatment. Increase cell density and abnormal vasculature elevate the interstitial fluid pressure within a tumor mass. Such pressure gradient is unfavorable for free diffusion of the nanoparticles and is often a limiting factor for the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. When tumor mass reaches 106 cells in number, metabolic strains ensue. Often, cells in the core of this proliferating cluster are distanced by 100-200 um from the source of nutrient: 200um is a limiting distance for oxygen diffusion. As a result, cancer cells in the core live at pO2 levels below 2.5-10mmHg and become hypoxic; anoxic metabolic pathway can kick in and generate lactic acid. Nanoparticles become unstable in an acidic environment and delivery of the drugs to target tumor cells will be unpredictable. ECM of the tumor provides nutrient for cancer cells and stromal cell. It is a collection of fibrous proteins and polysaccharides and expands rapidly in aggressive cancer as the result of stromal cell proliferation. The most notorious biological barrier to cancer treatment is pancreatic stroma in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PADC). Pancreatic cancer stroma has the characteristics of an abnormal and poorly functioning vasculature, altered extracellular matrix, infiltrating macrophages and proliferation of fibroblasts. Not only tumor-stroma interactions have been shown to promote pancreatic cancer cell invasion and metastasis, but TME and tumor stroma also create an unfavorable environment for drug delivery and other forms of cancer treatments.</p>
<p>Because EPR effect is a clinically relevant phenomenon for nano-carriers&rsquo; tumor penetration, strategies have been developed to address the tumor endothelium barrier. Strategies to reduce interstitial fluid pressure to improve tumor penetration include ECM-targeting pharmacological interventions to normalize vasculature within TME; hypertonic solutions to shrink ECM cells; hyperthermia, radiofrequency (RF) or high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) to enhance nano-drug transport and accumulation. These strategies can also alleviate hypoxic conditions in larger tumor mass. Although TME and tumor mass pose a harsh and acidic environment for nano-carrier stability, pH-responsive nano-carrier designs leveraging this unique feature are gaining interest in recent years. Many of the strategies described above are used to address tumor stroma barrier.</p>
<p>Another formidable tissue barrier for drugs and nanoparticle delivery is the blood-brain barrier (BBB). BBB is a physical barrier in the central nervous system to prevent harmful substances from entering the brain. It consists of endothelial cells which are sealed in continuous tight junction around the capillaries. Outside the layer of epithelial cell is covered by astrocytes that further contribute to the selectivity of substance passage. As BBB keeps harmful substances from the brain, it also restricts the delivery of therapeutics for brain diseases, such as brain tumors and other neurological diseases. There have been tremendous efforts in overcoming the BBB for drug delivery in general. The multi-valent feature of nanoparticles makes nano-carriers appealing in designing BBB-crossing delivering strategies. One promising nanoparticle design has transferrin receptor-targeting moiety to facilitate transportation of these nanoparticles across the BBB.</p>

<p>In the fight against cancer, half of the battle is won based on its early detection. Nanotechnology provides new molecular contrast agents and materials to enable earlier and more accurate initial diagnosis as well as in continual monitoring of cancer patient treatment.</p>
<p>Although not yet deployed clinically for cancer detection or diagnosis, nanoparticles are already on the market in numerous medical screens and tests, with the most widespread use that of gold nanoparticles in home pregnancy tests. Nanoparticles are also at the heart of the Verigene&reg; system from Nanosphere and the T2MR system from T2 Biosystems, currently used in hospitals for a variety of indications.</p>
<p>For cancer, nanodevices are being investigated for the capture of blood borne biomarkers, including cancer-associated proteins circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA, and tumor-shed exosomes. Nano-enabled sensors are capable of high sensitivity, specificity and multiplexed measurements. Next generation devices couple capture with genetic analysis to further elucidate a patient&rsquo;s cancer and potential treatments and disease course.</p>
<p>Already clinically established as contrast agents for anatomical structure, nanoparticles are being developed to act as molecular imaging agents, reporting on the presence of cancer-relevant genetic mutations or the functional characteristics of tumor cells. This information can be used to choose a treatment course or alter a therapeutic plan. Bioactivatable nanoparticles that change properties in response to factors or processes within the body act as dynamic reporters of in vivo states and can provide both spatial and temporal information on disease progression and therapeutic response.</p>
<div class="accordion" data-otp-selector="">
<section id="in-vivo">
<h2>Imaging <i>In Vivo</i></h2>
<p>Current imaging methods can only detect cancers once they have made a visible change to a tissue, by which time, thousands of cells will have proliferated and perhaps metastasized. And even when visible, the nature of the tumor&mdash;malignant or benign&mdash;and the characteristics that might make it responsive to a particular treatment must be assessed through tissue biopsies. Furthermore, while some primary malignancies can be determined to be metastatic, tumor pre-seeding of metastatic sites and micro-metastases are extremely difficult to detect with modern imaging modalities, even if the tissue in which they commonly occur are known, <i>a priori</i>. Finally, surgical resection of tumor tissue remains the standard of care for many tumor types and surgeons must weigh the consequences of removing often vital healthy tissue versus the cancerous mass which has grown non-uniformly within. Ultimately, removal of cancer cells at the single cell level is not possible with current surgical techniques.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology based imaging contrast agents being developed and translated today, offer the ability to specifically target and greatly enhance detection of tumor in vivo by way of conventional scanning devices, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (PET), and computed tomography (CT). Moreover, current nanoscale imaging platforms are enabling novel imaging modalities not traditional utilized for clinical cancer treatment and diagnosis, for example photoacoustic tomography (PAT), Raman spectroscopic imaging and multimodal imaging (i.e., contrast agents specific to several imaging modalities simultaneously). Nanotechnology enables all of these platforms by way of its ability to carry multiple components simultaneously (e.g., cancer cell-specific targeting agents or traditional imaging contrast agents) and nanoscale materials that are themselves the contrast agents of which enable greatly enhanced signal.</p>
<p>NCI-funded research has produced many notable examples over the last several years. For example, researchers at Stanford University and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center developed multimodal nanoparticles capable of delineating the margins of brain tumors both preoperatively and intraoperatively. These MRI-PAT-Raman nanoparticles are able to be used both to track tumor growth and surgical staging, by way of MRI, but also in the same particle be used during surgical resection of brain tumor to give the surgeon &lsquo;eyes&rsquo; down to the single cancer cell level, increasing the potential tumor specific tissue removal.</p>
<p>For metastatic melanoma, researchers at MSKCC and Cornell University have developed silica-hybrid nanoparticles (&lsquo;C-dots&rsquo;) that deliver both PET and optical imaging contrast in the same platform. These nanoparticles are actively targeted to the cancer with cRGDY peptides that target this specific tumor type and have already made it successfully through initial clinical trials.</p>
<p>Another clinical cancer imaging problem being addressed by nanoscale solutions is prostate cancer. Researchers at Stanford University recently have been developing nanotechnologies that give both anatomical size and location of prostate cancer cells (nanobubbles for ultrasound imaging) and functional information to avoid overdiagnosis/treatment as well as to monitor progression (self-assemblying nanoparticles for photoacoustic imaging). The nanoplatforms developed by this group are coupled directly to their recently approved handheld transrectal ultrasound and photoacoustic (TRUSPA) device. Ultimately offering a more effective, integrated and less invasive technique to image and biopsy prostate cancers for diagnosis and prognostication prior to performing common interventions (surgical resection, radiotherapy, etc.).</p>
<p>Similarly, gold nanoparticles are being used to enhance light scattering for endoscopic techniques that can be used during colonoscopies. One really powerful potential that has always been envisioned for nanotechnology in cancer has been the potential to simultaneously image and deliver therapy in vivo and several groups have been pushing forward these &lsquo;theranostic&rsquo; nanoscale platforms. One group at Emory University has been developing one of these for ovarian and pancreatic cancers, which are traditionally harder to deliver therapeutics to. Their platform for pancreatic cancer can break through the fibrotic stromal tissue of which these tumors are protected by in the pancreas. After traversing through this barrier, they are composed of magnetic iron cores which allow MRI contrast for diagnosis and deliver small-molecule drugs directly to cancer cells to treat.</p>
<p>Finally, nanotechnology is enabling the visualization of molecular markers that identify specific stages and cancer cell death induced by therapy, allowing doctors to see cells and molecules undetectable through conventional imaging. A group at Stanford has developed the Target-Enabled in Situ Ligand Assembly (TESLA) nanoparticle system. This is based off nanoparticles which form directly in the body after IV-injection of molecular precursors. The precursors contain specific sequences of atoms which can only form larger nanoparticles after being cleaved by enzymes produced by cancer cells during apoptosis (i.e., cell death) and carry various image contrast agents to monitor (PET, MRI, etc.) local tumor response to therapies. Being able to track cancer cell death in vivo and at the molecular level is extremely important for delivering effective dosing regimens and/or precisely administering novel therapies or combinations.</p>

<p>Principle of a triple-modality MRI-photoacoustic-Raman nanoparticle for clinical use. The nanoparticle is injected intravenously. In contrast to small molecule contrast agents that wash out of the tumor quickly, the nanoparticles are stably internalized within the brain tumor cells, allowing the whole spectrum from preoperative MRI for surgical planning to intraoperative imaging to be performed with a single injection. T1-weighted MRI depicts the outline of the tumor due to the T1-shortening effect of the gadolinium. During the surgery, photoacoustic imaging with its greater depth penetration and 3D imaging capabilities can be used to guide the gross resection steps, while Raman imaging can guide the resection of the microscopic tumor at the resection margins. Raman would be used for rapid conformation of clean margins in the operating room instead of the time-consuming analysis of frozen sections.</p>

<h2>Sensing In Vitro</h2>
<p>Nanotechnology-enabled <strong>in vitro diagnostic devices</strong> offer high sensitivity and selectivity, and capability to perform simultaneous measurements of multiple targets. Well-established fabrication techniques (e.g., lithography) can be used to manufacture integrated, portable devices or point-of-care systems. A diagnostic device or biosensor contains a biological recognition element, which through biochemical reaction can detect the presence, activity or concentration of a specific biological molecule in the solution. This reaction could be associated, for example with: binding of antigen and antibody, hybridization of two single stranded DNA fragments, or binding of capture ligand to the cell surface epitope. A transducer part of the detection device is used to convert the biochemical event into a quantifiable signal which can be measured. The transduction mechanisms can rely on light, magnetic, or electronic effects.</p>
<p>Several devices have been designed for detection of various biological signatures from serum or tissue. Few examples of diagnostic devices relying on nanotechnology or nanoparticles are given in Figure #. The bio-barcode assay was designed as a sandwich immunoassay in the laboratory of Chad Mirkin at Northwestern University. It utilizes magnetic nanoparticles (MMPs) which are functionalized with monoclonal antibodies specific to the target protein of interest and then mixed with the sample to promote capture of target proteins. The MMP-protein hybrid structures are then combined with gold nanoparticle (Au-NP) probes which carry DNA-barcodes. Target protein-specific DNA barcodes are released into solution and detected using the scanometric assay with sensitivities in femto-picomolar range.</p>

<p>James Heath&rsquo;s laboratory at Caltech designed sandwich immunoassay devices which rely on DNA-encoded antibody libraries (DEAL). DEAL technique uses DNA-directed immobilization of antibodies in microfluidic channels allowing to convert a pre-patterned single stranded (ss) DNA barcode microarray into an antibody microarray. ssDNA oligomers attached onto the sensor surface are robust and can withstand elevated temperatures of channel fabrication. Subsequent flow-through of the DNA-antibody conjugates in channels transforms the DNA microarray into an antibody microarray and allow to perform multiplex surface-bound sandwich immunoassays. These devices allow for on-chip blood separation and measurement of large protein panels directly from blood.</p>
<p>Diagnostic Magnetic Resonance (DMR) sensor platform was designed in the laboratory of Ralph Weissleder at Massachusetts General Hospital. The DMR mechanism exploits changes in the transverse relaxation signal of water molecules in a magnetic field as a sensing mechanism for magnetic nanoparticle labeled analytes. Highly integrated systems including microfluidic processing circuits and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) detection head with high signal to noise ratio were built and are capable of to detect presence of cells, vesicles, and proteins in clinical samples.</p>

<p>Shan Wang&rsquo;s laboratory at Stanford University designed Giant Magnetoresistive (GMR) biosensors for protein detection. These nanosensors operate by changing their electrical resistance in response to changes in the local magnetic field. They were adapted to detection of biological signatures in solution by implementing a traditional sandwich assay directly on GMR nanosensors. Antibodies are immobilized on the GMR sensor surface and are used as capture probes for the sample containing target proteins. A magnetic particle is used to label the biomolecule of interest in the sample and GMR sensor is used for signal transduction. These sensors were used to measure protein levels in complex sample mixtures and also were employed to assess kinetics of protein interactions.</p>
<p>The devices described above are capable of analyzing large panels of biological signatures at the same time providing for high level of multiplexing. The data analysis can establish correlations among different biomarker levels and map correlations of network signaling and thus provide tools for patient stratification based on their response to different treatments and ultimately improve therapeutic efficacy of the one selected. New advancements in microfluidic technologies opened opportunities to integrate sample preparation and sample processing with biosensors and to realize fully integrated devices that directly deliver full data for a medical diagnosis from a single sample.</p>

<p>Measurement of an individual patient&rsquo;s response to therapeutics during the course of their disease is the basis for precise and prognostic medical care. Accurate and disease relevant monitoring can allow for optimized treatment regimens (e.g., therapeutic course correction, drug combinations, and dose attenuation), preemptive clinical decision making (e.g., therapeutic responders vs. non-responders, and more), and patient stratification for clinical trials. Beyond the more traditional gold standards of in vivo imaging, tissue biopsy and in vitro diagnostics available for this purpose, the &ldquo;liquid biopsy&rdquo; offers the ability to measure response to therapy by way of simple and serial blood draws. Traditional biopsies involve resection of small volumes of the tumor tissue directly, and thus, remain invasive procedures that cannot offer the sampling necessitated to track disease progression relative to the course of therapy or the dynamics of its evolving biology. Liquid biopsies rely on the fact that tumors shed material (e.g., cells, DNA, other cancer-specific biomolecules) into circulation, over time and in response to therapy. Although, the amount of materials shed by any given tumor and / or stage is typically at incredibly low concentrations relative to the rest of the blood&rsquo;s constituents (e.g., erythrocytes, leukocytes, thrombocytes, plasma, etc.). This requires specific and sensitive tools to detect, capture, and purify the circulating tumor material relative to the rest. Nanotechnology is enabling these tools to become reality.</p>

<p>Recent technological advances in the coupling of complex microfluidics and nanoscale materials have allowed the high-purity capture and downstream functional characterization of circulating tumor cells (CTCs), cell-free tumor DNA, microemboli, exosomes, proteins, neoantigens, and more. Recent examples include, capture and subsequent release of CTCs within microfluidic systems to maintain viable cells for downstream whole genome sequencing, ex vivo expansion, RNA sequencing, and more. Of these examples, one type of device uses magnetic nanoparticles to enrich whole blood prior to magnetic separation within the microfluidic and the other device uses thermoresponsive nanopolymers that specifically capture CTCs as they flow through the microfluidic then release upon a change in temperature once blood processing is complete. In both cases, the detection sensitivities are very high (e.g., for enumeration &gt;95%) and capture purity is much higher than other non-nanomaterial based devices. Furthermore, the processing times are increasing every year as the technology evolves, currently averaging 10 mL blood per 30 minutes.</p>

<p>Cancer therapies are currently limited to surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. All three methods risk damage to normal tissues or incomplete eradication of the cancer. Nanotechnology offers the means to target chemotherapies directly and selectively to cancerous cells and neoplasms, guide in surgical resection of tumors, and enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiation-based and other <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1051490" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1051490" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="6654371">current treatment modalities</a>. All of this can add up to a decreased risk to the patient and an increased probability of survival.</p>
<p>Research on nanotechnology cancer therapy extends beyond drug delivery into the creation of new therapeutics available only through use of nanomaterial properties. Although small compared to cells, nanoparticles are large enough to encapsulate many small molecule compounds, which can be of multiple types. At the same time, the relatively large surface area of nanoparticle can be functionalized with ligands, including small molecules, DNA or RNA strands, peptides, aptamers or antibodies. These ligands can be used for therapeutic effect or to direct nanoparticle fate in vivo. These properties enable combination drug delivery, multi-modality treatment and combined therapeutic and diagnostic, known as &ldquo;theranostic,&rdquo; action. The physical properties of nanoparticles, such as energy absorption and re-radiation, can also be used to disrupt diseased tissue, as in laser ablation and hyperthermia applications.</p>
<p>Integrated development of innovative nanoparticle packages and active pharmaceutical ingredients will also enable exploration of a wider repertoire of active ingredients, no longer confined to those with acceptable pharmokinetic or biocompatibility behavior. In addition, immunogenic cargo and surface coatings are being investigated as both adjuvants to nanoparticle-mediated and traditional radio- and chemotherapy as well as stand-alone therapies. Innovative strategies include the design of nanoparticles as artificial antigen presenting cells and in vivo depots of immunostimulatory factors that exploit nanostructured architecture for sustained anti-tumor activity.</p>

<section id="chemotherapy">
<h2>Delivering Chemotherapy</h2>
<p>The traditional use of nanotechnology in cancer therapeutics has been to improve the pharmacokinetics and reduce the systemic toxicities of chemotherapies through the selective targeting and delivery of these anticancer drugs to tumor tissues. The advantage of nanosized carriers is that they can increase the delivered drug&rsquo;s overall therapeutic index through nanoformulations in with chemotherapeutics are either encapsulated or conjugated to the surfaces of nanoparticles. This capability is largely due to their tunable size and surface properties. Size is a major factor in the delivery of nanotechnology-based therapeutics to tumor tissues. Selective delivery of nanotherapeutic platforms depends primarily on the passive targeting of tumors through the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect. This phenomenon relies on defects specific to tumor microenvironment such as defects in lymphatic drainage, along with increased tumor vasculature permeability, to allow nanoparticles (&lt;200 nm) to accumulate in the tumor microenvironment. Furthermore, the timing or site of drug release can be controlled by triggered events, such as ultrasound, pH, heat, or by material composition.</p>
<p>Several members of the Alliance are working towards developing nanomaterial-based delivery platforms that will reduce the toxicity of chemotherapeutics and increase their overall effectiveness. In the Centers for Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence, the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1051523" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1051523" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="6654360">Center for Multiple Myeloma Nanotherapy at Washington University</a> is developing a strategy for photodynamic therapy, which would bypass the toxicity that currently limits the effectiveness of chemotherapy for multiple myeloma patients. This strategy is designed for use in bone marrow, which is normally inaccessible to external radiation sources.</p>
<p>The Innovative Research in Cancer Nanotechnology awardees are focused on understanding the fundamental aspects of nanomaterial interactions with the biological system to improve on the development of cancer therapeutics and diagnostics. Several of these awardees are studying nanoparticle-based delivery and have proposed nanosystems that deliver chemotherapeutics by penetrating through physiological barriers for access to more restricted tumors via targeting and/or mechanical deformation of particles (Yang, Karathanasis, Kabanov). One of them is dedicated to using a synergistic approach for the delivery of paclitaxel and gemcitabine chemotherapeutics in mesoporous silica nanoconstructs (Nel).</p>

<h2>Nano-enabled Immunotherapy</h2>
<p>Immunotherapy is a promising new front in cancer treatment encompassing a number of approaches, including checkpoint inhibition and cellular therapies. Although results for some patients have been spectacular, only a minority of patients being treated for just a subset of cancers experience durable responses to these therapies. Expanding the benefits of immunotherapy requires a greater understanding of tumor-host immune system interactions. New technologies for molecular and functional analysis of single cells are being used to interrogate tumor and immune cells and elucidate molecular indicators and functional immune responses to therapy. To this end, nano-enabled devices and materials are being leveraged to sort, image, and characterize T cells in the Alliance&rsquo;s NanoSystems Biology Cancer Center.</p>

<p>Nanotechnologies are also being investigated to deliver immunotherapy. This includes use of nanoparticles for delivery of immunostimulatory or immunomodulatory molecules in combination with chemo- or radiotherapy or as adjuvants to other immunotherapies. Standalone nanoparticle vaccines are also being designed to raise sufficient T cell response to eradicate tumors, through co-delivery of antigen and adjuvant, the inclusion of multiple antigens to stimulate multiple dendritic cell targets, and continuous release of antigens for prolonged immune stimulation. Molecular blockers of immune-suppressive factors produced can also be co-encapsulated in nanoparticle vaccines to alter the immune context of tumors and improve response, an approach being pursued in the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1051522" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1051522" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="6654361">Nano Approaches to Modulate Host Cell Response for Cancer Therapy Center at UNC</a>.

<h2>Delivering or Augmenting Radiotherapy</h2>
<p>Roughly half of all cancer patients receive some form of radiation therapy over the course of their treatment. Radiation therapy uses high-energy radiation to shrink tumors and kill cancer cells. Radiation therapy kills cancer cells by damaging their DNA inducing cellular apoptosis. Radiation therapy can either damage DNA directly or create charged particles (atoms with an odd or unpaired number of electrons) within the cells that can in turn damage the DNA. Most types of radiation used for cancer treatment utilize X-rays, gamma rays, and charged particles. As such, they are inherently toxic to all cells, not just cancer cells, and are given in doses that are as efficacious as possible while not being too harmful to the body or fatal. Because of this tradeoff between efficacy and safety relative to tumor type, location, and stage, often the efficacy of treatment must remain at reduced levels in order to not be overtly toxic to surrounding tissue or organs near the tumor mass.</p>
<p>Nanotechnology-specific research has been focusing on radiotherapy as a treatment modality that could greatly benefit from nanoscale materials&rsquo; properties and increased tumor accumulation. The primary mechanisms by which these nanoscale platforms rely are either enhancement of the effect of the radiotherapy, augmentation of the therapy, and/or novel externally applied electromagnetic radiation modalities. More specifically, most of these nanotechnology platforms rely on the interaction between X-rays and nanoparticles due to inherent atomic level properties of the materials used. These include high-Z atomic number nanoparticles that enhance the Compton and photoelectric effects of conventional radiation therapy. In essence, increasing efficacy while maintaining the current radiotherapy dosage and its subsequent toxicity to the surrounding tissue. Other platforms utilize X-ray triggered drug-releasing nanoparticles that deliver drug locally at tumor site or to sensitize the cancer cells to radiotherapy in combination with the drug.  </p>
<p>Another type of therapy that relies upon external electromagnetic radiation is photodynamic therapy (PDT). It is an effective anticancer procedure for superficial tumor that relies on tumor localization of a photosensitizer followed by light activation to generate cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Several nanomaterials platforms are being researched to this end. Often made of a lanthanide- or hafnium-doped high-Z core, once injected these can be externally irradiated by X-rays allowing the nanoparticle core to emit the visible light photons locally at the tumor site. Emission of photons from the particles subsequently activate a nanoparticle-bound or local photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) ROS for tumor destruction. Furthermore, these nanoparticles can be used as both PDT that generates ROS and for enhanced radiation therapy via the high-Z core. Although many of these platforms are initially being studied <i>in vivo</i> by intratumoral injection for superficial tumor sites, some are being tested for delivery via systemic injection to deep tissue tumors. The primary benefits to the patient would be local delivery of PDT to deep tissue tumor targets, an alternative therapy for cancer cells that have become radiotherapy resistant, and reduction in toxicity (e.g., light sensitivity) common to traditional PDT. Finally, other platforms utilize a form Cherenkov radiation to a similar end, of local photon emission to utilize as a trigger for local PDT. These can be utilized for deep-tissue targets as well.</p>

<h2>Delivering Gene Therapy</h2>
<p>The value of nanomaterial-based delivery has become apparent for new types of therapeutics such as those using nucleic acids, which are highly unstable in systemic circulation and sensitive to degradation. These include DNA and RNA-based genetic therapeutics such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and microRNAs (miRNAs). Gene silencing therapeutics, siRNAs, have been reported to have significantly extended half-lives when delivered either encapsulated or conjugated to the surface of nanoparticles. These therapeutics are used in many cases to target &lsquo;undruggable&rsquo; cancer proteins. Additionally, the increased stability of genetic therapies delivered by nanocarriers, and often combined with controlled release, has been shown to prolong their effects.</p>
<p>Members of the Alliance are exploring nanotechnology-based delivery of nucleic acids as effective treatment strategies for a variety of cancers. In particular, the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1051519" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1051519" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="6654362">Nucleic Acid-Based Nanoconstructs for the Treatment of Cancer Center at Northwestern University</a> is focused on the design and characterization of spherical nucleic acids for the delivery of RNA therapeutics to treat brain and prostate cancers. Project 1 of the Nano Approaches to Modulate Host Cell Response for Cancer Therapy Center at UNC-Chapel Hill targets vemurafenib resistant melanoma for direct suppression of drug resistance through delivery of siRNA using their polymetformin nanoparticles. Among the Innovative Research in Cancer Nanotechnology awardees, the Ohio State project (Guo), is focused on systematic characterization of <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> RNA nanoparticle behavior for optimized delivery of siRNA to tumor cells, as well as cancer immunotherapeutics.</p>

<h2>University of Texas at MD Anderson Cancer Center</h2>
<p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Konstantin Sokolov, Ph.D., Sunil Krishnan, M.D., and Rebecca Richards-Kortum, Ph.D.</p>
<p><strong>Training Focus and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>Currently, there is a growing gap between new discoveries coming from academic labs and their translation into clinic. To address this problem, we have designed a training program to educate future leaders in the field of nanotechnology with specific interests in cancer translational research. Our program is based on collaboration between The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and Rice University and it combines multidisciplinary mentorship of translational research projects with hands-on coursework and seminar experiences. The program provides predoctoral and post-doctoral training. All trainees will work with at least two program faculty mentors (one from Rice and one from MD Anderson) to carry out an independent research project. In addition, fellows will write a research fellowship grant as an essential part of their preparation for independent careers. Didactic coursework will help T32 fellows to develop the skills needed to define and lead research projects that address barriers to translation of cancer nanotechnology. Incoming trainees will participate in a unique boot camp in "Cancer Management and Nanotechnology" that provides an overview of current opportunities and barriers in the field. Trainees will be introduced to federal resources in cancer nanotechnology by taking a trip to the NCI Nanotechnology Characterization Lab. Finally, trainees will gain lab management skills in an introductory course in laboratory and project management. At completion of the program, fellows will have a deep understanding of translational research in cancer nanotechnology with the demonstrated ability to carry out independent research in this multidisciplinary field.</p>

<p>Over the years, many investigators in the Alliance have transferred their technologies in the form of patents and start-up companies.&nbsp; The Alliance model for translational research is that discoveries made in academic laboratories are handed off to for-profit partners for efficient development into research and clinical products. Alliance members have been eager to bring their technology to the clinic, forming over 100 start-up companies and partnerships with existing biotechnology firms. Many of these start-ups are thriving and now offer products, research or consulting services to the academic and clinical communities. Others have attracted significant investment from large pharmaceutical companies and venture capital funds.</p>

<p><span>Cancer remains one of the most difficult diseases to both diagnosis and treat. Although great strides have been made for some cancers, the incidence and death rate for many other cancers continues to plague the population. In an effort to help advance the clinical translation of novel nanomedicines designed to improve therapeutic outcomes and enhance diagnostic capabilities, the National Cancer Institute, in concert with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), created the <a href="http://ncl.cancer.gov/">Nanotechnology Characterization Laboratory</a>&nbsp;(NCL).</span></p>
<p><span>The NCL has been pursuing preclinical characterization and development of these oncology-directed therapies and diagnostics for more than ten years now. In this time, NCL&rsquo;s multi-disciplinary team has worked with more than 100 of the world&rsquo;s foremost nanotechnology research organizations and evaluated more than 300 different nanomaterials. Nearly a dozen NCL collaborators are now in human clinical trials with novel treatment strategies afforded through nanotechnology. NCL&rsquo;s unique setup has afforded an extraordinary opportunity to explore the biocompatibility trends and advantages and disadvantages of a vast array of nanoplatforms, cytotoxics, and targeting strategies in a relatively limited time span. Through sustained research and extensive educational outreach, the NCL strives to continually improve the pursuit of these much needed therapies, speeding their progression to clinical trials</span>.</p>

<p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Denis Wirtz, Ph.D.</p>
<p><strong>Training Focus and Objectives</strong></p>
<p>The interface between nanotechnology and medicine is a new frontier for scientific exploration and for the creation of new and improved diagnostic and therapeutic tools to detect, treat, cure, and prevent human diseases. We offer an integrated predoctoral and postdoctoral training program in nanotechnology for cancer research (NTCR) that is positioned at this interface. This program fosters predoctoral and postdoctoral fellows who are trained across disciplines to lay foundations for technologies that enable an inside-view of cancer cell functions as opposed to the limited black-box input-output techniques currently used, introduce new modalities for molecular imaging, develop new high-throughput diagnostic tools, and engineer novel drug/antibody/siRNA viral and non-viral delivery systems to treat human cancers. NTCR fellows develop novel cancer diagnostics to evaluate each individual patient's prognosis and optimal treatment, based upon the patients' genetic and epigenetic markers and disease phenotype and therapeutics that are selected and optimized for each individual patient. NTCR trainees take one of two core courses depending on their background, as well as a lab course in cancer nanobiotechnology. They participate in a journal club and a dedicated annual symposium, as well as clinical conferences and tumor boards. The NTCR program recruits outstanding trainees every year with MD and/or PhD degrees and diverse backgrounds in either biochemistry, physics, molecular / cellular / cancer biology, or an engineering/physics discipline for a steady state number of 2 postdoctoral and 6 predoctoral fellows. NTCR fellows take advantage of research and clinical resources at the NCI-designated Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center, the Ludwick Center for Cancer Genetics and Therapeutics, The Sol Goldman Pancreatic Cancer Center, and the In Vivo Cellular and Molecular Imaging Center, as well as the unique educational resources and experimental facilities of the recently established Johns Hopkins Institute for NanoBioTechnology (INBT), which houses the center for cancer nanotechnology excellence (CCNE) and the physical sciences-oncology center (PSOC).</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>Well over a thousand patients have now received chemically distinct, nano-encapsulated chemotherapeutics, generally showing lower toxicity, increased tumoral accumulation of payloads and occasionally improved progression free survival. Experimentally, an even larger number of new constructs and approaches have been pioneered by the NCI Alliance for Nanotechnology in cancer members, as well as other groups. Testing in mice usually involves measuring tumor sizes, survival or the use of histopathology and other molecular diagnostics. Yet, despite these advances, much less is known in the in vivo setting, as to how these nanomaterials actually work or fail, what the spatial and temporal heterogeneity is and how efficacy can be improved. Armed with new biological insight from recent feasibility studies leading to this application and the recent developments of new in vivo imaging technologies we are now able to address these important cancer nanotechnology questions in ways that were not previously possible.</p>
<p>The goal of this project is to perform in vivo imaging analyses of therapeutic nanoparticles (TNP), addressing key questions on nanoparticle distribution (pharmacokinetics, PK) and cellular response (pharmacodynamics, PD). Specifically, we will elucidate the following questions i) why aren't current clinical TNP more efficient (aim 1); ii) how much does tumor targeting with affinity ligands help to improve efficacy (aim 2) and iii) can we select responders from non-responders by nanoparticle enhanced MR imaging (aim 3)? We hypothesize that a considerable proportion of tumor cell accumulation is mediated by tumoral myeloid cells (macrophages) rather than by cancer cells, offering a new strategy to further enhance efficacy. Furthermore, the project is complementary to existing Alliance projects and will be useful to other Alliance members across the consortium through future interactions. It will also provide a much needed biological understanding of nanoparticle enhanced MR imaging findings to interpret clinical data.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The overall goal of this project is the systematic characterization of RNA nanoparticle behavior, in vitro and in vivo, to optimize its delivery to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC). RNA nanoparticles are unique in that their scaffold, ligand, and therapeutic components can all be composed of RNA. They are formed by the bottom up self-assembly, are biocompatible, water soluble, and thermodynamically stable. As such, RNA derived nanoparticles have been shown to be non-toxic therapeutic delivery systems with favorable biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles. The particles themselves are readily manipulated to create varying shapes and sizes with attachments ranging from those feasible for gene therapy to targeting moieties with facile chemical processing. This project proposes to perform thorough and systematic studies on nanoparticle size, shape, and targeting moieties, on cell targeting, internalization/intracellular trafficking, endosomal escape, favorable biodistribution (e.g., without entrapment in liver), immunogenicity, and tumor regression. Once deciphering the factors that constitute the 'ideal' RNA nanoparticle for its efficient therapeutic delivery via the optimum shape, size, and targeting, the investigators will develop two optimized therapeutic systems; one non-immunogenic for the efficient in vivo delivery of siRNA to tumor cells and one that is highly immunogenic for use as a cancer immunotherapy.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The goal of this project is to develop a new therapeutic approach to triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) which is based on intracellular mechanical impact generated by plasmonic nanobubbles. The latter are non-stationary vapor bubbles produced around intracellular gold nanoparticle clusters upon their exposure to a short laser pulse. Following absorption of a laser pulse, a gold cluster instantaneously converts optical energy into localized heat and then vapor, generating mechanical impact and killing the host cell. In this project, gold nanoparticles will be co-administered with liposome-encapsulated drugs and/or radiotherapy to assess the synergy among the three modalities: 1) mechanical impact, 2) chemotherapy aided by drug release from nanobubble-disrupted liposomes, and 3) radiation, which will be enhanced due to the presence of gold nanoclusters. EGFR targeting of nanoparticles will enable accumulation of larger gold clusters in EGFR-expressing cancer cells. This, in turn, will lead to a lower plasmonic bubble generation threshold and higher selectivity of the treatment, so a low-energy laser pulse will be sufficient to kill cancer cells while sparing normal cells.</p>

<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>Ovarian cancer, especially high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC), is the deadliest gynecological cancer with 50-70% five-year mortality rates. Traditional therapy for ovarian cancer has included surgery followed by chemotherapy with platinum/taxane-based regimens. Although most ovarian cancer is initially chemosensitive, recurrence of the disease is common due to development of resistance and significant intra-tumoral heterogenity, both of which contribute to poor prognosis and high mortality rates in patients. Recent clinical and experimental evidence indicate that the monocyte-macrophage axis and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), which make up a portion of the tumor microenvironment, play a significant role in tumor growth and progression by contributing to angiogenesis, invasion and metastasis, and drug resistance, particularly in ovarian cancer and especially in HGSOC. Overall our data indicate that in contrast to conventional drugs that target only tumor cells, targeting the tumor microenvironment is required to achieve maximal anti-tumor efficacy. The use of nanoparticles incorporating specific gene silencing molecules (i.e., siRNA) targeting the tumor or its microenvironment is a particularly attractive approach for overcoming obstacles and reprogramming the tumor microenvironment by silencing critical molecular targets. In this study, we will test the hypothesis that the blockade of tumor and tumor microenvironment interactions by therapeutic nanoparticles will provide significant antitumor activity and enhance the efficacy of current regimens in ovarian cancer. Thus, we will determine the mechanism of TAM regulation. We will also determine the biological and therapeutic efficacy of targeting MMA/TAMs using highly targeted dual effect nanoparticles in ovarian cancer models. These include (1) long-acting, slow-release dual assembly NPs (DANPs), and (2) serum resistant highly specific AXL-receptor binding aptamers.</p>
<p>The proposed approaches offer nanotherapeutic formulations targeting multiple components of the tumor and its microenvironment. Specifically, in aim 1 we are focusing on reprograming the tumor microenvironment by eliminating tumor-promoting TAMs using long-acting, slow release DANPs encapsulating an siRNA for a validated target. This will affect the regulatory cascade of these cells and their impact on inflammation, stromal reactions, and eventual tumor growth. In aim 2, we will develop a multiscale 3D mathematical model to evaluate therapeutic efficacy of the nanoparticles with or without AXL aptamers on the nanoparticle surface, and with or without chemotherapy. The model will be used to understand and predict the effects of this nanoparticle-based treatment on MMA cell accumulation, angiogenesis, and tumor progression in HGSOC models. Finally, in aim 3 we will identify specific AXL aptamers and optimize their chemical modifications to determine which ones enhance nanoparticle effects will maintaining good selectivity and targeting. We will also use multipronged dosing schedules to determine optimal dosing regimens that provide effective pharmacological and efficacy profiles.</p>

<h2>University of California, San Diego</h2>
<p><strong>Principal Investigator:</strong> Dong-Er Zhang, Ph.D., and Andrew Kummel, Ph.D.</p>
<h2>Training Focus and Objectives</h2>
<p>This training program seeks to address two issues (1) In spite of all of the research advances in cancer biology and application of these discoveries to the clinic, cancer therapies have had limited success in prolonging life.&nbsp; Engineering approaches have begun to show promise, but there is a dearth of investigators who are trained in both cancer research and engineering/materials science. (2) Current PhD and postdoctoral training in cancer research focuses on preparing trainees to be independent researchers, but it doesn&rsquo;t provide a comprehensive set of skills for young scientists who, when starting their careers in academia, will be working closely with small/startup pharmaceutical or device companies or who may even work in a small firm before reentering academia.&nbsp; There is a synergy in addressing both issues since young scientists with cross training in nanotechnology and cancer biology are well positioned to work in collaboration with or work in small pharmaceutical or medical device companies focused on cancer.&nbsp; The program provides trainees with a balanced combination of (a) a comprehensive cancer biology, engineering, and entrepreneurship didactic training, (b) laboratory experience mentored by both a basic science cancer researcher and clinical/translational cancer faculty (&ldquo;dual&rdquo; academic mentors), and (c) practical skills learned by having the trainees work directly with small business entrepreneurs and for trainees choosing an academic career path, they were present research proposals as well as make oral presentations at conferences.</p>
