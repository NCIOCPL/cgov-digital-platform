<p>Two case-control studies were conducted in Taiwan between 1991-1994 and 2010-2014. Together, these two studies included more than 2,000 NPC cases and more than 2,400 controls and were designed to examine the role of viral, environmental, and genetic factors associated with the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Factors investigated include Epstein-Barr virus, diet, smoking, occupation, HLA, and other genetic polymorphisms. Histologically confirmed incident cases of nasopharyngeal cancer and two controls groups (hospital and community) were recruited. Participants completed an in-depth, in-person risk factor questionnaire that obtained information on adult and early life exposures. Blood and other specimens were collected from participants to allow for molecular assessment of various environmental and genetic factors of interest.</p>

<p>A family study is currently ongoing in Taiwan to elucidate genetic factors linked to the development of nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). Approximately 350 multiplex families with two or more individuals affected with NPC have been identified and recruited into the study. Active clinic follow-up and passive follow-up via linkage to the national tumor registry is ongoing. Whole-exome sequencing was recently completed and evaluation of viral markers of risk that might be of clinical utility are under evaluation. A risk factor questionnaire is administered to all participants and blood, saliva and nasopharyngeal swabs is collected at study visits to allow us to examine the joint effects of genetic and environmental factors in the pathogenesis of NPC.</p>

<p>The Benign Reproductive Tissue Evaluation (BRTE) Study was initiated by DCEG investigators in collaboration with Magee-Womens Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh, to study the association of risk factors with molecular changes in the ovaries and endometrium. This ongoing study enrolls women undergoing hysterectomy and oophorectomy for benign reasons. An extensive risk factor questionnaire is administered and blood and urine samples are collected before surgery. Normal endometrial and ovarian tissues are collected during surgery.</p>
<p>In the current phase of the study, investigators are also collecting normal ovarian surface epithelial cells intraoperatively using a Tao brush. More than 160 women have been enrolled in the study so far. Several analyses are currently ongoing, including methylation profiling and telomere length measurement of endometrial tissues as well as RNA sequencing and methylation profiling of ovarian surface epithelial cells. Molecular profiles are related to important risk factors for endometrial and ovarian cancers. Following recent evidence that a subset of ovarian cancers may originate in the fallopian tubes, in a planned extension of the study, brush-based sampling of fallopian tubes will be added to the protocol.</p>

<h2>Closed to Patient Enrollment, Data Analysis Ongoing</h2>
<p><a href="http://ovariancancer.gog199.cancer.gov/">The National Ovarian Cancer and Early Detection Study (GOG-0199)</a> is a prospective study of women who are at increased risk of ovarian cancer, either because they or a close relative have a mutation in the <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> genes, or because they have a strong family history of breast and/or ovarian cancer. This study is being led by the Clinical Genetics Branch, in close collaboration with the <a href="http://www.gog.org/">Gynecologic Oncology Group</a> and the <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/CGN/">Cancer Genetics Network</a>. After discussion with their own health care providers, high-risk women chose either risk-reducing surgery or ovarian cancer screening to manage their ovarian cancer risk. Both groups of women have now been followed for five years to assess the impact of their choice on cancer occurrence and quality of life. <b>The clinical phase of this study is complete</b>, having enrolled 2,605 study participants, and efforts are now focused on addressing the specific endpoints that the study was designed to evaluate.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ongoing analyses include: (1) the histopathology of risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy (RRSO) surgical pathology samples obtained from subjects enrolling in the RRSO arm of this study; (2) performance characteristics of the ROCA screening algorithm in the combined GOG-0199/Cancer Genetics Network screening cohort; (3) baseline quality of life in surgical versus screening arm enrollees; (4) medical decision-making among study participants, assessed at the time of study entry; (5) correlation between ovarian volume and levels of clinically important sex-steroid hormones and the effect of RRSO on serum hormone levels; (6) reproducibility of fallopian tube mucosal atypia histologic diagnosis (a blinded review); (7) prospective risk of breast and serous pelvic cancers in study participants; and (8) natural history of <i>BRCA</i> mutation-negative/strong family history positive breast/ovarian cancer families.</p>
<p>There have been two major publications to date from this project, plus a large number of publications related to our collaboration with the Consortium of Modifiers of <i>BRCA1/2</i> ("CIMBA"), which aims to discover other genes which influence the likelihood that mutation carriers will develop breast or ovarian cancer.</p>

<p>This population-based case-control study of ovarian and endometrial cancer was conducted among female residents of Warsaw and Lodz (Poland) between 2001 and 2003. Investigators in DCEG identified all women with histologically-confirmed ovarian and endometrial carcinoma through a rapid ascertainment system in participating hospitals and cancer registries. The collection of biological specimens included blood, urine, and paraffin-embedded tumor tissue. Control women were randomly selected from complete population lists and were frequency matched to cases on age and study site. A personal interview and blood/mouthwash sample was collected. A total of 347 women with invasive ovarian cancer and 555 women with endometrial cancer were enrolled. Researchers share 2,798 controls between breast, ovarian, and endometrial cancer cases. Researchers constructed tissue microarrays including tumor samples from approximately 200 ovarian cancer cases and 300 endometrial cancer cases for immunohistochemical analyses. Nucleic acids were extracted from tissue cores to create a resource for DNA-based studies.</p>
<p>Investigators are conducting the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyses of questionnaire-based factors and anthropometric/physical activity measurements in relation to cancer risk and clinical outcomes;</li>
<li>Identifying genetic susceptibility markers of cancer risk and clinical outcomes using candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWAS) approaches;</li>
<li>Analyses of tissue/tumor markers to evaluate relationships with cancer risk factors (known or suspected), and their impact on predicting recurrence and survival after diagnosis;</li>
<li>Analyses of biomarkers in DNA (somatic changes), cryopreserved blood cells, serum/plasma, and urine in relationship to cancer risk and clinical outcomes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Current projects include methylation profiling, tumor gene sequencing, microsatellite instability analysis, and immunohistochemistry to study the etiologic heterogeneity of endometrial and ovarian cancers.</p>

<h2>Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Observational Study Cohort</h2>
<p>In collaboration with investigators from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative, investigators in DCEG are conducting a nested case-control study of endometrial and ovarian cancers to assess the roles of estrogens, estrogen metabolites, and androgens in the etiologies of these cancers. Cases and shared controls have been drawn from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative Observational Study (WHIOS) cohort. This effort benefits from unique WHIOS resources, including large numbers of cancer cases, prospectively collected serum and baseline data on important cancer risk factors.</p>
<p>A comprehensive profile of endogenous estrogens, including 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites, were measured in pre-diagnostic serum using the LC-MS/MS assay developed at the Protein Characterization Laboratory at the Frederick National Cancer Center. These measures were examined in relation to ovarian (n~169) and endometrial (n~313) cancers. For ovarian cancer, we found striking heterogeneity in risks by histologic subtype with results supporting a role for estrogen metabolites in the etiology of non-serous, but not serous ovarian cancers. Elevated circulating levels of both parent estrogens and estrogen metabolites were associated with increased endometrial cancer risk, suggesting that estrogen receptor-mediated mechanisms explain a portion of the effects of obesity on endometrial cancer risk. Within this study, investigators have also evaluated the full panel of circulating estrogens and estrogen metabolites to investigate relationships with cancer risk factors (e.g., body mass index, sedentary behavior, alcohol use). Currently underway are efforts to evaluate associations of 11 androgens and androgen metabolites as measured by LC-MS/MS to ovarian and endometrial cancer risks as well as cancer risk factors.</p>

<p>The Ghana Prostate Study is designed to assess the burden, risk factor profiles and biomarkers of prostate cancer in Ghanaian men. In the United States, incidence rates of prostate cancer in African-Americans are 1.6-fold higher than those observed in European Americans, yet the causes of this difference remain unknown. Since West Africa is the principal ancestral origin of a substantial proportion of African-American men, one may hypothesize that genetic susceptibility loci that vary in allele frequency by ancestral population could account for part of the observed differences in prostate cancer rates within the U.S. In addition, little is known about the prostate cancer risk factors in African men.</p>

<p>The Ghana Prostate Study has two components: a clinical component to recruit prostate cancer cases in Accra, the capital of Ghana, and a population screening survey component to estimate the prevalence of prostate cancer in the male Accra population. The clinical component of the study includes the collection of clinical and pathological data for&nbsp;677 prostate cancer cases. The population component of the study includes 1,000 healthy men who underwent screening using serum prostate specific antigen (PSA) testing and digital rectal examination, followed by biopsy confirmation as required. Interviews elicited information on demographics, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, body size, medical history, health care utilization, and urinary symptoms. Blood samples are being used for PSA testing and for measurements of genetic, hormonal, and nutritional markers.</p>

<p>Gastric cancer and nasopharyngeal carcinoma are the only two epithelial tumors known to be associated with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection. However, in contrast to near universal involvement in nasopharyngeal carcinoma, only 8-10 percent&nbsp;of gastric cancers are positive for EBV. Despite differences in primary etiology of cancers of the upper (cardia) and lower (noncardia)&nbsp;stomach, EBV-positive tumors occur at both of these anatomic subsites.&nbsp;To date, most studies that have evaluated EBV-associated gastric cancer have been modest in size, and it is unclear whether co-factors associated with these cancers differ from those associated with the more common EBV-negative tumors.

<p>This case-control study is evaluating environmental and genetic risk factors for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) in Golestan Province, Iran. Age standardized ESCC incidence rates of 109/100,000 in men and 175/100,000 in women were reported from this area in the 1970s, and no studies have been performed since that time. Atrak Clinic, a referral clinic for upper gastrointestinal diseases, was recently established in Golestan Province by physicians from the Digestive Diseases Research Center of Tehran University of Medical Sciences, and this Clinic serves as the field center for this study. All patients referred to the Clinic routinely undergo upper endoscopy and biopsy for evaluation and diagnosis. Patients who have histologically confirmed ESCC and consent to join the study have been enrolled as cases. Two control groups have also been enrolled in this study, one selected from the neighborhoods of case subjects (primary controls) and one from the patients referred to Atrak Clinic who do not have cancer (secondary controls). Both the cases and the controls were interviewed and underwent collection of biological specimens including blood, hair and nails. After a 3 1/2 year accrual period (2003-2007) 300 cases, 571 neighborhood controls and 300 Atrak Clinic controls were successfuly enrolled and are currently being analyzed. Environmental risk factors (including life-style, habits, and nutritional status) are being assessed through questionnaires and objective measurements in biological specimens. The role of genetic polymorphisms is also being studied using genomic DNA from cases and controls.

<p>The Nutrition Intervention Trials (NIT) were launched in 1985 as randomized controlled trials which tested the effects of multiple vitamin and mineral interventions on total mortality and total and cause-specific cancer mortality in a rural Chinese population. The original goal of the NIT was to evaluate the role of nutrition in the etiology and prevention of upper gastrointestinal cancers in over 32,000 residents in Linxian, China. With the conclusion of the intervention phase in 1991, and the determination that the micronutrient combination of selenium/vitamin E/&szlig;-carotene reduced total mortality, total cancer mortality, and gastric cancer mortality, objectives now include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Determination of post-trial effects of the interventions;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Evaluation of etiologic hypotheses, including nutrition, carcinogens, infections, genetics, and other exposures;&nbsp;</li>
<li>Studies of natural history; and&nbsp;</li>
<li>Examination of interactions (gene-environment, gene-gene, and gene-intervention).</li>
</ul>
<p>In collaboration with the Cancer Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences in Beijing, DCEG investigators continue to follow trial participants to ascertain endpoints, conduct nested case-control and case-cohort studies using baseline serum, and perform expanded DNA and biochemical analyses on additional blood samples collected during follow-up. To date, investigators have accrued almost 3,500 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cases and over 2,500 gastric adenocarcinoma cases among the original 32,000 subjects.</p>

<p>The Upper Gastrointestinal Cancer Genetic Studies in Shanxi Province, China, were started to look for major susceptibility genes for upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers and to identify the genetic changes associated with their development. This project was initiated to study esophageal squamous cell carcinomas, but also includes other UGI cancers (gastric cardia cancer and gastric non-cardia cancer).&nbsp; The project goals include:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of somatic genetic alterations, including changes that might serve as early detection biomarkers</li>
<li>Examination of cancer-associated germline genetic variants to identify major risk and moderate risk susceptibility genes to enable development of risk stratification strategies and to gain a better understanding of the biology of these UGI cancers</li>
</ul>
<p>Following a pilot study in 1995, we initiated a collaboration with the Shanxi Cancer Hospital and Institute, Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, China in 1996 to perform clinical and field studies. These studies have been the core of our UGI cancer genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in Asians.</p>
<h4>Tumor/non-tumor study</h4>
<p>To enable study of somatic alterations in tumors, we developed a tumor/non-tumor study by recruiting cancer cases surgically resected at the Shanxi Cancer Hospital, who answer a standardized risk factor questionnaire and provide a blood sample and tumor/non-tumor surgical specimens.</p>
<h4>Endoscopy study</h4>
<p>To permit evaluation of somatic molecular markers in pre-malignant tissues in our search for early detection markers, we added an endoscopy study in 2006, which targets collection of esophageal biopsies, blood, and risk factor questionnaire data on patients presenting to the Endoscopy Clinic at the Shanxi Cancer Hospital.</p>
<h4>Family study</h4>
<p>To examine germline genetic variants in relation to cancer in our search for major risk susceptibility genes, we developed a family study, which recruits highly informative multiplex families (pedigrees with 2+ UGI cancer cases and available DNA) and obtains blood samples and questionnaire-based risk factor information on all living first-degree relatives over 20 years of age for linkage (and association study) analysis.</p>
<h4>Case-control study</h4>
<p>To evaluate germline genetic variants in relation to cancer in our search for moderate risk susceptibility genes, as well as to study environment, gene-environment, and gene-gene interactions, we developed a case-control study that enrolls histologically-confirmed UGI cancer cases and neighborhood-matched controls, obtains information from a structured risk factor questionnaire, and collects biologic samples (a venous blood sample, a finger stick blood sample, a buccal smear, and a tumor specimen from surgical resections of cases).</p>

<p>Testicular cancer is the most common form of cancer in young men ages 15 to 35. It accounts for about one percent of all cancer in men, with approximately 7,400 cases diagnosed in the United States every year. It is much more common in white males than in black males. DCEG investigators are conducting the <a href="http://familial-testicular-cancer.cancer.gov/">Familiar Testicular Cancer Study</a> to pursue research into the genetic causes of testicular cancer, &nbsp;using carefully-collected biological samples from members of multiple-case families, in which we are also studying the relationship between testicular microlithiasis (calcium deposits within testicular tissue) and the risk of familial testicular cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Previous work has focused on defining the clinical characteristics of the familial testicular cancer syndrome. This is proving to be a remarkably interesting project because the genetic mechanisms that are just now being identified seem quite different from those that had been previously found to cause other hereditary cancer disorders such as hereditary breast and hereditary colon cancer. The current hypothesis is that familial testicular cancer results from the combined effects of many genes, each of which by itself causes only a small increase in cancer risk. Those genes appear to be deeply involved in the normal growth and development of the testes in the fetus, and in regulating male fertility and the production of sperm.</p>

<p>Testicular germ cell cancer has been increasing among men during most of the 20th century. Despite this increase, the etiology of testicular cancer is poorly understood. To better understand the molecular epidemiology of testicular cancer, the National Cancer Institute and the Department of Defense are conducting a case-control study of testicular cancer among military servicemen. The project includes obtaining biosamples and questionnaire data from all participants. Pre-diagnostic serum samples are available from the approximately 1,100 cases and 1,100 controls enrolled in the study. Mothers of all participants are also invited to participate by donating a biosample and responding to a questionnaire.</p>
<h4>Hormone Levels Related to Testicular Germ Cell Tumors in STEED</h4>
<p>Testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs) are cancers that occur, primarily, among young men. TGCTs, as well as several other male reproductive disorders, may have a perinatal etiology that also results in aberrant hormonal levels. To examine this hypothesis, investigators in DCEG have been studying hormone levels in men who went on to develop TGCT and men who did not, as part of the STEED study. Thus far, investigators have examined the gonadotropins, LH and FSH, the steroid hormones, estradiol, testosterone, and sex- androstane-3a,17&szlig;-diol glucuronide (3adiol-G) levels, and sex-hormone binding globulin. To more completely characterize the hormonal milieu that may precede TGCT, DCEG investigators also plan to examine hCG, inhibin, dihydrotestosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and androsterone glucuronide.</p>

<p>The heritability of testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT) is high, with studies suggesting TGCT risks of eight-fold in brothers and four-fold in fathers of affected men, compared to men in the general population. However, genome-wide association studies of single-nucleotide polymorphisms have found limited heritable risk. In addition to TGCT being a complex genetic disease, with many alleles contributing small changes in risk, heritable risk could also manifest itself in DNA methylation which can affect gene expression. Recent studies examining genes involved in tumor suppression or cell-cycling have suggested there may be differences in methylation patterns between normal and TGCT tissue. At the National Cancer Institute, investigators have the opportunity to use a high-throughput assay to assess methylation across 450,000 genes. This study will compare the methylation profiles of specific TGCT histologies, such as seminoma, embryonal carcinoma and teratoma, with one another and with adjacent &lsquo;normal&rsquo; tissue. This agnostic and powerful approach may provide clues into the etiology of TGCTs.</p>

Early studies focused on surveys of professionals who are potentially exposed to formaldehyde in their work, such as anatomists and embalmers (Walrath and Fraumeni, 1983; Walrath and Fraumeni, 1984; Stroup et al., 1986; Hayes et al., 1990). Although these early studies reported that these professionals were at increased risk for leukemia compared to the general population, they did not evaluate specific exposures or work practices.</p>

<p>More recently, OEEB scientists conducted a study investigating the relationship between work practices and formaldehyde exposure with risk for selected malignancies among workers in the funeral industry. Occupational histories were obtained from next of kin and co-workers for cases of lymphohematopoietic malignancies (n=167) and for a control group of deaths due to other causes. Risk of death from myeloid (n=34) but not other types of leukemia, was increased among those whose peak exposure to formaldehyde was highest. There was also evidence that greater than average levels of exposure to formaldehyde in these jobs was related to risk of death from myeloid leukemia (Hauptmann et al., 2009).</p>
<p>In the NCI Formaldehyde Industrial Cohort study, which began in the 1980s and includes 25,619 workers in industries with potential formaldehyde exposure, OEEB scientists estimated exposure based on work histories and plant-specific measurement data. In the most recent publication from this cohort that focused on deaths from lympohematopoietic malignancies, a possible link between formaldehyde exposure and lymphohematopoietic malignancies, particularly myeloid leukemia (n=48), was observed with peak exposure. When cumulative risk was evaluated, risks declined steadily over time, such that the cumulative excess risk of myeloid leukemia was no longer statistically significant at the end of the follow-up period. Similar to patterns of risk over time seen for known leukemogens, the risk for myeloid leukemia appeared to be highest earlier in the follow-up period. By the end of the follow-up period, the risk was no longer statistically significant (Beane Freeman et al., 2009). Formaldehyde exposure was also associated with increased risk of death from nasopharyngeal cancer, a rare malignancy.&nbsp;No association with lung cancer was observed in this update of the cohort (Beane Freeman et al., 2013).</p>

<h2>Molecular Epidemiology Study of Formaldehyde</h2>
<p>In the first chromosome-wide association study (CWAS) using cultured myeloid progenitor cells from workers exposed to formaldehyde, there was an increase in monosomy and trisomy of multiple chromosomes and an increase in structural chromosomal aberrations of chromosome 5 (Lan et al., 2015), which are often present in acute myeloid leukemia. Formaldehyde exposure was also associated with a decrease in levels of CD8<sup>+</sup> effector memory T cells and regulatory T cells (Hosgood et al., 2013).</p>
<p>Results from these studies have been cited in several reviews on the carcinogenicity of formaldehyde, including those conducted by the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the National Toxicology Program Report on Carcinogens Outside Expert Panel.</p>

<p>In March 2012, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) completed a retrospective cohort mortality and nested case-control study of 12,315 workers at eight non-metal mining facilities to investigate risk of lung cancer in relation to quantitative measures of historical exposure to diesel exhaust, after taking into account smoking and other lung cancer risk factors. Elevated mortality from other causes among diesel exhaust-exposed miners was examined as well. An extensive effort to characterize current and historical exposures to diesel exhaust and to develop estimates of personal exposures was an intrinsic part of the study. The methods for this effort were published in five papers in the <i>Annals of Occupational Hygiene</i>. In 2012, results from the NCI-led case-control study and the NIOSH-led cohort study were published in the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>.

<p>DCEG researchers in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) investigate a number of water contaminants that are thought to be associated with cancer risk. These include naturally-occurring substances, like arsenic, fertilizer by-products like nitrate, as well as compounds formed when chlorine to disinfect water comes into contact with organic material in water.</p>

<h3><a id="Arsenic"></a>Arsenic</h3>
<p>Ingestion of high levels of arsenic is an accepted cause of bladder cancer, but risk at lower levels is uncertain. Large populations are needed to adequately characterize bladder cancer risk from lower levels of arsenic exposure in drinking water.&nbsp;DCEG investigators&nbsp;conducted the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=32&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=438648" sys_contentid="438648" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="438648" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7271121" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418">New England Bladder Cancer Study</a>, a population-based case-control study in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont, to identify risk factors that might explain the persistent high rates in these states, to evaluate exposure to arsenic at low to moderate levels, and to evaluate possible gene-exposure interactions. Exposure to arsenic and other drinking water contaminants (i.e., DBP and nitrates) was assessed based on drinking water samples taken at current and former homes, monitoring data obtained from public water utilities, and a geographic information system (GIS)-based predictive model based on geologic characteristics at the wells when measurements were missing. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Disinfection-Byproducts"></a>Disinfection Byproducts</h3>
<p>Chlorine interacts with organic materials in water to form a mixture of disinfection byproducts (DBP). Although concentrations in the United States are quite low, there is concern that some chemicals in the mixture may increase cancer risk. A DCEG study of six cancer sites conducted in Iowa found associations of rectal and bladder cancers with long-term (&gt;40 years) exposure to drinking water high in these unintentional byproducts. The data from these and additional cancer sites included in the study are under evaluation following an improved historical exposure assessment effort in which DBP exposures were estimated for each individual water utility, taking into account changes in water source and treatments over time.</p>
<p>Studies indicate that dermal and inhalation exposures to trihalomethanes (THM), a major component of DBPs in treated water, can be significant. With collaborators in Spain,&nbsp;DCEG investigators&nbsp;evaluated DBP in relation to bladder cancer risk in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303543" sys_contentid="303543" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303543" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7271122" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418">Interdisciplinary Case-Control Study of Bladder Cancer in Spain</a>, considering exposure via ingestion, showering/bathing, and swimming in pools. THM exposure estimates revealed an excess of bladder cancer among individuals with estimated household levels above 49 mg/L and the association was modified by polymorphisms in DBP metabolizing enzymes. A similar elevation of risk was seen in the New England Bladder Cancer Study at the same levels of THM exposure, and confirmed the risk observed associated with showering/bathing. In this study, there was also indication that brominated species were potentially more important than the chlorinated species, which is supported by the toxicologic data.</p>
<p>DCEG investigators are now evaluating interactions with genes involved in pathways that activate or detoxify DBP. With collaborators at the University of Minnesota and the University of Iowa, they evaluated intake of DBP from public drinking water in relation to cancer risk in the Iowa Women&rsquo;s Health Study. They found that women with higher average THM in public water supplies had increased risks of rectal cancer, but evidence of associations with colon, kidney, bladder, and ovarian cancers was inconsistent. These analyses considered concomitant exposure to nitrate, another common drinking water contaminant.</p>

<h3><a id="Nitrate"></a>Nitrate</h3>
<p>Contamination of drinking water by nitrate is a growing problem in many agricultural areas of the country. Ingested nitrate can lead to the endogenous formation of N-nitroso compounds (NOC), which are potent animal carcinogens. Population-based case-control studies in Iowa and Nebraska evaluated community-supplied drinking water nitrate levels and cancers of the stomach, esophagus, bladder, brain, colon, rectum, pancreas, and kidney. Increased risks of colon, kidney, and stomach cancer were observed among those with higher ingestion of water nitrate and higher meat intake compared with low intakes of both, a dietary pattern that results in increased NOC formation.</p>
<p>With collaborators at the University of Minnesota and the University of Iowa, DCEG investigators are evaluating nitrate intake from drinking water in relation to cancer risk in the Iowa Women&rsquo;s Health Study. So far, they found that women with higher average nitrate levels in public water supplies had increased risks of thyroid, ovarian, bladder, and kidney cancers. There was no association with drinking water nitrate ingestion and colorectal and pancreas cancers.&nbsp;The population using private wells can have considerably higher exposure to nitrate because private wells are not regulated, and because&nbsp;they are often located in agricultural areas. Using a Geographic Information System (GIS)-based model that incorporates land use, soil characteristics, nitrogen inputs, and other factors, DCEG investigators estimated private well nitrate levels for the Agricultural Health Study cohort and are evaluating cancer risk among the applicators and their spouses.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators seek to clarify the roles of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and common variants in genes controlling immunity and inflammation on the risk of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma. In collaboration with the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study, the interactions of EBV load, EBV cellular and humoral immunity, and variants in candidate genes are being studied in 181 incident lymphomas and matched controls. To identify novel genetic associations, investigators plan to genotype 800 additional cases assembled from several sources with a haplotype-tagging panel of more than 150 genes on pathways implicated in lymphomagenesis.</p>

<p>Estrogens play important roles in the pathophysiology of breast tumors and are recognized causal factors in the etiology of breast cancer; this central insight has led to many of the available preventive and therapeutic interventions for breast cancer. Endogenous estrogens may also play causal roles in endometrial and ovarian cancers and could also be important in male reproductive cancers, such as male breast cancer, testicular cancer, and prostate cancer. Substantial inter-individual variability has been observed in levels of circulating and excreted estrogens and estrogen metabolites (jointly referred to as EM) among men, postmenopausal women, and premenopausal women. Because EM vary with respect to bioavailability, affinity to estrogen receptors, and mutagenic potential, investigators have hypothesized that variations in estrogen profiles may account for inter-individual differences in cancer risks. Until recently, it has been difficult to study this hypothesis in epidemiologic settings. Development of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) method for measurement of estrogens and estrogen metabolites in urine (Xu et al., <i>Anal Chem</i> 2006;78:1553) and serum (Xu et al., <i>Anal Chem</i> 2007;79:7813) represents an important methodologic development because it provides an assay with characteristics that make it feasible for use in epidemiologic studies: high sensitivity, specificity, reliability, and scalability for high-throughput work.</p>
<p>Expanding on our research evaluating endogenous estrogens and estrogen metabolites and cancer risk, recent methodologic advances in the measurement of androgens and androgen metabolites as well as progesterone, pregnenolone, and progesterone metabolites in serum will facilitate epidemiologic studies to evaluate the role of principal estrogens, androgens and progesterone, together with their major metabolites, in cancer etiology.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://hivmatch.cancer.gov/">HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study</a> is designed to examine cancer risk in people living with HIV infection in the United States. The study utilizes data collected by state and regional HIV and cancer registries throughout the United States. The NCI uses these study data to determine the spectrum of cancers that occur in HIV-infected people. The risk of cancer in HIV-infected people is compared with that in the general population to determine which cancers arise more frequently than expected. Investigators compare different groups of HIV-infected people to determine whether certain individuals are at especially high risk of cancer. Through frequent updates of the data, investigators also monitor changing trends in cancer risk over time.</p>
<p>People who are infected with HIV have an elevated risk for some cancers. This high risk occurs because HIV weakens the immune system, and because many other cancer risk factors are common in HIV-infected people. By studying the patterns of cancer among HIV-infected people, DCEG investigators seek to better understand how the immune system protects people from developing cancer. Another goal of the study is to look for trends in cancer risk in the HIV populations and identify important opportunities for cancer prevention.</p>

<p>Altered immunity and chronic inflammation appear to play a key role in the etiology of several malignancies. DCEG researchers investigate the role of the immune system in cancer etiology, measuring immune response as part of the host response to exogenous exposures. For example, we are closely examining the substantially elevated cancer risk among solid organ transplant recipients who receive long-term immunosuppressant medications to prevent organ rejection. We are also considering how chronic inflammation from infection is related to cancer risk, as demonstrated by <i>H. pylori</i> with gastric cancer and periodontal hygiene with oral and esophageal cancers. Examples of studies involving immunologic factors include:</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;">DCEG researchers conduct studies in the United States and abroad to identify and evaluate environmental and workplace exposures that may be associated with cancer risk. Workers often have heavier and more prolonged exposures to hazardous chemicals that also occur in the general environment, but at lower levels. When excess risks are detected from workplace studies, they may provide important leads as to the etiology of cancer in other settings. Occupational studies have identified many chemicals that cause cancer in humans, and they have provided direction for initiatives aimed at reducing or eliminating these carcinogens in the workplace and elsewhere.

<p>There is substantial variation in the annual mean concentration of radon in the same North American homes measured several years apart. These findings call into question the assumption that year-long indoor air radon measurements offer a valid estimate of cumulative radon exposures in homes over a period of 15-20 years, the most biologically meaningful exposure period. All previous studies used detectors that measure current radon in air. In a new case-control study, DCEG investigators carried out both standard year-long air measurements and CR-39 alpha detector measurements (call surface monitors) which directly measure long-term (20- year and more) cumulative exposure using glass objects in the home. The surface monitors take advantage of the fact that the first long-lived radon progeny, 210-lead (half-life 22 yrs), becomes embedded in glass surfaces in homes. The alpha activity of 210-polonium, a decay product of 210-lead, is measured in glass objects in the home and serves as a long-term retrospective exposure-meter for residential radon. This population-based case-control study of lung cancer was specifically designed to complement an earlier DCEG study by evaluating the effect of cumulative residential radon exposure among Missouri women who were predominantly smokers and former smokers using a control selection technique that minimized the inherent imbalance in smoking frequency between cases and controls.</p>

<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV), the cause of cervical cancer, is recognized as an important cause of some oropharyngeal, vulvar, and anal cancers. Given the many similarities between HPV-related cancers at the cervix and other anatomic sites, researchers are optimistic that the HPV vaccine will&nbsp;provide long-term protection&nbsp;against extra-cervical infections with high vaccine efficacy. In fact, the vaccine has already been shown to confer near-complete protection over four years against oral, vulvar/vaginal, and anal HPV infections&nbsp;for targeted HPV types.&nbsp;To determine whether the HPV 16/18 prophylactic vaccine protects against HPV 16/18 infections in the oral, vulvar, and anal regions over 10 years, DCEG investigators recently completed collection of oral, vulvar, and anal specimens from women in the long-term follow-up phase of the&nbsp;NCI-sponsored Costa Rican community-based randomized phase III clinical trial and plan to test these specimens for presence of HPV DNA. The main aim of this proof-of-principle study is to determine the long-term&nbsp;impact of HPV vaccination in preventing infections at all mucosal epithelial surfaces.</p>

<p>Acrylonitrile is a commercially important chemical used in the production of synthetic fibers and resins, plastics, nitrile rubbers, and many other products. Results from animal bioassays and epidemiologic studies suggest it might cause cancers of the lung, brain, prostate, stomach, hematopoietic and lymphatic systems.

<p>The NCI Acrylonitrile Cohort is a study of 25,460 workers employed at eight facilities that produce or use acrylonitrile in the United States.&nbsp;Follow-up of this cohort through 1989 found no elevated risk for any cancer, but there was an excess for lung cancer in the highest quintile of cumulative exposure more than 20 years after first exposure. The NCI cohort is the largest study to date, with the most detailed exposure assessment.&nbsp;Currently, the mortality experience of the cohort is being extended an additional 20 years to re-evaluate the association between acrylonitrile exposure and cancer mortality, as well as other health outcomes.</p>

<p>The inherited bone marrow failure syndromes (IBMFS) are a group of <b>rare genetic blood disorders</b> in which there is usually some form of aplastic anemia (failure of the bone marrow to produce blood), associated with a family history of the same disorder. Some of these conditions have typical changes in physical appearance or in laboratory findings which suggest a specific diagnosis. There are several well-described syndromes, which can be recognized by health care experts. There are also patients who are harder to classify, but who appear to belong in this category. Patients with these syndromes have a very high risk of development of cancer (either leukemia or certain solid tumors).</p>
<p>The major disorders are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia (Amega)</li>

<p>Li-Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is an inherited disorder that leads to a higher risk of certain cancers, including sarcomas, brain tumors, breast cancer, and many others. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and is often the result of heritable changes in the <i>TP53</i> gene. The NCI has evaluated families with LFS since the syndrome was first recognized in 1969. DCEG is now expanding this research through a clinical study and participation in a multi-institutional collaboration. This <a href="http://lfs.cancer.gov/">LFS study</a> is now open to patient enrollment.

<p>Energy balance &mdash; the difference between dietary energy intake and energy expended through physical activity and resting metabolism &mdash; has been implicated in a host of diseases, including cancer. This is an area of research of great significance, since two-thirds of the adult U.S. population and at least one-half of the population of many other developed countries are now overweight or obese.</p>
<p>DCEG&rsquo;s research portfolio includes studies that focus on different aspects of energy balance, including the effects of body mass index (BMI), dietary intake, and physical activity on various malignancies. Longitudinal cohorts, case-control studies, and dietary assessment methodological studies provide valuable data to DCEG researchers. &nbsp;Data include dietary intake, physical activity, and anthropometric characteristics, such as waist circumference.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pharmaceutical agents may increase or decrease cancer risk. DCEG researchers actively investigate the use of over-the-counter medications like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (commonly known as NSAIDs), or prescription drugs like those that reduce cholesterol levels. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Exogenous hormones, like those commonly found in oral contraceptives or menopausal hormone therapy, or more rarely in medications like diethylstilbestrol (DES), are also associated with cancer risk.&nbsp;DCEG researchers evaluate the use of these medications, as well as how they relate to other factors to influence risk of breast, ovarian, or other cancers.

<p>Tobacco use is well understood to be a risk factor for cancer. Although smoking rates in the United States have declined, tobacco continues to exert a tremendous burden on the health of populations in the U.S. and world-wide. Investigators throughout DCEG have used case-control, prospective studies, and consortia to characterize changing associations between cigarette smoking and cancer, and are engaged in determining the health risks of other tobacco and tobacco-related products, including smokeless tobacco, flavored cigarillos, electronic cigarettes, and hookah (water pipe).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Viral and bacterial infections are known to cause a number of different malignancies in populations world-wide. DCEG carries out multidisciplinary studies of carefully selected populations in the United States and abroad, with the goal of clarifying the relationship of infectious agents, especially viruses, to human cancer and other conditions. Recent research has concentrated on human retroviruses (HIV-1), with additional studies on human papillomaviruses (HPV), hepatitis viruses, and papovaviruses.</p>

<p>NCI launched the Vitamin D Pooling Project (VDPP) in 2007 with the goal of providing reliable estimates of the relative risk of cancer that would fill the gaps in knowledge of the associations between vitamin D levels and cancer. Through the use of the resources available in the NCI Cohort Consortium, funding was allocated for measuring circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) in prospectively collected and stored samples of plasma and serum from eight extramural cohorts supported by the NCI Division of Cancer Control and Populations Sciences and from two DCEG cohorts. The VDPP examined associations between vitamin D and cancer at several less common sites, including cancers of the endometrium, kidney, ovary, pancreas, stomach, and esophagus, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The results from the VDPP were published in nine articles in the July 1, 2010, issue of the <i>American Journal of Epidemiology</i>, including an overview, a description of the project design and methods, findings on the correlates of circulating vitamin D, and six cancer site&ndash;specific reports. Investigators found that women and men with higher concentrations of circulating vitamin D did not experience reduced risk for any of the cancers examined during the follow-up periods for the cohorts. The analysis of pancreatic cancer, however, found a significantly elevated risk in a relatively small number of subjects with circulating 25(OH)D greater than 100 nmol/L, which represents approximately the 95th percentile of the U.S. population.</p>

<p>DCEG investigates the biological basis of inherited and acquired genetic variants associated with cancer susceptibility, utilizing genome-wide association studies, exome sequencing, and candidate gene studies. DCEG scientists and their collaborators employ and array of advanced statistical methods to support these studies.</p>
<h4>Genome-wide Association Studies</h4>
<p>A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach that involves scanning the genomes from many different people and looking for genetic markers that can be used to predict the presence of a disease. The goal is to understand how genes contribute to the disease and to use that understanding to help develop better prevention and treatment strategies. DCEG has developed a robust research program with GWAS for a number of cancers, and more recently, exposures and survival. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1057944" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7271314" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1057944" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1057944">Read more about genome-wide association studies</a>.</p>
<h4>Exome Studies</h4>
<p>Whole exome sequencing enables researchers to sequence all of the exons (protein coding parts of a gene) in the genome, with the goal of identifying the genetic cause of a specific disease. &nbsp;</p>
<h4>Candidate Gene Studies</h4>
<p>A candidate gene is a gene suspected to be involved with a particular disease, condition, or abnormality, based on previous findings. Candidate gene studies test an identified gene and mutation in a group of subjects both with the disease (cases) and without the disease (controls).</p>
<h4>Statistical Methods</h4>
<p>DCEG investigators collaborate with scientists at the <a href="http://cgf.nci.nih.gov/">Cancer Genomics Research (CGR) Laboratory</a> (formerly the Core Genotyping Facility) to formulate design and analysis strategies in support of genetic association. Such strategies include determining the number of SNPs to be followed in various stages of multistage GWAS; choosing association test statistics; analyzing and adjusting for population stratification using principal component methods; conducting haplotype-based association scans; and exploring genetic pathways and interactions.</p>
<p>In addition, investigators have developed a number of tools and resources that are made available to the general scientific public for download and use. For example, Biostatistics Branch investigators have developed a number of <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=5&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302528" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7271313" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302528" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302528">genetic analysis software tools</a>.</p>

<p>Metabolomics is the study of small-molecule metabolites in cells, tissues, and organisms that are present in biofluids such as plasma and urine.&nbsp;An emerging field of study, metabolomics has the potential to improve exposure measures and delineate mechanistic links between exposures and cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DCEG investigators launched the DCEG Metabolomics Initiative in 2011 to pilot the available technologies and evaluate their potential use in etiologic studies. &nbsp;In studying the metabolomics of energy balance, nutritional status, and cancer, they uncovered biomarkers for body mass index, diet, and smoking, along with associations between smoking-related metabolites and colorectal cancer. DCEG is now collaborating with investigators from Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center and Shanghai Cancer Institute to conduct a large study of the metabolomic risk factors for breast cancer in Shanghai women and a replication study in PLCO, with other studies in planning.</p>

<h2>A Study of Intraprostatic and Circulating Sex Steroid Hormones</h2>
<p>DCEG investigators are conducting a study to investigate to what extent blood (circulating) concentrations of sex hormones represent concentrations within the prostate. A total of 260 subjects, including African Americans and European Americans, diagnosed with prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia, or bladder cancer and undergoing prostatectomy were recruited for tissue and blood collection. Hormone levels in prostatic tissue are being measured and compared with serum levels and polymorphisms of hormone-related genes. Levels of androgen receptor and its associated proteins in prostate tissue are being measured directly. In addition, factors such as age, smoking, and body size that might alter serum-tissue correlations are being examined.</p>

<p>The microbiome refers to the collection of all of the gene sequences from a community of microbes in the human body. High-throughput DNA amplification and sequencing technologies to characterize the microbial communities provide data for investigations of microbial associations with human disease. Our goal is to establish cohorts with fecal and oral specimens to prospectively evaluate the association between the human microbiome and cancer risk.</p>
<p>While microbiome research has grown exponentially over the past several years, findings have been difficult to reproduce across studies. The variability induced by sample collection and handling has not been systematically assessed. DCEG investigators are pursuing a multi-pronged approach to address microbiome methodologic issues.</p>
<h3><a id="Methods-Development"></a>Methods Development</h3>
<p><strong>Sample collection</strong>: DCEG investigators are evaluating and standardizing fecal and oral sample collection protocols to reliably measure the human microbiome in the context of large-scale population studies. Several issues are being considered, such as, preservation of a microbial signature, stability of samples under field conditions, and preservation of samples to maximize multi &lsquo;omics assays.</p>
<p><strong>Standard reference materials</strong>: It is crucial to develop appropriate standard reference materials for quality control of samples in large epidemiologic studies. DCEG investigators have developed two types of standards, chemostat produced in an artificial gut system, also called a &ldquo;Robogut,&rdquo; and artificial communities with known bacterial mixtures. Negative controls are equally critical; the need to include them in studies is also being evaluated.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.mbqc.org/">Microbiome Quality Control (MBQC) project</a>: The degree of standardization in microbiome measurement necessary for translation to large-scale studies is early in its development. Sources of variation in microbial profiling must be evaluated and optimized so that independent epidemiologic studies can be pooled. DCEG investigators helped coordinate and conduct the MBQC study, a collaborative effort designed to comprehensively evaluate methods for measuring the human microbiome. The MBQC study evaluated the impact of various DNA extraction, sequencing, and bioinformatics methods for fecal samples.</p>
<p><strong>Feasibility of setting up cohort studies</strong>: Large, prospective, population-based cohorts are well suited to address numerous important epidemiologic questions about the pathophysiology of human diseases. Given the growing understanding of the role of human microbiome in diverse health conditions, it is imperative to implement an appropriate sample collection strategy. DCEG investigators are conducting numerous feasibility studies to evaluate whether fecal and oral samples can be collected in existing cohorts, prepaid health plans, or screening populations.</p>
<h3><a id="Etiologic-Studies"></a>Etiologic Studies</h3>
<p><strong>Prospective study of the oral microbiome and cancer</strong>: Poor oral health and periodontal pathogens have been associated with a number of cancers, mortality, and other chronic diseases, which suggests a role for the oral microbiome in the development of these conditions. DCEG investigators are assessing the association between the oral microbiome and incident cancers of the bronchus/lung, colorectum, esophagus, head/neck, hepatobiliary tract, pancreas, small intestine and stomach, using a case-cohort design within a number of existing cohorts. This multi-cancer, multi-cohort project will allow us to test several hypotheses simultaneously, provide greater insight into the role of the oral microbiome in cancer at several sites, and allow us to evaluate common mechanisms across cancer sites.</p>
<p><strong>Lower gastrointestinal cancer studies</strong>: The association between the human gut microbiome and colorectal cancer (CRC) is an important focus of our research. In a case-control study with data and fecal specimens previously collected in DCEG, we found that CRC cases had reduced fecal microbiome alpha diversity, increased carriage of <em>Fusobacterium</em> and <em>Porphyromonas</em> taxa, and reduced abundance of <em>Clostridia</em> taxa. Metabolomic analysis of the same specimens uncovered 41 small molecules that differed between cases and controls, providing potentially improved diagnostic methods or insights on carcinogenesis. Metagenome analyses of associations with CRC and with fecal metabolites corroborated the 16S analyses.</p>
<p><strong>Upper gastrointestinal cancer studies</strong>: Gastric cancer is currently the model of bacterially associated cancer; <em>Helicobacter pylori</em> has been classified as carcinogenetic in humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer. Research within DCEG has evaluated how risk factors for cancer, such as tobacco, body mass index, and pepsinogen levels, are associated with microbial diversity using samples collected in China. We found that among participants with esophageal squamous dysplasia, participants at greater risk for gastric cancer (low pepsinogen I/II ratio) had lower microbial richness than those at lower risk for gastric cancer. Associations were also detected with smoking history and body mass index in these samples. Ongoing studies are being conducted to further evaluate the impact of the oral microbiome on upper gastrointestinal cancer risk.</p>

<p>U.S. blacks are at greater risk for these diseases than whites. The NCI and collaborators in New Jersey, Detroit, and Atlanta carried out a large-scale investigation to identify risk factors for these diseases among blacks and whites resident in these areas. Data have been collected from more than 2,000 cases (multiple myeloma, 587; pancreas 527; prostate, 1,000) and 2,100 controls approximately equally divided between blacks and whites. Investigators have studied the roles of potential risk factors including occupational exposures, tobacco, alcohol, dietary and nutritional factors, viruses, medical conditions, and socioeconomic status.</p>

<p>Cancer risk is substantially elevated among solid organ transplant recipients, who receive long-term immunosuppressant medications to prevent organ rejection. To better understand the etiology of cancer in this population, investigators are conducting the <a href="http://transplantmatch.cancer.gov/">Transplant Cancer Match Study</a>. This study is a collaborative effort with the Health Resources and Services Administration, which oversees the U.S. solid organ transplant network. Data from multiple state and regional cancer registries are linked with the U.S. registry of transplant recipients, to cover&nbsp;more than&nbsp;50% of the U.S. transplant population.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Goals of the project include: 1) description of the spectrum of cancer risk in solid organ transplant recipients; 2) elucidation of the role of oncogenic viruses in causing cancer in this setting; and 3) understanding the role of other factors in causing cancer, such as demographic factors, medical conditions, and specific immunosuppressive medication.</p>

<p>A cohort is a defined population observed over time, either prospectively or retrospectively.&nbsp;In some cohorts, members share a characteristic such as an occupational exposure or medical condition, while some other cohorts are samples of the general population. In addition, some DCEG cohorts were first enrolled in clinical or prevention trials, but continue to be followed as a general population cohort.</p>
<p>Cohort members are often surveyed to gather information on lifestyle factors such as diet and nutrition, exercise, use of alcohol or tobacco, because these factors can be related to cancer risk. They are followed over time to gather updates on their general health.&nbsp;In addition, in some studies, members agree to donate biospecimens such as blood, buccal cell, and urine.</p>
<p>For cancer studies that require large numbers of subjects and biospecimens, DCEG investigators often participate in large consortia (collaborative partnerships) that pool data and biospecimens across numerous cohorts. For example, the <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/cohort.html">NCI Cohort Consortium</a> includes investigators responsible for more than 40 high-quality cohorts, involving more than 4 million people.</p>

<p>The study&nbsp;is a collaborative project of the National Cancer Institute, the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.</p>
<p>Since it began in 1993, the study has included three cohort-wide interviews to obtain information on agricultural practices and pesticide use, other occupational exposures, lifestyle factors, diseases and medication use, and one cohort-wide interview focused primarily on updating information on non-cancer health outcomes. Cancer incidence has been ascertained via linkage to population-based cancer registries in the study states, and mortality through linkage to state mortality registries and the National Death Index. Mouth rinse samples including buccal cell DNA, were collected from 39 percent of the cohort.</p>
<p>In addition, there have been a number of targeted sub-studies, focused on specific scientific questions. These studies include information on pesticide exposure monitoring from a sample of farms and the collection of a variety of biologic tissues from selected samples of participants. Collaborative ventures with extramural investigators are encouraged.</p>

<p>The Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study conducted in southwestern Finland has been an integral cohort research resource for NCI for nearly three decades. The study was designed to test hypotheses based on epidemiological and experimental evidence supporting nutritional prevention of cancer, including lower risk among persons with higher vitamin status and vegetable consumption, and the biological and anti-neoplastic properties of several antioxidants and micronutrients. It tested supplementation with &beta;-carotene (20 mg/day) and vitamin E (50 mg/day, as dl-&alpha;-tocopheryl acetate) for five-eight years (1985-1993) in 29,133 male smokers (&gt;5 cigarettes daily), and found 8% higher overall mortality and 18% increased lung cancer incidence in the &beta;-carotene arm, and 32% lower prostate cancer incidence in the men supplemented with vitamin E.</p>
<p>Baseline questionnaire data and biospecimens (serum, whole blood, and toenail clippings) were collected, and fasting serum &alpha;-tocopherol, &beta;-carotene, retinol, and HDL/total cholesterol were measured for the entire cohort. Ongoing linkage with the Finnish Cancer and Mortality Registries has provided complete case ascertainment and causes of death.</p>
<p>The high-quality study data, biological specimens, and ongoing endpoint ascertainment have tested biochemical/molecular and genetic hypotheses with respect to cancers of the lung (4,171 cases currently), prostate (n=2,874), colorectum (979), bladder (871), upper gastrointestinal tract (640), pancreas (488), and kidney (391), and lymphomas/ leukemias (639). The ATBC study collaborates with extramural researchers and participates in a large number of international consortium projects such as BPC3, the Dietary Pooling Project, COMETS, EHPCCG, PRACTICAL, GAME-ON, PanScan, LC3, TRICL, GECCO, CORECT, Interlymph, and other NCI Cohort Consortium analyses.</p>

<p>The HPV Vaccine Trial in Costa Rica is a collaboration between investigators in Costa Rica and the National Cancer Institute. The trial was designed as a blinded, randomized, phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a bivalent HPV-16/18 virus-like particle (VLP) vaccine. The vaccine used in the trial was developed by investigators at NCI and other research institutions and is manufactured by GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals. The trial was initiated on June 28, 2004 and enrollment was completed on December 22, 2005; there were 7,466 women enrolled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trial staff followed all enrolled women for a period of four years. Women who were eligible, consented, and were randomized into the trial received three doses of the HPV-16/18 VLP or Havrix (Hepatitis A) vaccine over a period of six months. At entry and throughout follow-up, women were carefully monitored and received state-of-the-art screening for cervical neoplasia.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This study was designed to evaluate vaccine efficacy, immunological correlates of long-term vaccine success and failure, and other factors of immunological and etiological interest. Extension of follow-up for up to ten years is now underway to assess the duration of protection and long-term effects of vaccination. Data from the trial demonstrated that three doses of the HPV vaccine may not be necessary, as similar vaccine efficacy against cervical HPV-16/18 infection was observed among women who received two, and even a single dose, of the HPV vaccine after four years of follow-up.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Women's Health Study (SWHS), a collaborative study by NCI, Vanderbilt University, and the Shanghai Cancer Institute, is a prospective cohort study of approximately 75,000 Chinese women who were recruited between 1997 and 2000. Members of the cohort have been followed through multiple in-person interviews to obtain information on diet, occupational and environmental exposures, and various lifestyle factors. Information from the follow-ups is linked to vital records and the tumor registry to obtain information on disease.</p>
<p>Special characteristics of the cohort include the following:&nbsp;It is a population-based sample with very high response rates; it is composed of almost entirely never-smokers; and it uses a detailed exposure database that includes tens of thousands of workplace measurements collected over many decades in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Over the years, data and biological samples (blood/buccal cell and urine) collected in the SWHS have been used to evaluate many important etiologic hypotheses and support multiple studies. Most recently, nested case-control molecular epidemiology studies and occupational exposure analyses of lung cancer, brain cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma have been conducted.</p>

<p>PLCO is a large NCI trial (<em>n</em>=155,000) that evaluated screening for early detection of prostate, lung, colon, and ovarian cancer. In addition to these aims, it is widely used as an observational cohort for early detection and etiologic studies.</p>
<p>Starting in 1993, participants were randomized in equal proportions to an intervention arm (<em>n</em>=77,500), which received trial screening, or to a control arm (<em>n</em>=77,500), which received usual care. Intervention arm participants provided annual blood samples for six years, whereas control arm participants provided a single oral wash sample. All participants have been followed for cancer incidence and mortality since enrollment in 1993.</p>
<p>The large size of this cohort and availability of serial samples make PLCO a unique and widely used resource for etiologic and early detection studies. More than 250 projects have been approved to use the biological resources in the cohort so far, as have more than 250 data-only projects. PLCO participates in more than 30 consortia and has resulted in more than 1000 publications to date. Highlights include playing a key role in the discovery of nearly three-quarters of the known genomic susceptibility loci for cancer identified in genome-wide association studies; studies of acquired mutations; and studies of obesity and physical activity.</p>

<p>Cancer is a complex disease driven by numerous factors: environment, lifestyle, and genetic make-up. In some cases, genetic variation shared within families is related to risk for disease. For over three decades, NCI scientists have studied families in which multiple individuals have developed specific cancers. This research, now aided by new genomic technologies, has led to the discovery of genes and environmental exposures that affect cancer risk in families and the general population.</p>

<h3>Unraveling Genetic Susceptibility to Melanoma</h3>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p></p>
<p>Most genetic epidemiology investigations evaluate the contributions of host susceptibility and environmental exposure in the development of cancer. In family studies, the host susceptibility measure is frequently an alteration in specific gene(s). These studies tend to be very long term with varying activity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although two genes associated with melanoma susceptibility have been identified (<i>CDKN2A</i> and <i>CDK4</i>), alterations in these genes are found in only a small percentage of melanoma-prone families. The search for other genes continues. In collaboration with GenoMEL (Melanoma Genetics Consortium), an international consortium, DCEG investigators are searching for new melanoma susceptibility genes both within families and a genome-wide association study. In a methodologic study, investigators compared <i>CDKN2A</i> mutation detection using denaturing high performance liquid chromatography to usual screening across nine different centers in GenoMEL. They found that mutation detection across the groups was consistent and of high quality.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators have also conducted an association study of familial melanoma using a candidate gene approach, and analysis is continuing. &nbsp;They continue to accrue and evaluate new families while continuing to evaluate families of individuals with heritable retinoblastoma and melanoma.</p>

<p>Bone density has emerged as a potentially important predictor of risk for certain cancers that are influenced by hormones, such as breast and endometrial cancers. In 1992, over 25,000 postmenopausal women volunteered for FIT, a clinical trial to determine whether the drug alendronate could reduce the incidence of osteoporosis fractures. The BFIT study is a retrospective cohort study that uses data from the FIT clinical trial to evaluate how bone mineral density of the hip is related to subsequent cancer risk; including a nested case-cohort study of circulating sex steroid hormones in relation to breast, endometrial, ovarian, and colorectal cancer risk.</p>
<p>NCI and FIT investigators contacted FIT volunteers to identify incident cancers, and to evaluate whether risk factor information collected in 1992, such as measured bone mineral density, lifestyle factors, and certain growth factors, predicts subsequent cancer risk. Collection of additional risk factor information during this follow-up, including updated lifestyle factors and a buccal cell sample for genetic analyses, is allowing investigators to further explore the complex relationships between bone mass and other risk factors for breast, endometrial, and other cancers. Currently underway are efforts to understand associations between androgens and androgen metabolites as well as progesterone-related metabolites and breast cancer risk and the interrelationships between bone mass and endogenous hormones and risk of breast, endometrial, and other cancers.</p>
<h3>Serum Estrogen Metabolites and Cancer Risk in the BFIT Study</h3>
<p>Although circulating estrogens have been evaluated in prior epidemiological studies of cancer, numerous questions remain with regard to the role of estrogen metabolites in the development of hormone-related cancers. Investigators conducted a case-cohort study within BFIT to examine circulating estrogens and estrogen metabolites in relation to four specific cancer endpoints. Women who were screened for participation in the trial completed a risk factor questionnaire, provided a baseline blood sample and underwent a bone mineral density scan. As part of the BFIT study, these women were followed (median 10.3 years) to ascertain incident cancer outcomes and incident fractures through the period of 2001-2004.</p>
<p>A comprehensive profile of endogenous estrogens, including 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites, were measured in pre-diagnostic serum using the LC-MS/MS assay developed at the Protein Characterization Laboratory at the Frederick National Cancer Center. These measures were examined in relation to breast (n~420), endometrial (n~62), ovarian (n~65), and colorectal (n~178) cancers. Elevated circulating estradiol levels were found associated with increased breast cancer risk. &nbsp;Further, elevated levels of metabolites in the 2- and 4-hydroxylation pathways to parent estrogens were inversely related to risk. A higher ratio of the 2/16-hydroxylation pathway was also associated with reduced risk. Elevated estradiol levels were also related to increases in endometrial cancer risk, without meaningful associations with individual metabolites. In contrast, neither parent estrogens nor metabolites were found to be related to either ovarian or colorectal cancer risks.</p>
<h3>Adipocytokines and Endometrial Cancer Risk in the BFIT Study</h3>
<p>Obesity is a well-established risk factor for endometrial cancer and may independently affect endometrial cancer risk, even after adjustment for sex steroids. Adipose tissue produces several adipocytokines, including leptin and adiponectin, and although few studies have assessed these markers in relation to endometrial cancer risk, the majority of studies have utilized post-diagnostic blood samples. Investigators are currently conducting a nested case-control study to examine circulating pre-diagnostic levels of adiponectin, high molecular weight adiponectin, leptin, and C-peptide in relation to endometrial cancer risk among a subset of postmenopausal women (~60 cases/120 controls) in the BFIT follow-up study. Within this study, investigators will also be able to evaluate a full panel of circulating estrogens and estrogen metabolites as well as investigate relationships with obesity metrics such as body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Infertility has long been recognized as a risk factor for various cancers, including breast and gynecologic cancers. More recently, concern has been raised regarding effects of drugs used to treat infertility, particularly since these drugs stimulate ovulation and raise endogenous estrogen levels. Investigators in DCEG have been involved with a number of investigations to clarify effects of fertility drug exposures on risk of various cancers.</p>
<p>One of these investigations involved a retrospective cohort study that identified 12,193 women who had been evaluated and/or treated for infertility at five large reproductive endocrinology practices between the early 1960&rsquo;s and 1989.&nbsp;Detailed information was abstracted from medical records, and located patients were administered questionnaires to obtain updated information regarding disease risk factors and health status. Linkages were also performed with thirteen cancer registries and the National Death Index. The latest follow-up, which assessed cancer incidence through 2010, revealed 749 breast, 118 endometrial and 85 ovarian cancer cases, and allowed a detailed assessment of risk in relation to both clomiphene and gonadotropins.</p>
<p>Results regarding effects of ovulation-stimulating drugs on endometrial and ovarian&nbsp;cancers were largely reassuring.&nbsp;The only significant excess risk was that of ovarian cancer associated with clomiphene exposures among women who remained nulligravid during follow-up. This most likely reflected that these women had more resistant infertility rather than an effect of the drug exposures. For medically validated invasive breast cancers, however, there was a significantly elevated risk observed for women who received 12 or more clomiphene cycles&mdash;a dosage much higher than would be prescribed in current practice.&nbsp;The excess risk was highest among women who remained nulligravid during follow-up. This also leads to questions regarding the biologic plausibility of the association. Nonetheless, the results do support the need for continued monitoring of risks, particularly given the relatively young age of women in this cohort (average age at follow-up was only 50 years of age). &nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to evaluating effects of older fertility drugs, more recently prescribed fertility treatments have been of interest, including those associated with <i>in vitro</i> fertilization (IVF). For such analyses, collaborations have been established in both Israel and Norway, given that these countries both have very high rates of such procedures. Two record linkage efforts have been undertaken, one at Maccabi Healthcare Services, the second largest health maintenance organization in Israel, and the other among a cohort of parous women in Norway. The Israeli study showed generally reassuring results regarding IVF exposures for most cancers, with the only evidence of any risk elevation being a non-significant risk for ovarian cancer among women receiving 4 or more IVF cycles.&nbsp;In contrast, the risk among women receiving IVF of <i>in situ</i> cervical cancer was significantly reduced and that of invasive cervical cancer non-significantly reduced&mdash;most likely reflecting more intensive Pap smear screening among women seeking IVF. In contrast to the Israeli study, results from Norway suggested increasing risks of breast cancer among the women followed for the longest periods of time. These results support the need for continued follow-up to fully clarify long-term cancer risks associated with IVF exposures.</p>

After they have contacted us to ask about this study, if they are interested in learning more about it, we will send them a letter that describes the study in more detail. We will then telephone them to determine whether they wish to participate in the research. If they decide to participate, we will mail a package to their home that contains all of the materials needed for the study. The package includes the study consent form, the personal and family medical history questionnaire, and the kit that contains a special plastic cup and a lid for using to collect a saliva sample. After they have signed the consent form, completed the questionnaire and collected the saliva sample, they can mail these back to us in a pre-addressed postage-paid envelope included in the package.</p>
<p>We will provide participants with the overall findings of the study when analysis of information from the study is completed.</p>
<p>Based on information we learn about a participant&rsquo;s personal or family medical history or from the laboratory tests done on DNA from the saliva or chordoma samples, we may re-contact a participant and invite him/her, and possibly some close relatives, to participate in a separate clinical study related to the development of chordoma. If we re-contact people about the clinical study, they can decide at that time whether they want to participate in it.</p>

<p>A series of DCEG occupational and molecular epidemiology studies on benzene exposure in Chinese workers, part of a twenty-year collaboration with the China CDC, led to a seminal report which provided the first direct evidence in humans that benzene harms the progenitor cells that give rise to blood cells, and that benzene causes hematologic effects at or below 1 ppm, particularly among susceptible subpopulations. These findings informed a pivotal 2007 EPA ruling limiting the benzene content in gasoline and adopting controls on passenger vehicles and portable fuel containers in order to significantly reduce emissions of hazardous air pollutants. More recently, the National Research Council of the National Academies recommended, based primarily on the NCI-CDC findings, that the 90 day exposure standard for benzene air levels in U.S. Navy submarines be reduced from 1.0 to 0.2 ppm.</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>The carcinogenicity of diesel exhaust in humans has remained unclear despite 35 previous studies that investigated lung cancer risk in relation to diesel engine exhaust.</p>
<h3>Advance</h3>
<p>In 1992, researchers led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=28&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349599" sys_contentid="349599" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1965" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7274591" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349599" rxinlineslot="103">Debra T. Silverman, Sc.D.,</a> and colleagues at the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health launched a study designed to clarify the relationship between exposure to diesel engine exhaust and the risk of death from lung cancer. &nbsp;The study is the first to show a statistically significant exposure-response of increasing lung cancer risk associated with increasing exposure to diesel exhaust based on quantitative estimates of workers&rsquo; exposure, after adjusting for other lung cancer risk factors including cigarette smoking</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>The broad range of diesel exposure in this study allowed researchers to estimate lung cancer risk for heavily exposed workers, as well as those exposed to low levels of diesel exhaust. The new findings are important not just for miners, but also for the 12 million American workers and tens of millions more worldwide who are exposed to diesel exhaust in the workplace and for people who live in cities with high levels of diesel exhaust, the study authors noted.</p>
<p>In June 2012, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), part of the World Health Organization, classified diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic to humans (a group 1 carcinogen). The decision was based on an IARC working group&rsquo;s opinion that the body of evidence supports an association between diesel exhaust exposure and an increased risk of lung cancer. The classification was based on results from several large human studies. The Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study played a pivotal role in the IARC evaluation.</p>

<p>More than 20 years of epidemiologic research by DCEG investigators has helped to establish the central causal role of carcinogenic genotypes of human papillomavirus (HPV) in the development of virtually all cases of cervical cancer. NCI&rsquo;s natural history studies have shown that it is persistent HPV infection, and not the infection itself, that increases the risk of developing cervical cancer. This finding led to the creation and adoption of new screening guidelines by the American Cancer Society and the Association of Clinical Obstetricians and Gynecologists. &nbsp;</p>
<p>NCI scientists also developed and validated HPV DNA testing that directly assays the causal virus. Now in widespread use in the U.S., the test provides greater accuracy than ambiguous Pap smears, and has led to improved clinical management strategies, with lengthened screening intervals. In addition, NCI scientists invented the virus-like particle technology that enabled the development of HPV vaccines to prevent infection and resultant cancer. &nbsp;An NCI-sponsored Phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a vaccine against HPV types 16 and 18 has shown near complete protection against new infections and precancerous lesions. As a result of NCI research, the U.S. strategy for the prevention of cervical cancer has been transformed from reliance on untargeted, frequent, and lifelong repetition of Pap smears to a combination of vaccination and targeted HPV-based screening. &nbsp;</p>

<p>The "Pesticide-exposure Matrix" was developed to help epidemiologists and other researchers identify the active ingredients to which people were likely exposed when their homes and gardens were treated for pests in past years. Its derivation is described in full in Colt J, Cyr MJ, Zahm SH, Tobias GS, Hartge P. 2006. <a href="http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/info:doi/10.1289/ehp.9538">Inferring past pesticide-exposures: a matrix of individual active ingredients in home and garden pesticides used in past decades</a>. <i>Environmental Health Perspective</i> (epub).</p>
<p>The matrix is designed to be used in conjunction with self-reported information about the types of pests that were treated in a person's home or garden. (<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1500&amp;sys_contentid=327412" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="327412" sys_dependentvariantid="1500" sys_relationshipid="7296171" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1500" sys_contentid="327412">Example questionnaire</a>)</p>
<p>The matrix covers four distinct time periods (1976, 1980, 1990, and 2000), two categories of pesticide appliers (consumers, using products purchased in retail stores, and professional applicators such as pest control operators and lawn services), and 12 types of pests:</p>
<ul>
<li>lawn insects</li>
<li>lawn weeds</li>
<li>outdoor plant/tree insects</li>
<li>outdoor plant/tree weeds</li>
<li>outdoor plant/tree diseases</li>
<li>insects on indoor plants</li>
<li>crawling insects in/around the home</li>
<li>flying insects in/around the home</li>
<li>termites in/around the home</li>
<li>fleas/ticks on pets</li>
<li>fleas/ticks in/around the home</li>
<li>rodents</li>

For each scenario, the matrix lists the active ingredients that were on the market and provides a rough estimate of the probability that a product containing each ingredient was used. The probabilities are unrelated to the concentrations of the active ingredients in the product. The matrix does not cover synergists, repellents, solvents, emulsifiers, spreaders, stickers, buffering agents, or other ingredients that are not considered active ingredients but must be listed on the label.</p>

The data are typically used for market planning purposes in developing business strategies focused on the consumer and professional markets. The types of information presented in the reports vary, depending on the type of market (consumer versus professional), the pest type, and the year (data have become more detailed with time).

A related resource is the Pesticide Product Label System (PPLS), a collection of pesticide label images. Another information source was the U.S. EPA National Home and Garden Pesticide Use Survey (the &ldquo;<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=7&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303781#whitmore" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303781" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7296189" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303781#whitmore">U.S. EPA Survey</a>&rdquo;).

<p>We used several different methods to develop the active ingredient lists and estimate the probabilities. Our choice of a method for each scenario was based on the types and quality of information available. Professional judgment played a large role in many scenarios. Our level of confidence varies by scenario, depending on the type of method used, the extent to which judgment played a role, the quality of the data in the source materials, and other factors.</p>
<p>The methods used for deriving the active ingredient lists and probabilities are summarized here. Additional detail is provided in Colt J, Cyr MJ, Zahm SH, Tobias GS, Hartge P. 2006. <a href="http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/info:doi/10.1289/ehp.9538">Inferring past pesticide-exposures: a matrix of individual active ingredients in home and garden pesticides used in past decades</a>. <i>Environmental Health Perspectives</i> (epub).</p>
<p>The scenarios to which each method applies, and the confidence level in the probability estimates for each scenario, can be found in the &ldquo;<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1500&amp;sys_contentid=316842" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="316842" sys_dependentvariantid="1500" sys_relationshipid="7296182" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1500" sys_contentid="316842">Pesticide-Exposure Matrix</a>&rdquo; PDF file.</p>
<h3>Method 1: Number of Acres Treated</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">This method was used when the Kline reports provided the number of acres nationwide treated with specific pesticide products. We assumed that the probability that a product (and each active ingredient in it) was used is equal to the percent of acres treated with that product.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">We have a medium confidence level in the estimates for outdoor plant/tree insects (1990, 2000) and a high confidence level for the others. This is because the Kline data for outdoor plants do not include mature trees, which are often sprayed with insecticides by professional applicators. This use might be significant but is likely smaller than the market for insecticides applied to gardens and landscaping areas, upon which the Kline estimates are based. We do not believe this to be an important limitation for outdoor plant/tree pests other than insects.</p>
<h3>Method 2: Number of Acres Treated&nbsp;<br />(Derived from Pounds of Active Ingredients and Application Rates)</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">This method was used for lawns and outdoor plants/trees when Kline reported the pounds of individual active ingredients sold. We divided the pounds of each active ingredient by an estimated application rate (pounds/acre) to derive the number of acres treated with each active ingredient, and then proceeded as in Method 1.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">Judgment was used for all of these scenarios and we have a medium level of confidence in the probability estimates. For lawn weeds (1980, 1990, 2000), we modified the Kline-reported pounds of some active ingredients to reflect our judgment about actual product formulations. For lawn and outdoor plant/tree insects (1980, 1990, 2000), Kline provided the active ingredient pounds aggregated across three pest types (lawn insects, outdoor plant insects, and non-plant insects), requiring us to allocate the pounds to each individual pest type. A similar situation was encountered for outdoor plant/tree diseases (1980, 1990, 2000).</p>
<h3>Method 3: Number of Acres Treated&nbsp;<br />(Derived from Dollar Sales, Unit Prices, and Application Rates)</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">This approach was used when Kline reported both dollar sales and unit prices (dollars per pound or gallon) for individual products. We divided the dollar sales by the unit price to estimate the pounds or gallons of each product sold. We then divided the pounds or gallons sold by an estimated application rate (pounds or gallons per acre) to derive the number of outdoor plant/tree acres treated with each product, and proceeded as in Method 1. We have a medium level of confidence in the probability estimates.</p>
<h3>Method 4: Product Sales</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">We used this method when Kline reported dollar sales for individual products or active ingredients, but not unit prices. We assumed that the probability that a product (and each active ingredient in it) was used is equal to the product&rsquo;s proportion of total dollar sales.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">Because of the uncertainty associated with using product sales as the basis for probability of use, we have a medium confidence level in the probabilities for most of these scenarios. We gave high confidence ratings to the 1990 and 2000 professional termite scenarios, the former because the market was well understood by Kline and the latter because of the large sample size used by Kline. The consumer rodent market was rated high because it has been dominated by d-Con during the entire period of interest, and the professional segment was high because it has used a small number of active ingredients in a well-documented market. Our confidence level is low for professional treatment of outdoor plant/tree insects in 1976 and 1980 because the Kline data excluded insecticide applications to mature trees, and because the 1976 data were aggregated across more than one pest type. We have low confidence in the probabilities for flying insects in 2000 because they were based only on bees.</p>
<h3>Method 5: Product Sales<br />(Calculated from Company Sales)</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">This method was used when Kline reported dollar sales by manufacturer (but not by product or active ingredient) and identified each manufacturer&rsquo;s main products and (typically) each product&rsquo;s main active ingredients, but did not provide unit prices. We identified the active ingredients in each product when necessary. We apportioned each manufacturer&rsquo;s dollar sales to its individual products or active ingredients using judgment. We assumed that the probability that a product (and each active ingredient in it) was used is equal to the product&rsquo;s percent of total dollar sales.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">For indoor plants in 1990, Kline reported sales by manufacturer and we used the U.S. EPA PPIS to identify the active ingredients that each manufacturer might have used. Probabilities for indoor plants pertain to insects only.</p>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">Our confidence level is medium for all scenarios except lawn weeds (1976) and outdoor plant/tree weeds (1976), which are rated low because our allocation of sales to active ingredients required more judgment than the other scenarios.</p>
<h3>Method 6: Active Ingredient Frequencies from Pesticide Product Information System (PPIS)</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">For consumer treatment of household insects, the Kline reports were not sufficiently detailed for our purposes. Therefore, for scenarios 25-40, we used data from the U.S. EPA PPIS and the U.S. EPA Survey to estimate the active ingredient probabilities. This approach is described in detail in Colt J, Cyr MJ, Zahm SH, Tobias GS, Hartge P. 2006. <a href="http://ehp03.niehs.nih.gov/article/info:doi/10.1289/ehp.9538">Inferring past pesticide-exposures: a matrix of individual active ingredients in home and garden pesticides used in past decades</a>. <i>Environmental Health Perspectives</i> (epub). We have a medium level of confidence in the probability estimates.</p>
<h3>Method 7: Professional Judgment Based on Descriptive Data</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">Here, probabilities were based mostly on judgment, sometimes with a small amount of quantitative and/or descriptive data in the Kline reports, the literature, and the U.S. EPA PPLS . For indoor plants, the estimates pertain to treatment of insects only. Our confidence level is low.</p>
<h3>Method 8: Active Ingredients Listed, Probabilities Not Estimated</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">For some scenarios, Kline does not maintain data and there was not enough information from other sources to support a probability estimate. Therefore, we developed lists of likely active ingredients but did not estimate probabilities. The lists were based on information from the Kline reports, the U.S. EPA PPLS, selected information from the literature, and judgment.</p>
<h3>Method 9: No Active Ingredients Listed or Probabilities Estimated</h3>
<p style="margin-left: 20.0px;">We were unable to list active ingredients or estimate probabilities for consumer treatment of termites and professional treatment of indoor plants. There is no evidence that a significant number of consumers purchased products to self-apply termiticides until the late 1990s, and the market remains extremely small. Indoor plants are rarely treated by professional applicators.</p>

<h4>About the reviewed questionnaires:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The questionnaires share the following characteristics. They are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Designed to address covariates (confounding) exposures, not main variables or the principal subject of a study, which might require more detailed questions</p>
<p>&bull; Developed primarily for use in cohort studies, rather than case-control studies, which often require more questions about lifetime and historic, rather than current, exposures&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Predicated on English-speaking literate adult respondents, not special populations&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Designed to be self-explanatory, assuming that the questionnaire will be self-administered, not by interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In questionnaire development, there is often a choice between open-ended and categorical questions. We included open-ended questions only when responses were likely to be both easily remembered by the participant and straightforward to analyze.&nbsp;</p>

<h4>About the reviewed questionnaires:&nbsp;</h4>
<p>The questionnaires share the following characteristics. They are:&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Designed to address covariates (confounding) exposures, not main variables or the principal subject of a study, which might require more detailed questions</p>
<p>&bull; Developed primarily for use in cohort studies, rather than case-control studies, which often require more questions about lifetime and historic, rather than current, exposures&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Predicated on English-speaking literate adult respondents, not special populations&nbsp;</p>
<p>&bull; Designed to be self-explanatory, assuming that the questionnaire will be self-administered, not by interview.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In questionnaire development, there is often a choice between open-ended and categorical questions. We included open-ended questions only when responses were likely to be both easily remembered by the participant and straightforward to analyze.&nbsp;</p>

<p>*******************************************************************************************<br />** SegCNV<br />**<br />**<br />** 2011-1-18<br />*******************************************************************************************</p>
<p>### Introduction<br />SegCNV is a software package, implemented in C++, to detect germline copy number variations in SNP array data.<br />Currently, SegCNV supports Illumina 550K and 610K &nbsp;genotyping platforms. We are working to include more platforms.</p>
<p>## Installation</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the precompiled binary program segcnv works in in your platform, then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Create a work folder WORK, copy the binary file segcnv to WORK;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Copy folder configuration (and all files in the folder) to WORK.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the precompiled binary program segcnv does not work in your platform, please run &nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"g++ Single.Seg.CNV.cpp -o segcnv" to generate executable segcnv file and then copy<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it to the folder WORK.</p>
<p>## &nbsp;Usage</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Preprocessing of the intensity file:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We strongly encourage you to remove the wave effect correlated with the GC content first.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Data format:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each intensity file (for one subject) has three columns: probe name, BAF and LRR.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We use one example to illustrate the usage of segcnv. We call CNVs of ten Hapmap samples genotyped using 550K platform.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run the program, type &nbsp;&nbsp;"./segcnv --callcnv --filelist filelist --outfile outfile".<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, filelist specifies the intensity file names and its subject ID. In this example, filelist file is:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA06991.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA06991<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA06993.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA06993<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA06994.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA06994<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA07029.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA07029<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA07345.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA07345<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA07348.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA07348<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA07357.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA07357<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA10830.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA10830<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA10835.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA10835<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;./Hapmap/NA10847.GCA &nbsp;&nbsp;NA10847</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"outfile" specifies the ourput file. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The program will search for all CNVs covered by at least 3 probes. You can run analysis in other specifications. For example:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"./segcnv --callcnv --filelist filelist --platform 1 -chrid 2 -min 5 --outfile outfile" will call CNVs covered by at least 5<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;probes, only on chromosome 2 for the data produced from the Illumina 610K platform. Here is the full explanation of the usage:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;usage: ./seg_cnv &nbsp;&lt;flags (optional)&gt;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;flags:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. Platform<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; --platform &gt; &nbsp;Currently support two platforms:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illumina.550K (Default)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Illumina.610K<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. CNV Calling<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--callcnv &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call CNV for each sample.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--filelist &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filelist with File_Name, sample_ID.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; -chrid &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call CNV on the chromosome chrid specifies. Default analyzes all 22 chromosomes.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt; -min &gt; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Min number of probes covered by the CNV. Default is 3.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3. Out File<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--outfile &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out file.</p>
<p># Output file</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The output file has 14 columns:</p>
<p>* Sample ID<br />* Chromosome ID<br />* Segment starting probe order<br />* Segment ending probe order<br />* Total probes in the segment<br />* Segment starting probe bp location<br />* Segment ending probe bp location<br />* Start probe name<br />* End probe name<br />* Copy number (0: hyterozygous deletion, 1: hemizygous deletion, 2: normal copy, 3: duplication with copy number)<br />* Score(Z score of the called segments based only on LRR.)<br />* Score(Z score of the called segments integrating both LRR and BAF for duplication segments.)<br />* Expected false positive calls per genome scan at this threshold. Smaller is more stringent and results in less calls.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Suggested value: 0.01 or 0.05. IMPORTANTLY, segcnv calls segments even with very modest evidence of CNV (|z| score &gt; 3.5).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At this threshold, most are false positives, but many are true CNVs. You choose a threshold to filter out weak candidate CNVs.</p>

<p>Assessment of occupational exposures in case-control studies has traditionally been limited because of the lack of information on the variability of exposures across and within jobs. NCI has developed special questionnaires with modules designed to obtain detailed exposure-oriented information for over 40 specific jobs and over 10 specific industries. These modules include questions on tasks, work practices, chemicals, equipment, engineering controls, personal protective equipment and indirect exposures specific to those jobs and industries.</p>
<p>Examples of jobs and industries for which questionnaires have been developed include:</p>
<h2>Job-based modules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cabinet makers</li>
<li>Carpenters</li>
<li>Janitors</li>
<li>Laborer</li>
<li>Managers</li>
<li>Machinists</li>
<li>Mechanics</li>
<li>Office professionals</li>
<li>Packagers</li>
<li>Painters</li>
<li>Plumbers</li>
<li>Production inspectors</li>
<li>Roofers</li>
<li>Steel workers</li>
<li>Welders/Cutters/Burners</li>
</ul>
<h2>Industry-based modules</h2>
<ul>
<li>Dry cleaning/Laundry industry</li>
<li>Heavy construction industry</li>
<li>Oil refining industry</li>
<li>Printing industry</li>
<li>Rubber industry</li>
<li>Shoe industry</li>

<p>appropriate sas file/sas variable names must be associated with each macro parameters<br />on the invocation of the sas macro &nbsp;"BrCa_MD_RAM".</p>
<p>For example coding &nbsp;"In_File = AARPin" &nbsp;tells the macro that the user created<br />sas file &nbsp;"AARPin" &nbsp;is to be used for input of variables. &nbsp;Similarly, coding<br />"N_Biop = Num_Biops", &nbsp;lets the macro know that the sas variable "Num_Biops" in the<br />sas input file &nbsp;"AARPin" &nbsp;contiains the count of the # of biopsies performed.</p>
<p>To involke the sas macro in your sas program, an #include statement must be coded in<br />your sas program.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>the statement: %include "BrCa_MD_RAM"; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points to the sas macro &nbsp;BrCa_MD_RAM<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stored in your current directory</p>
<p>the statement: %include "c:\sas.macro\BrCa_MD_RAM"; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points to the sas macro<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;BrCa_MD_RAM stored in the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;directory c:\sas.macro</p>

<p>After the absolute risks have been generated, descriptive statistics by applying PROC<br />MEANS to the quantities Error_Ind, AbsRsk, One_AR_RR1 and One_AR_RR2 is performed. &nbsp;When<br />the mean and standard deviation for the variable &nbsp;"Error_Ind" &nbsp;is 0, implies that no<br />errors have not been found. &nbsp;Otherwise when the mean and std for &nbsp;"Error_Ind" is not 0,<br />implies that errors have been found. &nbsp;When errors are found, the # of records with errors<br />is the count asscociated with "AbsRsk" listed under NMiss (# of missing). &nbsp;Furthermore, a<br />listing file for erroronious records follows the PROC Means output. &nbsp;For example:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10:52 Wednesday, July 15, 2009<br />BrCa_MD_RAM, &nbsp;sas macro to project for BrCa absolute risk<br />Quick check for errornous records on input file</p>
<p>IF MEAN OF &nbsp;'Error_Ind' &nbsp;&nbsp;EQUALS &nbsp;0, &nbsp;&nbsp;ERROR &nbsp;FREE. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ERROR LISTING BELOW WILL BE EMPTY.<br />IF MEAN OF &nbsp;'Error_Ind' &nbsp;&nbsp;IS NOT &nbsp;0, &nbsp;&nbsp;ERRORS EXISTS. &nbsp;CHECK ERROR LISTING BELOW.</p>
<p>(# of records with errors is the # listed under the NMiss column in the 'AbsRsk' line)</p>

<p>(e) ReadMe.fil &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this file you are reading</p>
<p>After unzipping &nbsp;"APA_BrCa_AbsRsk.zip", &nbsp;check to see that all files listed above are<br />included. &nbsp;At this point, a cursory examination of &nbsp;"APA_BrCa_RAM", &nbsp;"APA_BrCa_example.sas"<br />and "APA_RR.fil" &nbsp;will prove helpful. &nbsp;These files can be veiwed using your favorite text<br />editor or &nbsp;Notepad &nbsp;which is included with Windows.</p>
<p>Installation and operation of the sas macro &nbsp;"APA_BrCa_RAM":</p>
<p>(a) unzip the entire contentes of the zip file "APA_BrCa_RAM.zip" into a folder on<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;your hard drive.</p>
<p>(b) execute the provided demonstration sas program &nbsp;"APA_BrCa_example.sas".</p>
<p>(c) compare the output &nbsp;"APA_BrCa_example.lst" &nbsp;with the provided file<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;"APA_BrCa_example.out". &nbsp;The two files should be identical. &nbsp;If so, congratulations,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you have successfully installed the software.</p>
<p>Characteristics of the input sas file for the Asian-Pacific-American Risk Assessment SAS Macro:</p>
<p>(a) the input sas file name and output sas file name are provided by the user upon the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;invocation of the sas macro &nbsp;"APA_BrCa_RAM".</p>
<p>(b) the input sas file must contain the following 9 quantities. &nbsp;any additional variables<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on the input sas file are ignored. &nbsp;No particular ordering is required.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) ID unique ID &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(non-negative integer 1,2,3....9999999)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) current age in years in the age interval [20, 90) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. 35.8</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) projctn age in years in the age interval (current age, 90] &nbsp;e.g. 58.9<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constraint of: &nbsp;20 =&lt; current age &lt; projctn age &lt;= 90</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(4) # of breast biopsies &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(non-negative integer counts 1,2,3...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(5) age at menarche in years &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(non-negative integer years)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(6) age of first live birth in years &nbsp;(non-negative integer years)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;constraint of: &nbsp;age menarche &lt;= age at first live birth</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(7) # of first degree relatives with breast cancer<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(non-negative integer counts 1,2,3...)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(8) biopsy displays atypical hyperplasia?<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;0 &nbsp;= no<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 &nbsp;= yes<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;99 = unk or not applicable response</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF # breast biopsies = 0, &nbsp;hyperplasia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MUST BE 99 (not applicable)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;IF # breast biopsies &gt; 0, &nbsp;hyperplasia &nbsp;can be &nbsp;0,1 or 99 (unknown)</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(9) race of women<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1=Chinese &nbsp;2=Japanese &nbsp;3=Filipino 4=Hawaiian 5=Other Pacific Islander 6=Other Asian<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;for records where race is not 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5 or 6<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;projected &nbsp;abs risk &nbsp;defaults to the sas missing value "." .</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;more detailed documentation is provided in the first 350 lines of the SAS macro<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;"APA_BrCa_RAM"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;in the above [) represents an interval closed on the left and &nbsp;&nbsp;open on the right<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(] represents an interval &nbsp;&nbsp;open on the left and closed on the right</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this program will categorize the raw values of # breast biopsies, age menarche,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;age first live birth and # 1st degree relatives with brca into risk categories<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;according to the rules outlined in the JNCI 2011 manuscript listed at the beginning<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;of this document.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;note that the program, being an analytical tool, will make the most rudimentary<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;checks for logical consistency between the input variables. &nbsp;It is the user's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;responsibility to make sure that all input covariate values are logically<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;consistent and correct within each person. &nbsp;As a final step, the program<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will generate a missing projected Absolute Risk for records which it deems to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;be in error. &nbsp;The user should examine the output file for any records with a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;missing Absolute Risk and rectify the error(s) for these records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;e.g. if NBiops equals zero than atypical hyperplasia must be 99 (not applicable)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or &nbsp;Projection Age in years must be greater than Current Age</p>

<p>After unzipping the contents of &nbsp;"W_CRCAbsRsk.zip", &nbsp;check to see that all files<br />listed above are included.</p>
<p>Ref: "Colorectal Cancer Risk Prediction Tool for White Men and Women Without Known<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Susceptibility". &nbsp;&nbsp;A Freedman et al. &nbsp;JCO &nbsp;27:686-693 2008.</p>
<p>(2) Installing the Gauss Run Time Moduel:</p>
<p>Note: &nbsp;If you have previously installed the gauss run-time module using<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRTM_11_Win_32.msi, &nbsp;you can ignore this section.</p>
<p>The gauss run-time module will execute any pre-compiled gauss program. &nbsp;It is<br />needed for the user to perform CRC Absolute Risk Projections for women by executing<br />the provided pre-compiled Gauss program &nbsp;&nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg".</p>
<p>click on &nbsp;"GRTM_11_Win_32.msi" &nbsp;to start the installation process and you are<br />using 32-bit Windows operating system.</p>
<p>(a) the installer will ask you to accept the standard license agreement. After<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you accept the agreement, it will ask you where you want to install the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gauss run-time module. &nbsp;The default folder is &nbsp;"C:\gsrun11". &nbsp;If the default<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is acceptable click "next", otherwise click "browse". &nbsp;If you clicked "browse",<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a box will appear where you can type in the destination of your installation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process. &nbsp;In the following discussion, the installation will be into the folder<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"c:\CRC_AbsRisk"</p>
<p>(b) at the completion of the installation process, the installer will place a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gauss run time module icon on your desktop. &nbsp;It is recommended leaving the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;icon on the desktop for ease of use.</p>
<p>(c) copy the six files:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Input.dat"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.list"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"WomenColnCaCovPat"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.err"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"WomenCov_1_AR_RPD"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to where you installed the gauss run time module, i.e. in this example,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c:\CRC_AbsRisk.</p>
<p>(d) you may want to copy this "WReadMe.fil" to the folder c:\CRC_AbsRisk.</p>

<p>Pattrn_ID used for input Risk Covariate Pattern edit checking as well as<br />for 95% CI calculations. &nbsp;The numbers separated by commas in the parenthesis<br />is the number of levels and valid values for the levels for the associated<br />risk covariate. &nbsp;Note that &nbsp;"sigmod" &nbsp;is the trend variable created from<br />Posi 0, Posi 1, Posi 2 and Posi 3:</p>
<p>&nbsp;sigmod = 0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Posi 0=1<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Posi 1=1<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Posi 2=1<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if Posi 3=1</p>
<p>Before exeucting the risk projection program, it should prove beneficial to<br />take a brief examination of the input file &nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Input.dat"<br />included with this package.</p>
<p>(4) Executing Women's colorectal cancer (CRC) risk program &nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg":</p>
<p>Method 1: &nbsp;Associate any file which ends with &nbsp;".gcg" &nbsp;with the gauss run time module.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this has been performed, you can just click on &nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or any file ending with &nbsp;".gcg" for that matter, and the gauss run time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moduele will execute the file and the absolute risk program will start to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;execute.</p>
<p>Method 2: &nbsp;Click on the gauss run time module icon which has been placed on your desktop<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the installer. &nbsp;The gauss run time module window will open. &nbsp;On top of the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window, will be a white rectangular box, with the name of the folder which the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gauss run time module is pointing. &nbsp;If it is pointing at the folder which<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contains &nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg" then you don't have to navigate anywhere. &nbsp;If<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not pointing at the folder which contains &nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tools.gcg", then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either use the browse buttom &nbsp;(the little gray rectangle with three dots on it)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to navigate to the correct folder, or just type in the name of the folder in the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white rectangle. &nbsp;In this discussion, you would type &nbsp;"c:\CRC_AbsRisk". &nbsp;Once<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is done, at the "&gt;&gt;" symbol, type &nbsp;"run &nbsp;Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg" and the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;absolute risk program will start to execute.</p>
<p>Once the absolute risk program &nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg" &nbsp;completes execution, it will output<br />two files. &nbsp;&nbsp;One is the output file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.out" &nbsp;which contains absolute risk associated quantities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other is the edit error file :</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.err" &nbsp;which indicates input records with editing errors.</p>
<p>It would be beneficial to look at both files. &nbsp;If the error file only contains a table heading,<br />this means that no editing errors was discovered by the program. &nbsp;Please note that this does<br />not guarantee that unanticipated errors have not occured in the input file. &nbsp;Integrity of the<br />input data is still the user's responsibility.</p>
<p>The included error file lists errors for seven records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1st error: Incorrect value &nbsp;5 for race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Race takes on the values 1,2,3 and 4<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd error: Incorrect value 49 for Age1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age1 must be ge 50.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;3rd error: Incorrect value 60 for Age1 and Age2. Age2 must be gt Age1.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;4th error: Incorrect value 91 for Age2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age2 must be le 90.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;5th error: Incorrect value &nbsp;9 for #Rel012. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Rel012 takes only values of 0,1,2.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;6th error: Incorrect value &nbsp;9 for Hours Xrcise. &nbsp;Hours Xrcise takes only values of 0,1,2,3.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;7th error: NoStrgn=1, BMIge30=1 but BMI*YesStrgn=1. &nbsp;BMI*YesStrogn should be ZERO.</p>
<p>The above seven errors are but a sub-set of all possible errors and are not meant to be exhaustive<br />of all possible errors.</p>
<p>Note that if the Pattrn_ID obtained for an input covariateis pattern from the above formula, is<br />not within the range of 1:768, the inputted covariate pattern is inadmissable and flagged.</p>
<p>Even when the Pattrn_ID is within this range, different covariate patterns may give rise to the<br />same Pattrn_ID. &nbsp;So if an input covariate pattern is flagged, the "correct" covariate pattern<br />associated with the Pattrn_ID is given below the "incorrect" input covariate pattern and a<br />covariate by covariate comparison might help in pinpointing the error.</p>
<p>Looking at the output file &nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.out", &nbsp;first note all the constants utilized by<br />this tool are listed. &nbsp;Next you will see all the inputed risk covariate information for each<br />person, as well the the projected absolute risk and 95% confidence interval. &nbsp;Note that for<br />covariate patterns which have editing errors (the first 7 records in this case), all the<br />absolute risk related output quantities are set to a missing value of &nbsp;".". &nbsp;Compare the output<br />which you obtained with the file &nbsp;"Women_CRC_Risk_Tool.list". &nbsp;There should be complete agreement,<br />with the exception of the date when the program was executed.</p>

<p>(2) Installing the Gauss Run Time Moduel:</p>
<p>Note: &nbsp;If you have previously installed the gauss run-time module using<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GRTM_11_Win_32.msi, &nbsp;you can ignore this section.</p>
<p>The gauss run-time module will execute any pre-compiled gauss program. &nbsp;It is<br />needed for the user to perform CRC Absolute Risk Projections for men by executing<br />the provided pre-compiled Gauss program &nbsp;&nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg".</p>
<p>click on &nbsp;"GRTM_11_Win_32.msi" &nbsp;to start the installation process and you are<br />using 32-bit Windows operating system.</p>
<p>(a) the installer will ask you to accept the standard license agreement. After<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;you accept the agreement, it will ask you where you want to install the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gauss run-time module. &nbsp;The default folder is &nbsp;"C:\gsrun11". &nbsp;If the default<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;is acceptable click "next", otherwise click "browse". &nbsp;If you clicked "browse",<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;a box will appear where you can type in the destination of your installation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;process. &nbsp;In the following discussion, the installation will be into the folder<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"c:\CRC_AbsRisk"</p>
<p>(b) at the completion of the installation process, the installer will place a<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gauss run time module icon on your desktop. &nbsp;It is recommended leaving the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;icon on the desktop for ease of use.</p>
<p>(c) copy the six files:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Input.dat"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.list"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MenColnCaCovPat"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.err"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"MenCov_1_AR_RPD"</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to where you installed the gauss run time module, i.e. in this example,<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c:\CRC_AbsRisk.</p>
<p>(d) you may want to copy this "MReadMe.fil" to the folder c:\CRC_AbsRisk.</p>
<p>(e) the installation process is now complete.</p>

<p>Pattrn_ID used for input Risk Covariate Pattern edit checking as well as<br />for 95% CI calculations. &nbsp;The numbers separated by commas in the parenthesis<br />is the number of levels and valid values for the levels for the associated<br />risk covariate. &nbsp;Note that &nbsp;"sigmod" &nbsp;is the trend variable created from<br />Posi 0, Posi 1, Posi 2 and Posi 3:</p>

<p>Before exeucting the risk projection program, it should prove beneficial to<br />take a brief examination of the input file &nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Input.dat"<br />included with this package.</p>
<p>(4) Executing Men's colorectal cancer (CRC) risk program &nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg":</p>
<p>Method 1: &nbsp;Associate any file which ends with &nbsp;".gcg" &nbsp;with the gauss run time module.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once this has been performed, you can just click on &nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg"<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;or any file ending with &nbsp;".gcg" for that matter, and the gauss run time<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;moduele will execute the file and the absolute risk program will start to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;execute.</p>
<p>Method 2: &nbsp;Click on the gauss run time module icon which has been placed on your desktop<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by the installer. &nbsp;The gauss run time module window will open. &nbsp;On top of the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;window, will be a white rectangular box, with the name of the folder which the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gauss run time module is pointing. &nbsp;If it is pointing at the folder which<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;contains &nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg" then you don't have to navigate anywhere. &nbsp;If<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it is not pointing at the folder which contains &nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tools.gcg", then<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;either use the browse buttom &nbsp;(the little gray rectangle with three dots on it)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;to navigate to the correct folder, or just type in the name of the folder in the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;white rectangle. &nbsp;In this discussion, you would type &nbsp;"c:\CRC_AbsRisk". &nbsp;Once<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;this is done, at the "&gt;&gt;" symbol, type &nbsp;"run &nbsp;Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg" and the<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;absolute risk program will start to execute.</p>
<p>Once the absolute risk program &nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.gcg" &nbsp;completes execution, it will output<br />two files. &nbsp;&nbsp;One is the output file:</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.out" &nbsp;which contains absolute risk associated quantities.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the other is the edit error file :</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.err" &nbsp;which indicates input records with editing errors.</p>
<p>It would be beneficial to look at both files. &nbsp;If the error file only contains a table heading,<br />this means that no editing errors was discovered by the program. &nbsp;Please note that this does<br />not guarantee that unanticipated errors have not occured in the input file. &nbsp;Integrity of the<br />input data is still &nbsp;the user's responsibility.</p>
<p>The included error file lists errors for seven records.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;1st error: Incorrect value &nbsp;5 for race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Race takes on the values 1,2,3 and 4<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;2nd error: Incorrect value 49 for Age1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age1 must be ge 50.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;3rd error: Incorrect value 60 for Age1 and Age2. Age2 must be gt Age1.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;4th error: Incorrect value 91 for Age2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Age2 must be le 90.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;5th error: Incorrect value &nbsp;9 for #Rel012. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;#Rel012 takes only values of 0,1,2.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;6th error: Incorrect value &nbsp;9 for Hours Xrcise &nbsp;&nbsp;Hours Xrcise takes only values of 0,1,2,3.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;7th error: Incorrect value &nbsp;0 for noIBup &nbsp;and &nbsp;1 for noNSAD. &nbsp;This scenairo is inadmissable.</p>
<p>The above seven errors are but a sub-set of all possible errors and are not meant to be exhaustive<br />of all possible errors.</p>
<p>Note that if the Pattrn_ID obtained for an input covariateis pattern from the above formula, is<br />not within the range of 1:18432, the inputted covariate pattern is inadmissable and flagged.</p>
<p>Even when the Pattrn_ID is within this range, different covariate patterns may give rise to the<br />same Pattrn_ID. &nbsp;So if an input covariate pattern is flagged, the "correct" covariate pattern<br />associated with the Pattrn_ID is given below the "incorrect" input covariate pattern and a<br />covariate by covariate comparison might help in pinpointing the error.</p>
<p>Looking at the output file &nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.out", &nbsp;first note all the constants utilized by<br />this tool are listed. &nbsp;Next you will see all the inputed risk covariate information for each<br />person, as well the the projected absolute risk and 95% confidence interval. &nbsp;Note that for<br />covariate patterns which have editing errors (the first 7 records in this case), all the<br />absolute risk related output quantities are set to a missing value of &nbsp;".". &nbsp;Compare the output<br />which you obtained with the file &nbsp;"Men_CRC_Risk_Tool.list". &nbsp;There should be complete agreement,<br />with the exception of the date when the program was executed.</p>

DCEG investigators in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=42&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_activeitemid=&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_contentid=302430&amp;sys_command=editrc" sys_contentid="302430" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302430" sys_variantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7274612">Clinical Genetics Branch</a> (CGB) showed that telomere length, as measured by flow cytometry-FISH was both sensitive and specific for distinguishing DC from healthy individuals and from those with other IBMFS.</p>
<p>Work at CGB has led to the discovery of three of the known causes of DC, <i>TINF2</i>, <i>WRAP53</i>, and <i>RTEL1</i>. &nbsp;DC can be inherited in X-linked (<i>DKC1</i>), autosomal dominant (<i>TERT</i>, <i>TERC</i>, <i>TINF2</i>, <i>RTEL1</i>), and autosomal recessive (<i>TERT</i>, <i>NHP2</i>, <i>NOP10</i>, <i>CTC1</i>, <i>WRAP53</i>, and <i>RTEL1</i>) patterns, or can arise due to a <i>de novo</i> germline mutation. However, approximately 40% of patients with DC do not yet have an identified causative mutation. Consequently, discovery of new high-penetrance susceptibility genes as well as low-penetrance genetic modifiers of the major genes, is a major focus of this project.</p>
<p>This study also focuses on comprehensive, systematic clinical phenotyping of DC patients, aimed at refining our understanding of the features of this rare disorder. Investigators have identified novel ophthalmologic and dental abnormalities as part of the DC spectrum of abnormalities. These studies will provide more specific data on genotype-phenotype interactions and aid in diagnosis of DC.</p>

<p>In addition, DCEG investigators recently performed a quantitative analysis of the reported literature on DC-related malignancy, and published the first quantitative estimates of the risks of acute leukemia, squamous cell cancers of the skin, head/neck and anogenital region in this disorder. The cumulative cancer risk in DC patients is nearly as high as those seen in patients with Fanconi anemia.</p>

<p>Since 1992, DCEG and other NCI investigators, along with collaborators from five field study centers, have been actively following diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposed and unexposed mothers, daughters and sons, and granddaughters for adverse health effects resulting from this exposure. As DES-exposed offspring are currently reaching the age when cancer rates begin to rise, it is important to continue to monitor long-term risk of cancer and other adverse health outcomes in this unique population.</p>

<p>The study also provides a model for assessing a number of hypotheses that address concerns about prenatal hormonal influences on disease risk, both an intriguing area of science and an increasingly controversial environmental issue that affects a substantial proportion of the population.</p>
<p>To date the study has identified excess female breast cancer after age 40 that shows a dose-response effect, as well as increased risk for high-grade lesions of the cervix and vagina. Concern over other hormone-related cancers remains; though to date analyses have been limited due to small numbers of cases. In the sons, investigators observed an excess risk for urogenital anomalies and infertility, and a likely excess of testicular cancer. To examine the effects in the third generation (the daughters of the prenatally exposed daughters), investigators assembled a small cohort in 2000. Given their average age, there have been few relevant disease outcomes. However, investigators noted an elevated risk for infertility&mdash;though not statistically significant, this outcome was also seen in DES-daughters. In addition, there were three cases of ovarian cancer in the granddaughters, even though substantially less than one had been expected. While both of these observations remain difficult to interpret, they have added some urgency to expand the cohort and continue to follow-up.</p>

<p>In cancer research, absolute risk is defined as the likelihood that a person who is free of a specific type of cancer at a given age will develop that cancer over a certain period of time. DCEG investigators have developed models (such as the Gail model) for projecting the individualized absolute risk of certain types of cancer. These models have been used to counsel individual patients on their disease risk; to make more formal management recommendations, such as whether or not to take tamoxifen to prevent breast cancer; to design cancer prevention trials; and to assess the potential reductions in population absolute risk from preventive activities.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>NCI Risk Assessment Tools</h3>
<p>DCEG investigators and their colleagues have employed absolute risk modeling to develop tools that clinicians and their patients can use to calculate risk of developing the following cancers:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov/">Breast cancer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://ccrisktool.cancer.gov/">Colorectal cancer</a></li>
<li><a href="https://mrisktool.cancer.gov/">Melanoma</a> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<p>The Radiation Risk Assessment Tool is an online calculator for estimating the lifetime risk of cancer incidence for members of the U.S. population (or countries with similar cancer incidence rates) from exposure to ionizing radiation for doses below 1 Gy.</p>
<p>The calculator works using organ-specific dose estimates according to age at exposure and sex. Lifetime total cancer risk and organ-specific risk estimates are reported along with a 90% uncertainty range.</p>
<p>The reported lifetime risks are based on the risk models for the eleven cancers included in the 2006 report of the National Academies of Sciences' BEIR VII Committee and on the risk models for an additional eight cancers, developed by the NCI after the publication of the BEIR VII report.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<h3><a id="Background"></a>I. Background</h3>
<p>As part of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics&rsquo; mission to discover the causes of cancer and the means of its prevention, DCEG is committed to sharing research data to further advance science, improve public health, and leverage the investment made by the U.S. taxpayers in the Division&rsquo;s research program.</p>
<p>Data sharing must be conducted in a manner consistent with federal, state, and local laws and policies concerning privacy, confidentiality, protection from discrimination, the honoring of informed consent, as well as other restrictions related to institutional review board (IRB) approvals. For some studies, there may be data that cannot be shared because of conditions placed upon DCEG by the individuals or organizations who supplied the data to DCEG for the original research.</p>
<h3><a id="General-Considerations"></a>II. General Considerations</h3>
<h4><a id="Privacy-Confidentiality"></a>A. Protecting Privacy and Confidentiality</h4>
<p>DCEG has the highest commitment to protecting the identity of study participants against undesired intrusions (privacy) and to limiting access to study information that might individually identify them (confidentiality). All direct identifiers are omitted from data sets; however, because study data often include extremely detailed personal information (<em>e.g.</em>, age, gender, race, residence, employment histories, medical histories), it may be possible in rare cases through complex analysis and with outside information, to identify specific subjects.&nbsp;Therefore, DCEG will redact data as necessary to protect study subject privacy, particularly for data requested under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) mechanism (<a href="#Freedom-of-Information-Act">see Section III.D</a>). Less data redaction may be necessary under Data Transfer Agreements (DTA) that contain provisions assuring that the researchers will not try to learn the identity of subjects or link the shared data with individually identifiable records from other sources (<a href="#Data-Transfer-Agreement">see Section III.C</a>).</p>
<h4><a id="Timing-Data-Sharing"></a>B. Timing of Data Sharing</h4>
<p>While DCEG is committed to data sharing, we believe the optimal time to provide data is after the cleaning and quality control processes have been completed and there is a final analytic data set.&nbsp;The reasons for this are related to NIH policy and data quality.&nbsp;Prior to this time-point, study data sets cannot be considered &ldquo;final.&rdquo; Throughout data collection and analysis, various actions are undertaken to detect out-of-range, illogical, and inconsistent data, to check original sources, and to correct data as needed.&nbsp;Because this process can continue up to the time a paper is accepted for publication, sharing data prior to that time is not advisable.</p>
<h4><a id="Assistance-Investigators"></a>C.&nbsp;Assistance from DCEG Investigators</h4>
<p>In response to outside requests, DCEG will provide the necessary documentation (<em>e.g.</em>, questionnaires, coding manual, data dictionaries) to understand and analyze study data. Further assistance from DCEG investigators, however, may not be possible due to time constraints and the competing demands of their positions.&nbsp;Researchers requesting data through mechanisms other than a mutually&ndash;agreed upon scientific collaboration with a DCEG investigator should not expect assistance beyond the provision of standard study documentation.</p>
<h4><a id="Cost"></a>D.&nbsp;Cost</h4>
<p>Due to fiscal constraints, DCEG reserves the right to require payments to cover the cost of producing data sets and accompanying documentation.</p>
<h3><a id="Methods-Access-Data"></a>III. Methods to Access Data</h3>
<p>There are various methods to access data, depending on whether there are established study-specific application and review procedures, whether the requestor prefers to collaborate with DCEG investigators or to work independently, and whether special precautions are needed to protect the privacy of study subjects or the confidentiality of study data. Depending on the data elements of interest, there may be special considerations affecting requests from investigators outside the U.S.</p>
<h4><a id="Study-Specific"></a>A. Study-specific Application and Review Procedures</h4>
<p><em>Epidemiologic data</em>: Several of DCEG&rsquo;s large prospective cohort studies have established procedures whereby researchers can request data, and some have publicly available data posted on their study websites. Some have regularly scheduled calls for proposals, while others accept proposals or more general requests for data on an ongoing basis.&nbsp;Typically, researchers must submit proposals detailing their research plans.&nbsp;Information on the following studies can be found at these websites:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><a href="http://aghealth.nci.nih.gov">Agricultural Health Study</a><br /><a href="http://atbcstudy.cancer.gov">Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Study</a>&nbsp; <br /><a href="http://dietandhealth.cancer.gov">NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study</a>&nbsp; <br /><a href="https://biometry.nci.nih.gov/cdas/plco/">PLCO Study</a><br /><a href="http://radtechstudy.nci.nih.gov">Radiologic Technologists Study</a></p>
<p>Other DCEG studies have published findings in journals that require access to data that underlie the results described in their manuscripts. Most DCEG studies involve human subjects, and the protection of study participants and their private information is required by law. The DCEG Data Repository Committee accepts requests for these published data sets, and reviews the data sets prior to release to ensure that confidentiality of individuals participating in DCEG studies is maintained.</p>
<p><em>Genomic Data</em>:&nbsp;In accordance with the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/grants-training/grants-management/nci-policies/genomic-data">NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy</a>, qualified genomic data generated by DCEG will generally be made available through an NIH-designated repository such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=gap">Database of Genotypes and Phenotypes (dbGaP)</a> and/or the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra">Sequence Read Archive (SRA)</a>, and the NCI&rsquo;s <a href="https://gdc.nci.nih.gov/">Genomic Data Commons (GDC)</a>.&nbsp;Researchers may obtain controlled-access data only with the permission of the NCI Data Access Committee (DAC), which operates according to the policies established by the NIH.&nbsp;For controlled-access data, the requestor must stipulate in a Data Use Certification that they will comply with federal, state, and local policy; will only use the data for the specified research use; will not identify study participants; will not transfer the data; and other provisions.&nbsp;An institute official must vouch that the requestor is a bona fide researcher, and must also stipulate to the provisions related to privacy and use of the data.&nbsp;Additionally, an IT Director at the requesting institution must be identified to vouch that the data are being stored and maintained in a secure fashion.&nbsp;The federal Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act, which makes it illegal for health insurance companies, group health plans, and most employers to discriminate based on genetic information, is also relevant to these requests.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://dbgap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/aa/wga.cgi?login=&amp;page=login">Obtain information on submitting a Data Access Request for data stored in dbGap</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="Collaboration-Investigators"></a>B. Collaboration with DCEG Investigators</h4>
<p>Many researchers interested in accessing data from DCEG studies prefer to do so by establishing a scientific collaboration with DCEG investigators.&nbsp;Through these formal collaborations, the DCEG team members can share their expertise and knowledge of the intricacies of the study data, which greatly enhances the research endeavor.&nbsp;A collaborative agreement is developed which details the data to be shared, the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved, and consistency of the proposed research with the study informed consent and IRB approvals.</p>
<p>Researchers should <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/directory">contact the appropriate DCEG investigator directly</a> to determine if a mutually agreeable scientific collaboration can be established.</p>
<h4><a id="Data-Transfer-Agreement"></a>C. Data Transfer Agreement</h4>
<p>DCEG data for collaborative and non-collaborative research will be released under the terms of a Data Transfer Agreement, which must be signed by the DCEG Director, the recipient scientist, and an official representing the recipient scientist&rsquo;s institution. The agreement will specify the proposed research plan, identify who will have access to the data, and contain provisions related to protecting privacy. These provisions will require that: 1) the requesting researcher will neither attempt to link nor permit others to link the data set with individually-identifiable records from any other data set, and 2) the researcher will not attempt to use the data set or permit others to use it to learn the identify of any person.&nbsp;In addition, the relevant NIH IRB must provide an assurance that the proposed research and data transfer are consistent with informed consent.&nbsp;If the agreement is for non-collaborative research, DCEG investigators will not be able to assist the requestor beyond provision of standard study documentation.</p>
<p>Researchers should <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/directory">contact the appropriate DCEG investigator directly</a> to request data and develop a Data Transfer Agreement.</p>
<h4><a id="Freedom-of-Information-Act"></a>D.&nbsp;Freedom of Information Act Request (FOIA)</h4>
<p>FOIA requires federal agencies to provide access to agency records except to the extent that such records are protected from public disclosure by one of nine exemptions or three law enforcement exclusions. The exemptions that most often apply to DCEG records are those that prohibit disclosure of records that are: 1) specifically exempted by another federal law (e.g., the Privacy Act of 1974) (Exemption 3); 2) privileged inter-agency or intra-agency communications that are pre-decisional and part of an agency&rsquo;s deliberative process (Exemption 5); and 3) personnel, medical, or similar files, release of which would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy (Exemption 6). Requestors should note that because there are no restrictions placed on use or further dissemination of records obtained through a FOIA request, DCEG takes special care to protect subjects from invasion of privacy that might result from linking the data set to individually identifiable records from any other data set.&nbsp;FOIA allows the agency to recover part of the cost of responding to a request.&nbsp;DCEG investigators will not be able to assist the requestor to use or interpret the data beyond provision of standard study documentation. Details on FOIA are available at the <a href="http://www.nih.gov/icd/od/foia/index.htm">Freedom of Information Act Office</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>FOIA requests for DCEG records should be submitted to the National Cancer Institute FOIA Coordinator, Building 31, Room 10A48, 9000 Rockville Pike, Bethesda, MD 20892.</p>

<p>appropriate sas file/sas variable names must be associated with all macro parameters<br />on the invocation of the sas macro &nbsp;"BrCa_RAM".</p>
<p>For example by coding &nbsp;"In_File = AARPin" &nbsp;tells the macro that the user created<br />sas file &nbsp;"AARPin" &nbsp;is to be used for input of variables. &nbsp;Similarly coding<br />"N_Biop = Num_Biops", &nbsp;lets the macro know that the sas variable "Num_Biops" in the<br />sas input file &nbsp;"AARPin" &nbsp;contiains the count of the # of biopsies performed.</p>
<p>To involke the sas macro in your sas program, an %include statement must be coded in<br />your sas program, which points to the sas macro &nbsp;"BrCa_RAM".</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>the statement: %include "BrCa_RAM"; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;points to the sas macro &nbsp;BrCa_RAM<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stored in your current directory</p>
<p>the statement: %include "c:\sas.macro\BrCa_RAM"; &nbsp;&nbsp;points to the sas macro &nbsp;BrCa_RAM<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;stored in the directory<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;c:\sas.macro</p>

<p>After the absolute risks have been generated, descriptive statistics by applying PROC<br />MEANS to the quantities Error_Ind, AbsRsk, RR_Star1 and RR_Star2 is performed. &nbsp;When the<br />mean and standard deviation for the variable &nbsp;"Error_Ind" &nbsp;is 0, implies that no errors<br />have not been found. &nbsp;Otherwise when the mean and std for &nbsp;"Error_Ind" is not 0, implies<br />that errors have been found. &nbsp;When errors are found, the # of records with errors is<br />the count asscociated with "AbsRsk" listed under NMiss (# of missing). &nbsp;Furthermore, a<br />listing file for erroronious records follows the PROC Means output. &nbsp;For example:</p>

Similarly for IDs 3,9,11,12,14 and 15 which display violations of<br />Requirements (A). &nbsp;For IDs 19 and 20, violation of AgeMen and/or Age1st consistency<br />are seen. &nbsp;Note the SAS missing value "." listed under AgeMen and/or Age1st.<br />For IDs 23, 24 and 25 violation of T1 and/or T2 consistency requirements are seen.<br />Again, note the "." listed under T1 and/or T2. &nbsp;This small sample data set "Sample.in"<br />in no way exhausts all the possible ways in which the data can be in error, but it should<br />give a guide and indication on how to check and correct errors when they do occur.</p>

<p>Testicular cancer is the most commonly occurring cancer among young men (ages 15&ndash;40 years) in many countries, including the United States. The great majority of testicular cancers are testicular germ cell tumors (TGCTs), which can be further subdivided into seminomas, nonseminomas and spermatocytic tumors. Seminomas and nonseminomas are associated with other male reproductive disorders and are thought to be initiated <em>in utero</em>. MEB investigators conduct research on a variety of factors in relationship to testicular cancer including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hormonal hypotheses</li>
<li>Endocrine disrupting chemicals</li>
<li>Racial/ethnic disparity in risk</li>
<li>Genetic susceptibility</li>

<p>Estrogens play important roles in the pathophysiology of breast tumors and are recognized causal factors in the etiology of breast cancer; this central insight has led to many of the available preventive and therapeutic interventions for breast cancer. Endogenous estrogens may also play causal roles in endometrial and ovarian cancers and could also be important in male reproductive cancers, such as male breast cancer, testicular cancer, and prostate cancer. Substantial inter-individual variability has been observed in levels of circulating and excreted estrogens and estrogen metabolites (jointly referred to as EM) among men, postmenopausal women, and premenopausal women. Because EM vary with respect to bioavailability, affinity to estrogen receptors, and mutagenic potential, investigators have hypothesized that variations in estrogen profiles may account for inter-individual differences in cancer risks. Until recently, it has been difficult to study this hypothesis in epidemiologic settings. Development of a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC/MS-MS) method for measurement of estrogens and estrogen metabolites in urine (Xu et al., <i>Anal Chem</i> 2006;78:1553) and serum (Xu et al., <i>Anal Chem</i> 2007;79:7813) represents an important methodologic development because it provides an assay with characteristics that make it feasible for use in epidemiologic studies: high sensitivity, specificity, reliability, and scalability for high-throughput work.</p>
<p>Expanding on our research evaluating endogenous estrogens and estrogen metabolites and cancer risk, recent methodologic advances in the measurement of androgens and androgen metabolites as well as progesterone, pregnenolone, and progesterone metabolites in serum will facilitate epidemiologic studies to evaluate the role of principal estrogens, androgens and progesterone, together with their major metabolites, in cancer etiology.</p>

<p>Workers often have heavier and more prolonged exposures to hazardous chemicals that also occur in the general environment, but at lower levels. When excess risks are detected from workplace studies, they may provide important leads as to the etiology of cancer in other settings. Occupational studies conducted by OEEB investigators have identified many chemicals that cause cancer in humans, and they have provided direction for initiatives aimed at reducing or eliminating these carcinogens in the workplace and elsewhere.</p>

<p>Evaluation of exposure-response relationships is a crucial component in assessment of causes of cancer. Quantitative exposure assessment is therefore an essential element in high-quality epidemiologic investigations. Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) investigators devote considerable effort to improving exposure assessment techniques and evaluating the reliability and validity of procedures used in cohort and case-control studies of occupational and environmental exposures.&nbsp;Below are a few examples.</p>
<h2>Geographic Information Systems (GIS) Methods in Environmental Epidemiology</h2>
<p>Epidemiologic investigations of environment-cancer relationships rely on accurate, quantifiable exposure measurements. Such studies may use <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1087390" sys_contentid="1087390" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1087390" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7267104">Geographic Information Systems (GIS)</a> and regulatory and other environmental monitoring data to complement retrospective surveys, which are sometimes limited by participants&rsquo; knowledge of exposures in their surrounding environments. Cancer studies have benefited from the increasing availability of historical air and water monitoring data, satellite imagery, census, commercial databases, and other geographic datasets that allow for reconstruction of residence- and other location-based exposures over a substantial portion of a person&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
<p>OEEB investigators implement GIS-based exposure assessments using georeferenced data resources and residential histories collected in our studies of environmental hazards and cancer risk. Our approaches include using GIS and spatial-analytic methods to characterize exposure to environmental risk factors, incorporating space-time-activity information in exposure assessments, and employing biological and environmental measurements for exposure validation. This work addresses important epidemiologic considerations in geography-based environmental exposure assessments, including residential mobility and time spent in various microenvironments, positional error, and the challenges of extrapolation over space and time. These approaches have been implemented in a number of DCEG and OEEB studies, including to assess drinking water nitrate exposure among private well users in the Agricultural Health Study, to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=976905" sys_contentid="976905" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="976905" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7267105">estimate ambient air pollution in the Southern California Ultrafines Study</a>, and to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1087366" sys_contentid="1087366" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1087366" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7267106">validate estimated dioxin exposure metrics</a>.</p>

<h2>Industry-based Studies</h2>
<p>OEEB investigators have developed state-of-the-art quantitative exposure assessment methods that maximized the available measurements and exposure determinant information to predict historical exposure levels in several studies including diesel exhaust in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=41&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303672" sys_contentid="303672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303672" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7267099">Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study</a>, benzene in a cohort study of&nbsp;<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302387" sys_contentid="302387" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302387" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7267095">Benzene-Exposed Workers in China</a>, and specific pesticides within the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303742" sys_contentid="303742" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303742" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7267096">Agricultural Health Study</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Population-based Studies</h2>
<h3>Exposure Assessment Using Job Exposure Matrices</h3>
<p>Job Exposure Matrices (JEMs) are an efficient way to assign exposure estimates in population-based studies and may be the only exposure assessment option when only job and industry are available for study participants. DCEG investigators develop methods to improve JEMs by incorporating databases of exposure measurements to calibrate JEMs across time and across jobs and industries. For example, in the Shanghai Women's Health Study, investigators developed a novel framework to systematically combine a JEM with historical measurements to calibrate JEM exposure ratings used to estimate historical benzene and lead exposure.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Exposure Assessment Using Occupation- and Industry-specific Modules</h3>
<p>Occupation- and industry-specific modules ask detailed questions about work activities and exposures within its population-based case-control studies to better capture within-occupation differences in exposure. Usually these module responses are reviewed job-by-job by an exposure assessor to assign exposure estimates. OEEB investigators develop methods to more efficiently and transparently assign exposure in studies that use modules and examine the validity and reliability of these methods. Decision rules that link questionnaire responses to exposure estimates have been developed to assess occupational exposures in US case-control studies, including metalworking fluids, diesel exhaust, lead and benzene. In an evaluation of the reliability of decision rule approaches we found that decision rule estimates of occupational diesel exhaust exposure for the New England Bladder Cancer Study had moderately-high agreement with estimates obtained from expert reviews of each job. Exposure estimates in the decision rules are data-driven wherever possible, including use of subjects&rsquo; answers to occupation and industry-specific modules and use of job group medians derived from module responses to assign exposure to those in similar jobs without a completed module. Intensity estimates are based on synthesis of publicly available data sources whenever possible (see next section). We have also developed a method to extract patterns in the questionnaire responses that predict an expert&rsquo;s exposure assignments using classification and regression tree (CART) models. The extracted decision rules have been used to improve the transparency and efficiency of applying the exposure decisions to other study subjects.</p>

<h3>Synthesis of Publicly Available Exposure Data Sources</h3>
<p>To assist exposure assessment efforts, OEEB conducts comprehensive literature reviews for specific agents to identify when, where, and how much exposure to that agent was likely to occur. Exposure concentrations identified in these reviews are extracted into exposure databases that can be used to characterize exposure determinants, such as time trends. We extended the use meta-regression models to identify exposure determinants of published occupational and environmental measurements, which are generally reported as summary statistics, for several exposures, including lead, benzene, and pesticides.</p>

<h3>Use of Sensors and Smartphone Technologies</h3>
<p>OEEB investigators use state-of-the-art technologies in field studies to characterize exposure, including use of direct reading sensors (e.g., black carbon, ultrafine particulate, PM<sub>2.5</sub>) and smartphone apps to collect work activity diaries.</p>

<p>Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) conduct research on 1) infectious agents with established or postulated associations with cancer and 2) immune perturbations relevant for cancer risk, including severe immunosuppression, autoimmune diseases, and chronic inflammation. Based on findings from etiologic research, IIB investigators look for opportunities to translate findings to cancer prevention, risk stratification, and screening.</p>
<p>Approximately 15 percent&nbsp;of all cancers are attributable to infectious agents. Infection-related cancers thus represent a major public health burden. For cancers where the role of an infection is established, IIB research aims to further elucidate the etiologic association by investigating topics ranging from acquisition of infection to the occurrence of cancer, including the natural history of infections, genetic and environmental cofactors that modulate cancer risk, biomarkers of cancer risk, and accurate estimation of absolute cancer risk among infected individuals. We also examine primary and secondary prevention strategies for these cancers.<br />&nbsp;<br />Another important focus of IIB research is the etiologic role of immunity and inflammation in cancer. IIB researchers address key questions regarding the spectrum of cancer among immunosuppressed individuals and the mechanisms underlying increased cancer risk in those populations. IIB investigators study both systemic and local immunity and inflammation to unravel their contributions to cancer etiology. We also look for opportunities to identify novel infections that contribute to cancer, which are often signaled when a rare cancer is found to occur at markedly increased incidence in immunosuppressed populations.</p>

<p>Gastric (stomach) cancer occurs when cancer cells form in the lining of the stomach. Increased incidence of noncardia gastric cancer among specific populations in the U.S. have led investigators in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) to study serologic screening markers, pathogenic microbes and molecular pathology in order to increase knowledge of disease etiology and decrease the burden of disease. Selected studies include:</p>
<h2>Autoimmune Gastritis</h2>
<p>DCEG investigators in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) have documented unprecedented increases of noncardia gastric cancer among younger generations in the U.S. Analyses of incidence trends reveal a coherent set of features that suggest autoimmune gastritis may be the underlying cause.

<p>Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the cancers caused by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and a family history of the disease is the strongest nonviral risk factor. Investigators in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) have been evaluating EBV-based markers for use in early detection of NPC, and are also studying the genetic risk factors associated with the disease. Selected studies include:</p>
<h2>Nasopharyngeal Case-Control Study</h2>
<p>Two case-control studies were conducted in Taiwan between 1991-1994 and 2010-2014.&nbsp; Together, these two studies included more than 2,000 NPC cases and more than 2,400 controls and were designed to examine the role of viral, environmental, and genetic factors associated with the development of nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

<h2>Nasopharyngeal Family Study</h2>
<p>A family study in Taiwan to elucidate genetic factors linked to the development of nasopharyngeal cancer and to evaluate clinically useful viral markers of disease risk was started in the mid 1990s. Using the national cancer registry, investigators identified and recruited more than 3,200 individuals from 358 nasopharyngeal carcinoma multiplex families. Active and passive follow-up of these families and their members is ongoing.

<h2>EBV Screening for the Early Detection of Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma</h2>
<p>The Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)&nbsp;screening for the early detection of NPC in China demonstration project includes a group of approximately 30,000 men and women ages 35-69 recruited into the active screening arm of a community-randomized trial to evaluate the impact of EBV-based antibody screening on NPC mortality rates. As part of this effort, NCI is collaborating on a substudy to evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of endoscopy versus MRI for the detection of NPC and the utility of nasopharynx viral load testing to triage EBV antibody positive individuals.

<p>Energy balance &mdash; the difference between dietary energy intake and energy expended through physical activity and resting metabolism - is thought to increase the risk of several important cancers, including colon, post-menopausal breast, endometrium, kidney, and esophagus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The high prevalence of obesity and physical inactivity is a worldwide public health issue, yet the mechanisms by which energy imbalance and obesity cause cancer remain unclear. MEB investigators are pursuing several approaches to address these issues, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improvement of assessment tools for diet, physical activity, and body size, in order to disentangle these interrelated exposures;</li>
<li>Performance of etiologic studies in high-risk populations (e.g., South Asians);</li>
<li>Studies of biochemical mechanisms, including the use of high-throughput multiplex assays of possible obesity-related biomarkers (such as inflammatory markers/cytokines, metabolic hormones, and sex hormones).</li>

<h2>Major research areas</h2>
<h3>Breast Cancer</h3>
<p>The goal is to study molecular mechanisms underlying breast carcinogenesis and etiologic heterogeneity of breast cancers through integrative molecular epidemiology studies, including morphologic and molecular characterization of normal and tumor breast tissues. Research areas include molecular epidemiology of mammographic density, one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer; morphologic features of terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs) in non-malignant breast tissue in relation to breast cancer risk; GWAS of breast cancer subtypes; somatic profiling of tumors in relation to germline and environmental exposures in different populations (European, Asian and African ancestry); and study of the interrelation of genetic and environmental risk factors, tumor features and clinical progression using targeted DNA sequencing and immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization analysis of thousands of breast tumors in the international consortium <a href="http://www.b-cast.eu/">Breast CAncer STratification (BCAST) Project</a>.</p>

<h3>Chordoma</h3>
<p>Chordoma is a rare bone cancer (diagnosed in about 300 patients in the U.S. each year) that develops at the base of the skull, in a vertebra, or at end of the spine. It is believed to develop from remnants of the notochord. While the majority of people with chordoma have no other family members with this cancer, a small number of families with multiple relatives with chordoma have been reported worldwide, suggesting that genetic factors may cause susceptibility of chordoma in these families.</p>
<p>DCEG investigators have been <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=29&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302494" sys_contentid="302494" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7252268" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302494" sys_dependentvariantid="1418">studying chordoma families</a> with the goal of finding the mutated or altered genes that cause&nbsp;familial chordoma, and whether chordoma-prone families are at increased risk of other cancers.&nbsp;They are also trying to determine&nbsp;whether the genes altered in chordoma families play a role in the&nbsp;development of chordoma in <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303762" sys_contentid="303762" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7252269" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303762" sys_dependentvariantid="1418">people in the general population <em>without</em> family history of this cancer (sporadic chordoma)</a>. Investigators have identified germline duplication of the <em>T</em> gene as a major susceptibility mechanism in some chordoma families, and through subsequent analyses have identified multiple common and rare <em>T</em> variants associated with chordoma risk. Studies to identify additional susceptibility genes in chordoma families are ongoing.</p>
<h3>Kidney Cancer</h3>
<p><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1062981" sys_contentid="1062981" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7252271" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1062981" sys_dependentvariantid="1418">Intra-tumor heterogeneity and tumor evolution are being studied in kidney cancer histological subtypes</a> based on whole-genome sequencing, deep target sequencing, whole genome methylation and SNP array analyses.</p>
<h3>Lung Cancer</h3>
<p>The goal is to study the genetic and environmental determinants of lung cancer using an integrative approach that allows the investigation of the process that begins with smoking initiation and persistence, continues with lung cancer development, and ends with progression to disseminated disease or response to therapy and survival. Investigators are using data from a large population-based case control study in the Lombardy region of Italy, called the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303605" sys_contentid="303605" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7252272" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303605" sys_dependentvariantid="1418">Environment And Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study</a>.</p>
<p>Studies include exogenous and host factors in relation to lung cancer risk and determinants of lung cancer progression through integrative analyses of tissue profiling data. Tumor evolution and intra-tumor heterogeneity of different histologic subtypes of lung cancer are being investigated through whole genome sequencing; deep target sequencing of the major driver genes; SNP array; and whole-genome methylation analysis of multiple regions of the same tumor. The impact of lung microbiota and tumor microenvironment on tumor evolution and clinical outcomes is being studied through 16S RNA gene, immunohistochemistry and RNA sequencing analyses.</p>
<h3>Melanoma</h3>
<p>Converging lines of evidence suggest that melanoma comprises biologically distinct subtypes. DCEG investigators are undertaking <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1065467" sys_contentid="1065467" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7252273" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1065467" sys_dependentvariantid="1418">tissue-based and genomic studies to provide a comprehensive classification of primary melanomas and the molecular changes associated with metastatic potential</a>.</p>

<p>Using data from large-scale GWAS that evaluate hundreds of thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), investigators at the LTG are studying the associations between genetic markers and cancer risk. To understand the biology underlying these associations, investigators are following up with focused validation studies, deep-sequencing, and functional analyses, such as analyses of expression levels and methylation patterns. This research relies on multidisciplinary approaches from population genetics, epidemiology and molecular evolution.</p>
<p>LTG has a series of international collaborations collecting cancer patient material and data for pediatric and adult cancers.</p>
<p>LTG works closely with the NCI CGR. CGR designs and conducts high throughput sequencing and genotyping in support of large-scale epidemiologic studies within the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. CGR is also involved in the development of powerful bioinformatics tools that handle high volume genotype data generated from GWAS.</p>
<h3>Genome-Wide Association Studies</h3>
<p><img class="left" alt="" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=420789" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" sys_dependentid="420789" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="7267124" sys_siteid="475" />GWAS have yielded close to 750 regions in the genome associated with 135 different diseases and traits. Of these,&nbsp;over 500&nbsp;regions are associated with nearly two dozen cancers, and at least 30 regions are associated with multiple cancers. To more fully understand these novel findings, laboratory studies at the LTG are identifying the causal variants responsible for these associations through validation, deep sequencing, and translational work. In doing so, researchers are providing functional and biological insights into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>These efforts would not be possible without NCI&rsquo;s long term investment in the <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/cohort.html">Cohort Consortium</a>, an international partnership of four million people from 41 cohorts, comprised of diverse populations. The cohorts provide extensive risk factor data and biospecimens, including germline DNA.</p>
<h3>Partnerships and Collaborations</h3>
<p>Collaborations and partnerships play a pivotal role in the next wave of genome-wide association studies. Data pooling has become essential in order to achieve the statistical power necessary to detect associations between genomic variants and a variety of health outcomes. High-density chips and emerging technologies now allow the genotyping of millions of SNPs across the genome. Partnerships between the LTG and numerous NCI grantee research organizations are underway, allowing investigation into carcinogenic pathways and gene-environment interactions.</p>

<h3>Section 2: File Formats</h3>
<p>Here, we discuss the actual file formats needed by CRaVe</p>
<p><b>1) Genotypes for a set of individuals at a list of SNPs.&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>The genotype file can either be in variant call format, which usually ends with .vcf or it can be in a transposed PLINK ped file, which usually ends in .tped. Details about each type of file can be found at <a href="http://www.1000genomes.org/wiki/analysis/vcf4.0">.vcf</a> and <a href="http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/data.shtml#ped">.tped</a> and examples can be found at <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1500&amp;sys_contentid=431440" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="431440" sys_dependentvariantid="1500" sys_relationshipid="6703604" sys_siteid="475">VCF</a> and <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1500&amp;sys_contentid=431439" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="431439" sys_dependentvariantid="1500" sys_relationshipid="6703605" sys_siteid="475">TPED</a>.</p>
<p><b>2) Gene or Group ID for each SNP&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Both .tped and .vcf files include chromosome and position for each SNP. Installed with CRaVe is the database hg19/ncbi build 37. The database is partitioned by chromosome into files named chr_xx.txt.gz, where xx is the chromosome number. These files have the specific format as defined by the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=433207" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="433207" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="6703614" sys_siteid="475">gene_file</a> option (see link for key details). The <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=433207" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="433207" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="6703615" sys_siteid="475">gene_file</a> option refers to the <span color="FF0000">directory</span> where the chr_xx.txt.gz files are located. If say, the hg18/build 36 coordinates are needed, then a user can download them from <a href="#dl">here</a>, use the command &amp;quottar &ndash;xzvf hg18.tar.gz" to un-pack the files, and then use the option <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=433207" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="433207" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="6703616" sys_siteid="475">gene_file</a> when running CRaVe. For instance, if the files for hg18 have been downloaded into folder ./mydata/someFolder3 and un-packed, then an example run might look like:</p>
<p>./crave geno_file=someFile.vcf gene_file=./mydata/someFolder3/hg18 pheno_file=someFile.txt tests=RO,SUM,TH</p>
<p>Note that the folder hg18 gets automatically created when un-packing the file hg18.tar.gz. A user can also specify their own categorization in their own files provided their files are named chr_xx.txt.gz, where xx is the chromosome number, and they all have the format as described in the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=433207" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="433207" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="6703617" sys_siteid="475">gene_file</a> option. An (uncompressed) example file can be found here <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1500&amp;sys_contentid=431435" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="431435" sys_dependentvariantid="1500" sys_relationshipid="6703618" sys_siteid="475">geneFile</a>.</p>
<p><b>3) Phenotypes for a set of individuals&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>This file should consist of at least 2 columns. By default, CRaVe asumes column 1 is for the subject ids and column 2 is for the response.</p>
<p>Column 1: Subject ID</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000;" color="#FF0000">When the genotype file is a .tped file, the subjects listed in the phenotype file must match their order in the genotype file.</span> When the genotype file is a .vcf file, their order is inconsequential but the subject IDs must match those in the .vcf file.</p>
<p>Column 2: Phenotype Value.</p>
<p>If case/control status, use 0/1 values so CRaVe understands it is looking at a case/control study. Different case-control values can be specified by using the <span color="0000FF">case_value</span> and <span color="0000FF">control_value</span> options.</p>
<p>This file can also contain additional columns containing covariate values for an individual. To adjust for covariates, one must use the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=433208" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="433208" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="6703606" sys_siteid="475">covars</a> option.

<p>Some tests are modified versions of those described by their original authors. The user needs to list the desired tests in the command line with the option <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=433263" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="433263" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="6703611" sys_siteid="475">tests=</a>. Without including any tests, CRaVe defaults to calculating HOI. Some tests run much faster than others because they never require performing a matrix inversion. These faster tests are: FI, HOI, RO, STP and STO.</p>
<h3>Section 4: Command Line</h3>
<p>The simplest command, when the user has listed the SNPs by their hg19 positions, only requests ROVER, and does not use bioinformatic weights would be</p>
<p>./crave geno_file=someFile.vcf pheno_file=someFile.txt</p>
<p>However, in general, the user will want to specify multiple options. Most options are specified by their name, followed by an "=" sign, followed by the desired value. Below are a few examples.</p>
<p>./crave geno_file=someFile.vcf pheno_file=someFile.txt tests=RO,SUM,TH<br />./crave geno_file=someFile.vcf pheno_file=someFile.txt max_miss_rate=0.5<br />./crave geno_file=someFile.vcf pheno_file=someFile.txt exclude_snp=/temp/remove_SNPs.txt<br />./crave geno_file=someFile.vcf pheno_file=someFile.txt include_chr=1-5,22</p>
<p>If crave_001.tar.gz was installed in folder /someFolder1 and the genotype and phenotype files are in folder /someFolder2, then the command would look similar to</p>
<p>/someFolder1/crave geno_file=/someFolder2/someFile.vcf pheno_file=/someFolder2/someFile.txt</p>
<p>The list of options include:</p>

<h3>Section 5: Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
<p><b>1) How does CRaVe handle highly correlated genotypes?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Correlation only poses a problem for statistics that include terms from the inverse of the correlation matrix s. When s is non-invertible, we invert s+cI, where I is the identity matrix and c is a small value.</p>
<p><b>2) Can I define my own test statistic?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Yes. A user can define a test statistic as a R function or C function. For those accustomed to R, CRaVe greatly speeds up the calculation of the permuted p-value. For more information see <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=433264" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="433264" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="6703613" sys_siteid="475">user-defined</a>.</p>

<p>For over 50 years, mortality and incidence rates for bladder cancer are higher in New England than in most parts of the United States. This population-based, case-control study of bladder cancer in New Hampshire, Vermont, and Maine sought to explain the reasons for the persistent excess of rates of bladder cancer in the northern New England area.</p>
<p>Investigators collected data on 2,600 participants via personal interview, biological samples (blood, buccal cells, urine, toenails, and tumor tissue), as well as drinking water samples. They found that drinking water from private wells, particularly dug wells established during the first half of the 20th century, may have contributed to the elevated risk of bladder cancer that has been observed in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. Other risk factors for bladder cancer, such as smoking and occupational exposures, did not explain the excess risk in this region.</p>

<p>Job Exposure Matrices (JEMs) are an efficient way to assign exposure estimates in population-based studies and may be the only exposure assessment option when only job and industry are available for study participants. DCEG investigators develop methods to improve JEMs by incorporating databases of exposure measurements to calibrate JEMs across time and across jobs and industries. For example, in the Shanghai Women's Health Study, investigators developed a novel framework to systematically combine a JEM with historical measurements to calibrate JEM exposure ratings used to estimate historical benzene and lead exposure.</p>

<p>Occupation- and industry-specific modules ask detailed questions about work activities and exposures within its population-based case-control studies to better capture within-occupation differences in exposure. Usually these module responses are reviewed job-by-job by an exposure assessor to assign exposure estimates. DCEG investigators in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) develop methods to more efficiently and transparently assign exposure in studies that use modules and examine the validity and reliability of these methods. Decision rules that link questionnaire responses to exposure estimates have been developed to assess occupational exposures in U.S. case-control studies, including metalworking fluids, diesel exhaust, lead and benzene.</p>
<p>In an evaluation of the reliability of decision rule approaches,&nbsp;investigators&nbsp;found that decision rule estimates of occupational diesel exhaust exposure for the New England Bladder Cancer Study had moderately-high agreement with estimates obtained from expert reviews of each job. Exposure estimates in the decision rules are data-driven wherever possible, including use of subjects&rsquo; answers to occupation and industry-specific modules and use of job group medians derived from module responses to assign exposure to those in similar jobs without a completed module. Intensity estimates are based on synthesis of publicly available data sources whenever possible (see next section).&nbsp;Investigators have also developed a method to extract patterns in the questionnaire responses that predict an expert&rsquo;s exposure assignments using classification and regression tree (CART) models. The extracted decision rules have been used to improve the transparency and efficiency of applying the exposure decisions to other study subjects.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators study geographic patterns and temporal trends in cancer incidence and mortality rates to generate etiologic hypotheses, evaluate consistency with other hypotheses, and identify cancer sites warranting special study. DCEG published a U.S. atlas of cancer mortality data spanning the years 1950 to 1994, which identified geographic areas with high rates of specific cancers and spatial and temporal patterns that may suggest particular carcinogenic exposures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The atlas was subsequently developed into an interactive website, and was updated over the years.

<p>DCEG researchers in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB) have been at the forefront of research into the association between vitamin D and cancer risk. While experimental data demonstrate a range of anti-carcinogenic effects for vitamin D, the epidemiological evidence has been inconsistent. MEB research includes prospective analyses of vitamin D status, as measured by circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D], the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, and vitamin D binding protein, the major vitamin D transporter in circulation; vitamin D genetic score analyses; and cell culture experiments of biological mechanisms. In addition, MEB researchers have been examining vitamin D and prostate cancer risk in populations of African ancestry, an understudied group who are at particularly increased risk of prostate cancer. Our research has found that higher vitamin D status is associated with a reduced risk of colorectal cancer and possibly bladder cancer, and with higher risk of prostate cancer, with no association for most other cancer sites, including breast cancer.</p>
<p>MEB researchers have played integral roles in several large collaborative pooling projects investigating vitamin D-cancer associations. For example, the Vitamin D Pooling Project of Rarer Cancers showed no association between circulating 25(OH)D within 10 cohorts and risk of cancers of the endometrium, kidney, ovary, stomach, or esophagus, or non-Hodgkin lymphoma, but did show significantly elevated pancreatic cancer risk with circulating 25(OH)D greater than 100 nmol/L. The Lung Cancer Cohort Consortium found no association between 25(OH)D and lung cancer risk in 20 cohorts. MEB researchers are also involved with lead roles in other pooling projects examining vitamin D, including the Circulating Biomarkers and Breast and Colorectal Cancer Consortium and the Endogenous Hormones and Nutritional Biomarkers Prostate Cancer Consortium.</p>

<p>Investigators in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB) conduct a synergistic, cutting-edge prostate cancer research program focused on increasing our understanding of the causes of this cancer as well as discovering and validating predictive biomarkers for clinical translation. Central themes include endogenous and exogenous sex steroid hormones, micronutrients and vitamin supplementation, reproductive factors, tissue-based biomarkers, and metabolomics, as well as examination of racial differences.</p>
<p>MEB investigators focus on studying identifiable subsets of clinically-relevant prostate cancer (e.g., aggressive and lethal forms) to ensure clinical relevance and avoid dilution of associations by indolent prostate cancers. They use state-of-the-art methods and novel approaches, drawing upon the distinct features of the Intramural Research Program and collaborating with expert extramural groups around the world.</p>

<p>MEB investigators continue to study prostate cancer trends and the basis of racial differences in this disease. Recentl studies include U.S. incidence trends of lethal prostate cancer, U.S. current trends and future projections of metastatic prostate cancer, and international trends in prostate cancer incidence. They are making full use of the Ghana Prostate Study, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Trial, the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study, AARP Diet and Health Study, and other intramural/extramural resources and collaborations to study racial differences in prostate cancer risks, assessing questionnaire data, germline genetics, serum, and tissue. For example, black-white differences in prostate cancer risk factor profiles were found for height and vitamin D intake, whereas lower risk in diabetic men was common to both races. The recently formed Prostate Cancer Cohort Consortium (PC3) within the <a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/cohort.html">NCI Cohort Consortium</a> will provide additional collaborations to further their assessments of racial differences in prostate cancer risks.</p>
<h4>Micronutrients and Vitamin Supplementation</h4>
<p>MEB investigators have aggressively pursued the etiologic role of vitamins D, E and A in prostate cancer. Their studies of vitamin D include measurement of both the accepted biomarker of vitamin D status, 25-hydroxy-vitamin D [25(OH)D], and its major carrier protein, vitamin D binding protein (DBP). A large investigation in the ATBC Study showed significantly elevated risk among men with higher circulating vitamin D, which is now an accepted association supported by analyses of vitamin D genetic variants and polygenic scores from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). By contrast, higher vitamin D status is associated with improved prostate cancer survival. Investigators are examining biological mechanisms through cross-sectional analyses of hormones in the&nbsp;National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and through ChIP-Seq cell culture functional experiments testing the effect of exposure to vitamin D and DHT on key nuclear receptors (i.e., AR, VDR, RAR/RXR) and gene regulation.<br /><br />The 32% reduction in prostate cancer incidence in the &alpha;-tocopherol (50 IU/day) arm of the ATBC Study was the basis of investigators' research into vitamin E. Their lines of inquiry focus on dose levels, smoking status, tocopherol fractions, mechanisms, and cancer stage, as well as whether genetic variants contributing to vitamin E status play some role. In the Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) trial, higher prostate cancer incidence in men receiving 400 IU of vitamin E daily raised questions concerning supra-physiological supplementation and cancer stage-specific mechanisms for vitamin E and other micronutrients. Investigators have shown improved 20-year survival in cases with higher baseline vitamin E status and those receiving the ATBC 50 IU dose, and an impact of vitamin E on androgens and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) consistent with tumor growth inhibition. They have also shown a direct association between circulating retinol and prostate cancer risk in their studies and in the EHNPCCG consortium.</p>
<h4>Metabolomics</h4>
<p>Metabolomic profiling is a relatively new laboratory methodology that simultaneously measures thousands of low molecular weight biochemicals (i.e., &lt;1kDa) in blood and other biospecimens. MEB investigators have conducted untargeted studies of prostate cancer risk, similar to other agnostic, &ldquo;broad spectrum&rdquo; research approaches such as GWAS, to discover biologically-based etiologic metabolites. Their initial investigations have identified strong lipid signals, including glycerophospholipids, sphingomyelins, and inositols, related to aggressive and lethal prostate cancer. By contrast, they found N-oleolyltaurine and androgens associated with prostate cancer survival, and have leveraged these studies to examine overall and cause-specific mortality.</p>
<h4>Sex Steroid Hormones and Reproductive Factors</h4>
<p>MEB investigators have conducted various studies of sex steroid hormones, reproductive factors, and prostate cancer. For example, they have provided evidence that the estrogen-androgen balance may be important in the development of aggressive prostate cancer and they have provided evidence that circulating measures of sex steroid hormones may be poor proxies of the intraprostatic milieu. Investigators continue to assess other proxies of sex steroid hormones such as male pattern baldness (androgenic alopecia), vasectomy, infertility, sexually transmitted infections as well as assessment of methods to quantitate sex hormones in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded prostate biopsy tissues. They have worked closely in collaboration with the Endogenous Hormones, Nutritional Biomarkers and Prostate Cancer Collaborative Group (University of Oxford, U.K.) to discover multiple new findings of prostate cancer etiology through the combined statistical power of more than a dozen cohorts, investigating the role of hormones, growth factors, diabetes, and micronutrients. They are also interested in the effects of exogeneous testosterone on prostate cancer risk.</p>
<h4>Tissue-based Markers for Prognostication</h4>
<p><em>TMPRSS2-ERG</em> brings together an androgen-responsive promoter (<em>TMPRSS2</em>) and an oncogene (<em>ERG</em>), resulting in overexpression of a functional chimeric ERG protein. MEB investigators have assessed this gene fusion&mdash;which is observed in a significant number of prostate cancers&mdash;in the Ghana Prostate Study as well as in a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess racial differences. Negative ERG staining was associated with higher Gleason score in Ghana, while the meta-analysis showed the prevalence of <em>TMPRSS2-ERG</em> fusions in prostate cancer to be highest in men of European descent (49%) followed by Asian (27%) and then African (25%). Investigators are currently conducting studies of intra-prostatic cell cycle proteins and mitotic tissue proteins in relation to the risk of prostate cancer recurrence in the PLCO study. They are also currently conducting studies of computational pathology in an attempt to improve prognostic algorithms.</p>

<p>The Ghana Prostate Study is designed to assess the burden, risk factor profiles and biomarkers of prostate cancer in Ghanaian men. In the United States, incidence rates of prostate cancer in African-Americans are 1.6-fold higher than those observed in European Americans, yet the causes of this difference remain unknown. Since West Africa is the principal ancestral origin of a substantial proportion of African-American men, one may hypothesize that genetic susceptibility loci that vary in allele frequency by ancestral population could account for part of the observed differences in prostate cancer rates within the U.S. In addition, little is known about the prostate cancer risk factors in African men.

<h4>Prostate Cancer in the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention (ATBC) Study</h4>
<p>The ATBC Study has been an integral male cohort research resource for NCI for nearly three decades. The trial was designed to test hypotheses based on epidemiological and experimental evidence supporting nutritional prevention of cancer, and tested supplementation with &beta;-carotene (20 mg/day) and vitamin E (50 mg/day, as dl-&alpha;-tocopheryl acetate) for 5-8 years in 29,133 male smokers (&gt;5 cigarettes daily), finding a 32% and 40% reduction in prostate cancer incidence and mortality, respectively, in the vitamin E arm. Currently, 2,900 prostate cancers have been ascertained and serum etiologic studies have focused on growth factors, insulin, thyroxine, sex hormones, vitamins D, E, and A, and metabolomic profiling. ATBC has actively contributed to several prostate cancer consortia including BPC3, EHNPCCG, and PRACTICAL. The study has published nearly 100 prostate cancer research studies.</p>
<h4>Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial</h4>
<p>The PLCO Study enrolled 76,683 men aged 55 to 74 years during 1993&ndash;2001 from ten cancer screening centers across the United States. For the prostate component, men were randomly assigned to usual care with opportunistic screening or to annual screening with prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing at baseline and for a further six years (with optional annual digital rectal exam at baseline and for a further four years). Participants were followed for incident cancer diagnoses and cause-specific mortality. All men were uncompensated volunteers from the general population with no prior medical history of any cancer (except nonmelanoma skin cancer). Men were excluded for prior removal of their prostate gland, participation in another cancer screening or prevention trial, Finasteride use within six months prior to enrollment, and&mdash;starting in 1995 after a study protocol change&mdash;if they had received more than one PSA test in the three-year period prior to enrollment. MEB investigators have leveraged this prospective cohort study to test various hypotheses related to prostate cancer pathogenesis and prognosis, including assessment of questionnaire data, baseline and follow-up blood samples, and tissue microarrays for a subset of men who underwent radical prostatectomy.</p>

<p><a href="https://epi.grants.cancer.gov/PanScan/">PanScan</a> is a multi-stage genome-wide association study (GWAS) of pancreatic cancer conducted within the framework of the NCI Cohort Consortium. Investigators have conducted three GWAS phases, PanScan I, II and III, and a meta-analysis with the <a href="http://panc4.org/">Pancreatic Cancer Case-Control Consortium (PanC4)</a> GWAS that collectively have led to the discovery of 20 genomic signals associated with risk for pancreatic cancer. Additional epidemiologic and genetic studies using data from these initial studies are now underway.</p>
<p>The next phase of the project will analyze additional pancreatic cancer cases from multiple cohorts, case-control, population-based, and biobank studies&mdash;including those from PanScan I-III&mdash;to discover novel regions of the genome associated with pancreatic cancer susceptibility.</p>

<h2>Elucidating Etiologic Heterogeneity, Current Patterns, and Future Trends</h2>
<p>DCEG investigators developed a broad-ranging, multi-faceted program of descriptive studies with major themes including the evaluation of tumor heterogeneity, current and future trends, and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=8&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302509" sys_contentid="302509" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302509" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7275127" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418">second cancers</a>. Recent highlights include:</p>
<p>&bull; One of the first demonstrations of breast cancer heterogeneity by hormone receptor expression, as well as novel projections of breast cancer trends by estrogen receptor status was evaluated using <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/">SEER</a> data.</p>
<p>&bull; A series of studies that showed a major emerging role for human papillomavirus (HPV) infection in the epidemiology of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, especially among men. Novel projections that DCEG investigators developed for those studies have influenced key policy deliberations pertaining to HPV vaccination of boys in the U.S.</p>
<h4>Future Goals</h4>
<p>Investigators will continue to explore population heterogeneity, racial disparity, geographic variation, and international patterns through three key strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Comprehensive comparative analyses of incidence, mortality, and survival patterns for subtypes of many common and less common malignancies;</li>
<li>Analyses of time trends, calendar-period and birth-cohort effects, risk factor patterns, molecular data, and incidence of new malignancies among cancer survivors;</li>
<li>Extensive extramural collaborative efforts with the American Cancer Society (ACS), International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Danish Breast Cancer Cooperative Group (DBCG), prioritizing studies of breast, ovary, and head and neck cancers.</li>

<p>DCEG research into the associations of radiation exposure and cancer has had significant impacts in the following areas:</p>
<h3>Medical Radiation from Therapeutic and Diagnostic Procedures</h3>
<p>DCEG radiation epidemiologists have contributed greatly to the advancement of medical practice through their study of ionizing radiation from therapeutic and diagnostic procedures.</p>
<p><img class="right" alt="" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=462457" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7277292" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="462457" rxinlineslot="104" height="194" width="291" />DCEG experts employed statistical models to estimate future cancer risks associated with radiation exposure from computed tomography (CT) scans. As a result, the NIH adopted a requirement that makers of CT scanners used at NIH facilities incorporate software to measure and track patients&rsquo; radiation doses over time. This patient protection policy is being adopted by other hospitals and imaging facilities (Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Recent work in this field has identified small but statistically increased risks of leukemia and brain tumors in the first decade after CT exposure in children (Pearce et al., 2012). <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=463653" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7277293" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="463653" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="463653">More information on CT exposure in children</a></p>
<p>DCEG researchers studying children treated for cancer with radiotherapy demonstrated a dose-response relationship: i.e., the higher the radiation dose the children received, the higher the risk that they would develop a second cancer, notably bone sarcoma and thyroid cancer. These findings spurred the medical community to decrease doses of radiotherapy in children. (Tucker et al., 1987, 1991)</p>
<p>Medical practice has been altered to reduce radiation exposure and intensify second cancer screening after DCEG researchers identified the striking dose-related risk of radiation-related second cancers among children treated for retinoblastoma (Kleinerman et al., 2005) in the <a href="http://rbstudy.cancer.gov/">Retinoblastoma Follow-up Study</a>.</p>
<p>After investigators reported that bone marrow recipients showed elevated risk of radiation-related solid cancers (Curtis et al., 1997; Socie et al., 2000; Rizzo et al., 2009), conditioning regimens used to prepare patients prior to stem cell transplantation were shifted from radiation to chemotherapy-based regimens.</p>
<p>DCEG investigators created a <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=31&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=13362" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="13362" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7277297" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="13362">professional education brochure</a> in collaboration with the Society for Pediatric Radiology as part of an effort to minimize the level of radiation from CT scans to children.</p>
<p>DCEG research quantified the dose response for risk of lung and breast cancers in patients treated with radiation for Hodgkin lymphoma (Tucker et al., 1988; Travis et al., 2002, 2003). This information influenced clinical standards to reduce radiation fields, lower exposures, and advise patients to avoid smoking.</p>

<h3>Radioactive Fallout or Environmental Contamination from Nuclear Weapons</h3>
<p>National and international radiation safety standards have been influenced by findings from DCEG studies of cancer and leukemia among atomic bomb survivors and pooled analyses of radiation-related risk of thyroid cancer from studies of other exposed populations. (Ron et al., 1994, 1995, 1998; Land et al., 1995, 1996, 2003).</p>
<p>When adjudicating personnel claims for compensation due to exposure to ionizing radiation on the job, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health and the Veterans Administration have used statistical models and a Web-based interactive program developed by DCEG to estimate the probability that a given cancer in an individual was induced by given exposures to ionizing radiation. (NIH, 1985, 2003; Kocher et al., 2008)</p>
<p>DCEG investigators reported on the potential health risks of exposure to radioactive I-131 fallout from above-ground nuclear testing that occurred in Nevada in the 1950s and 1960s (NCI, 1997; Gilbert et al., 1998). A national educational campaign aimed at informing the public was initiated based on information in these reports. <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/causes-prevention/risk-factors/radiation/i-131">More information on radioactive I-131 from fallout</a>.</p>
<h3>Naturally-occurring Radiation</h3>
<p>Radon, a radioactive gas formed by the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water, can cause lung cancer. This exposure can be especially hazardous indoors where it can become more concentrated. DCEG researchers quantified lung cancer risks associated with occupational and residential exposures to radon. These findings were critical to the formulation of radon mitigation guidelines issued by policymakers at the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Qiao et al., 1989; Lubin et al., <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2293552">1</a>990, 1997, 1998, 2004; Alavanja et al., 1994, 1999; Wang et al., 2002).</p>
<h3>Ultraviolet Radiation</h3>
<p>It is generally accepted that if ozone levels in the earth&rsquo;s stratosphere are depleted, greater amounts of shortwave ultraviolet radiation will reach the earth's surface, resulting in increased skin cancer. DCEG researchers provided the U.S. EPA with estimates of increases in melanoma and other skin cancers in relation to projected increases in ozone depletion. These estimates were based on analyses of data from surveys of ground-level ultraviolet radiation in relation to time trends for melanoma and other skin cancers (Scotto et al., 1975, 1981; Fears et al., 1976, 1977, 1983).</p>
<h3>Electromagnetic Fields</h3>
<p>DCEG researchers conducted the first study of cellular telephones; they found no association with increased risk of brain tumors. This finding informed U.S. Food and Drug Administration&rsquo;s regulatory policies on radiofrequency radiation (Inskip et al., 2001). In continued followup of this exposure, investigators reported, in 2012, that <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2012/GliomaCellPhoneUse">incidence trends have remained roughly constant for glioma</a>, the main type of brain cancer hypothesized to be related to cell phone use. They found that while cell phone use increased substantially over the period 1992 to 2008 (from nearly zero to almost 100 percent of the population), the U.S. trends in glioma incidence did not mirror that increase (Little MP 2012). Results of this study were published online March 8, 2012, in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302468" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7277296" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302468" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302468">Learn about our current research on cellular phones and brain tumors</a>.</p>
<p>DCEG researchers demonstrated no increased risk for childhood leukemia associated with residential exposure to magnetic fields generated by nearby power lines. This information formed the basis of judicial rulings in the United Kingdom and elsewhere on the potential health effects of these exposures (Linet et al., 1997).</p>

<p>Over the years, DCEG research on the association between occupational exposures and cancer has made a significant impact in the following areas:</p>

<p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) classified <b>diesel exhaust</b> as carcinogenic to humans largely based on results from the Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study, which played a pivotal role in the 2012 IARC evaluation. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303765" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="303765" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7277160" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303765">More information about diesel exhaust and cancer risk</a></p>

<p>A U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) rule limiting the <b>benzene</b> content in gasoline and requiring controls on passenger vehicles and portable fuel containers to reduce pollutants was informed by DCEG research showing evidence of hematotoxicity from benzene exposure at levels below the occupational standard at the time (Lan et al., 2004). This research also resulted in a lower action level in China. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303764" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303764" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7277156" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303764">More information on benzene-associated hematoxicity and carcinogenicity</a></p>

This research also led to the EPA establishing regulatory standards for formaldehyde. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=21&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303671" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303671" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7277158" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303671">More information about DCEG research on formaldehyde exposure</a></p>

<p>The U.S. EPA and IARC evaluated <b>trichloroethylene</b> and concluded that there was sufficient evidence for carcinogenicity in humans. Results from the DCEG cohort study of civilian workers at Hill Air Force Base (Blair et al., 1998; Radican et al., 2008) and the Eastern European kidney cancer case-control study (Moore et al., 2010) provided evidence on cancer risks and genetic susceptibility. A DCEG cross-sectional molecular epidemiology study of healthy workers exposed to trichloroethylene found evidence of both immunotoxicity and kidney toxicity (Lan et al., 2010; Hosgood et al., 2011; Vermeulen et al., 2012).</p>

<p>IARC classified <b>tetrachloroethylene</b> as a probable human carcinogen.&#160;Results from the DCEG study of dry cleaners provided important findings for this conclusion (Blair et al., 1990).</p>

<p><img alt="" class="right" height="190" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=462460" sys_dependentid="462460" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="7277155" sys_siteid="475" width="142" />IARC classified airborne <b>arsenic</b> as a human carcinogen, and the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration established new exposure limits for arsenic, following DCEG research that found excess risk of respiratory cancer among copper smelter workers (Lee and Fraumeni, 1969) and nearby residents (Blot and Fraumeni, 1975) exposed to inorganic arsenic.</p>

<p>IARC concluded that there was insufficient evidence (group 3) to classify <b>acrylonitrile</b> as a human carcinogen.&#160;The DCEG cohort was a major study providing information for this conclusion (Blair et al., 1998; Stewart et al., 1998).</p>

<p>IARC classified <b>wood dust</b> exposure as a human carcinogen after studies showed increased nasal cancer among furniture workers (Brinton et al., 1977, 1984).</p>

<p>The U.S. EPA established label instructions to change clothes after <b>2,4-D</b> application, and the Veterans Administration adjusted compensation policies for exposure to <b>Agent Orange</b>, after a DCEG report showed increased lymphoma risk associated with 2,4-D exposure (Hoar et al., 1986).</p>

<p>IARC classified <b>chromium</b> compounds as carcinogenic after DCEG research showed an excess of lung cancer reported among chromium pigment workers (Hayes et al., 1989).</p>

<p>IARC classified <b>silica</b> as a human carcinogen, citing DCEG studies of silica-exposed miners and workers in pottery factories and dusty trades (Chen et al., 1989, 1990, 1992; Amandus et al., 1991, 1995).</p>

<p>DCEG studies of pesticides including <b>trifluralin</b> (Cantor et al., 1992), <b>atrazine</b> (Hoar et al., 1986; Freeman et al., 2011), <b>dichlorvos</b> (Brown et al., 1990), <b>DDT</b> and <b>lindane</b> (Alavanja et al., 2014), <b>diazinon</b> (Jones et al., 2015) and&#160;<b>chlordane</b> (Brown et al., 1990, 1993; Cantor et al., 1992; Pesatori et al., 1994) were used by IARC and the U.S. EPA in their determinations of carcinogenicity.</p>

This finding was confirmed by expert panels convened in the United States, the United Kingdom, and other countries, providing further confidence in the safety of water fluoridation (Hoover et al., 1976).</p>

<p>Water suppliers often add disinfectants to drinking water to eliminate disease-causing organisms, or pathogens. These disinfectants react with naturally-occurring organic material in the water to form <b>disinfection byproducts</b>, which may pose health risks. The Environmental Protection Agency lowered the allowable maximum allowable levels for two groups of disinfection byproducts, <b>trihalomethanes</b> and <b>haloacetic acids</b>, in drinking water, after a DCEG study linked them to elevated bladder cancer risk (Cantor et al., 1987).&#160;</p>

<p>DCEG research on <b>dietary and drinking water nitrate</b> contributed to the International Agency for Research on Cancer monograph review (2010) of ingested nitrate and nitrite and cyanobacterial peptides (Ward et al., 1996, 2000, 2007; DeRoos et al., 2003; Coss et al., 2004).&#160;Ingested nitrate and nitrite was determined to be possibly carcinogenic to humans (2A).</p>

<p><img width="153" height="203" class="right" alt="" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=462989" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7313013" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="462989" rxinlineslot="104" />As early as the mid-1970s DCEG researchers observed that <b>menopausal hormone therapy</b> was associated with increased breast cancer risk&mdash;and that the risk was greater with estrogen-progestin regimens than with estrogen alone (Hoover et al., 1976; Schairer et al., 2000). In the early 2000s, data from the Women&rsquo;s Health Initiative confirmed this observation and resulted in a fundamental shift in medical practice. The change in use of menopausal hormone therapy resulted in a decrease in breast cancer incidence.</p>
<p><b>Diethylstilbestrol (DES)</b> is the first carcinogen to have been shown to cross the placenta and cause cancer in the offspring. Between 1940 and the early 1970s, millions of pregnant women were given DES, the first synthetic estrogen, in the mistaken belief that it would prevent complications of pregnancy. Long-term follow-up of cohorts exposed prenatally to DES revealed a broader spectrum of adverse health outcomes than previously known. These findings have affected medical surveillance of exposed persons and have sparked research on the effects of early-life chemical exposures beyond DES (Hatch et al., 1998, 2001, 2011; Titus-Ernstoff et al., 2001, 2010; Troisi et al., 2007a, 2007b; Hoover et al., 2011). <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=5&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=463618" sys_contentid="463618" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7313015" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="463618" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418">More information on DES</a></p>
<p>DCEG researchers found evidence that <b>ovulation-stimulating agents</b> used in fertility treatments do not significantly increase the risk of ovarian and other cancers (Brinton, Lamb et al., 2004; Brinton, Scoccia, et al., 2004), which has reduced concern about prescribing these increasingly popular drugs.</p>
<h3>Treatment-related Therapy</h3>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) released warnings and cancer screening recommendations for transplant patients after a DCEG study quantified the increased risks of lymphoma and certain other cancers associated with <b>immunosuppressive drugs</b> in transplant recipients (Hoover and Fraumeni, 1973).</p>
<p><img width="159" height="240" class="right" alt="" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=462990" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7313014" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="462990" rxinlineslot="104" />DCEG researchers found evidence showing an excess risk of leukemia among women treated with <b>chlorambucil</b> for ovarian cancer (Greene et al., 1982). This finding was key to the International Agency for Research on Cancer classifying the drug as a human carcinogen and to FDA releasing clinical alerts to curtail its use.</p>
<p>In a study of leukemia after childhood cancer, DCEG researchers found a dose-response relationship with <b>alkylating agent chemotherapy</b>, after adjusting for radiation (Tucker et al., 1987). This finding led to decreased use of these agents for the treatment of childhood cancer.</p>
<p>DCEG researchers found a dose-response risk of childhood leukemia following treatment with <b>chloramphenicol</b> (Shu et al., 1987). As a result of this and other evidence, chloramphenicol is no longer the first-line agent for any infection in developed countries.</p>
<p>A DCEG study of secondary leukemia after treatment for breast cancer affected clinical practice by demonstrating the substantial risk associated with <b>melphalan</b> and the relative safety of the current <b>cyclophosphamide</b>-based chemotherapy regimens (Curtis et al., 1992).</p>
<h3>Medical Devices</h3>
<p>DCEG&rsquo;s studies of silicone <b>breast implants</b> supplied evidence the devices did not cause an increase in breast cancer or connective tissue disorders (Brinton, et al., 2004, 2006). These findings provided welcome reassurance to consumers over FDA&rsquo;s decision to allow implants back on the market.</p>

<p>The monographs outline current understandings of cancer hazards from particular viruses based on a large body of scientific research. Investigators in DCEG&rsquo;s <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=55&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302590" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302590" sys_relationshipid="7276314" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="302590">Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB)</a> produced a considerable portion of the evidence cited in the NTP reports. DCEG investigators study the role of viruses in cancer using techniques from molecular epidemiology to linkages of cancer and virus registries. Supported by DCEG research, the NTP&rsquo;s results influence public health policies by regulatory bodies such as the CDC.</p>

<h4>Negative HPV Test Result is Better Predictor of Low Cervical Cancer Risk than Negative Pap Test</h4>
<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) is the cause of nearly all cervical cancers. Newer approaches to cervical cancer screening test for DNA (or RNA) of HPV at the cervix, whereas the Pap test detects abnormal cell changes associated with the development of cancer. Co-testing is now recommended for most women but clinicians were still unsure of the reassurance from a negative HPV test. Based on a study that included more than 1 million women, investigators at the National Cancer Institute, led by <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/gage-julia">Julia C. Gage, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>, determined that a negative test for HPV infection compared to a negative Pap test provides greater safety, or assurance, against future risk of cervical cancer. These findings provide evidence to support the currently recommended cotesting strategy with HPV and Pap, as well as the possibility of primary HPV testing as another alternative for cervical screening.<b> </b><a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/news-events/research-news-highlights/2014/negative-hpv-test">Read more about this study</a>.<b> Reference:</b> Gage JC, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25038467">Reassurance against future risk of precancer and cancer conferred by a negative HPV test</a>. <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2014;106(8):pii:dju153.</p>
<h4>Further Evidence <i>H. pylori</i> Treatment Reduces Gastric Cancer Incidence and Mortality</h4>
<p>Infection with <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> (<i>H. pylori</i>) &mdash;a bacterium found in the stomach&mdash;is a major cause of gastric cancer. Approximately two-thirds of the world&rsquo;s population harbors the bacterium, with infection rates much higher in developing countries. Treatment of the infection with antibiotics had been shown in intervention trials to lower gastric cancer incidence when compared to placebo. Lowered gastric cancer mortality was also suggested. But benefits in older people and those with advanced precancerous lesions were unknown. NCI investigator <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/K-N/gail-mitchell">Mitchell H. Gail, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, and collaborators found that a two-week course of <i>H. pylori</i> treatment given 15 years earlier was associated with lower gastric cancer incidence and mortality in older adults (aged 55 years and older at the beginning of the study). Incidence, but not mortality, was also statistically significantly reduced in subjects with advanced precancerous lesions initially. <i>H. pylori</i> treatment can benefit an entire population, not just the young or those with mild precancerous lesions in the stomach. <b>Reference: </b>Li WQ, et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925350">Effects of </a><i><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925350">Helicobacter pylori</a></i><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925350"> treatment on gastric cancer incidence and mortality in subgroups</a>. <i>J Natl Cancer Inst</i> 2014;106(7):pii:dju116.</p>

<p>Starting in the 1980s, DCEG investigators carried out landmark studies on the natural history of cervical cancer that firmly established HPV as the necessary cause of this malignancy (Schiffman et al., 1993, 2007). Their efforts laid the groundwork for vaccine development and improved strategies for screening.</p>
<h4>Efficacy of HPV Vaccines &ndash; Doses</h4>
<p>The licensure of prophylactic HPV vaccines in the mid-2000s created the opportunity to reduce a large fraction of the disease burden of cervical cancer. However, the cost and logistical challenges of administering a three-dose regimen created a barrier to vaccinating adolescents. DCEG investigators reported that one or two doses of an HPV 16/18 vaccine may prevent cervical cancer just as effectively as three doses (Kreimer et al., 2011, 2015). Such an approach could lower the cost of vaccination and encourage the global dissemination of the vaccine.</p>
<p>In October 2016, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a two-dose regimen of the nonavalent HPV vaccine for adolescents ages 9 through 14. Shortly after, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended a two dose regimen for all prophylactic HPV vaccines given to children ages 9 to 14, while keeping the 3 dose regimen for those 15 or older. This decision was based on a review of evidence from randomized clinical trials and other studies, including research conducted by DCEG investigators. <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2016/hpv-vaccine-doses">Read more about the two-dose CDC recommendation at Cancer.gov</a>.</p>
<h4>Efficacy of HPV Vaccines &ndash; Non-Cervical Sites</h4>
<p>DCEG investigators also reported that the HPV 16/18 vaccine provides strong protection against anal HPV infections that could eventually lead to anal cancer (Kreimer et al., 2011).</p>
<h4>HPV-based Screening for Cervical Cancer</h4>
<p>In 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and a coalition of health organizations published new guidelines for cervical cancer screening. DCEG studies into the use of HPV DNA testing and cytology to stratify women into accurate and precise risk categories&nbsp;(Katki et al., 2011) have informed these revised&nbsp;guidelines. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303768" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303768" sys_relationshipid="7276312" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="303768">More information on HPV and cervical cancer</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)">Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV)</h3>
<p>DCEG research provided the initial assessment of the specificity, sensitivity, and appropriate applications of the first-generation HIV antibody testing system for diagnosis of HIV infection (Weiss et al., 1985). As a result of this work, those tests became standard care in the routine clinical practice of diagnosing individuals thought to have contracted HIV.</p>
<p>A prospective study of HIV infection and the development of AIDS in subjects with hemophilia showed that a much larger proportion of HIV-infected persons would develop AIDS than previously thought (Goedert et al., 1989), a finding with broad impact for public health prevention programs and clinical practice.</p>
<p>DCEG research led to the recognition that CD4 count and HIV viral load predict risk for the development of full-blown AIDS and death from AIDS (Goedert et al., 1987, 1989; Ehmann et al., 1994; O&rsquo;Brien et al., 1996). These biomarkers are now the standard measures used to inform routine clinical care of HIV-positive patients, including counseling, screening, and medication management.</p>
<p>New worker safety recommendations for the handling of concentrated HIV samples in the laboratory were influenced by a DCEG study of HIV infection among laboratory workers (Weiss et al., 1988).</p>
<p>DCEG biostatisticians applied novel statistical methods to derive estimates of HIV prevalence in the U.S. population. Their findings revealed that prevalence was greatest among heterosexual individuals (Rosenberg et al., 1991; Rosenberg, 1995; Rosenberg and Biggar, 1998).</p>
<h3 id="Other Infectious Agents">Other Infectious Agents</h3>
<p>U.S. poliovirus vaccines were accidentally contaminated with simian virus 40 (SV40). These contaminated doses were widely administered from l955 through 1962. The public was alarmed by the possible risks from exposure to this oncogenic virus. DCEG investigators published results from after a study of newborns who received SV40-contaminated polio vaccine showing no increased risk of cancer (Fraumeni et al., 1963; Fraumeni et al., 1970; Mortimer et al., 1981).</p>
<p>The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended screening all blood donations for human T-cell leukemia virus type I and II (HTLV-I/II) antibodies, based on DCEG research that demonstrated increased risks of HTLV-1 and associated complications following exposure to HTLV-I/II in contaminated blood (Blattner et al., 1982; Blayney et al., 1983).</p>
<p>The FDA decided not to screen the U.S. blood supply for human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) after DCEG research demonstrated that serological tests for HHV-8 had poor reproducibility (Rabkin et al., 1998).</p>
<p>DCEG studies linking <i>Helicobacter pylori</i> infection to the very high incidence of gastric cancer and precancerous lesions in Shandong province in China prompted a clinical trial that showed a sustained reduction in risk following a two-week course of antibiotics (You et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2006; Ma et al., 2012; Li et. al., 2014).</p>

<p>DCEG research on hereditary syndromes and cancer has made a significant impact in the following areas:</p>
<p><img width="150" height="160" class="right" alt="" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=463090" inlinetype="rximage" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7216960" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="463090" rxinlineslot="104" />DCEG researchers have identified <b>genes</b> and <b>mutations</b> responsible for hereditary cancer syndromes. These findings have had a significant impact on the clinical management of these and related conditions, as well as informed research on the genetic determinates of cancer in general. Examples include the discovery of <b>Li-Fraumeni syndrome</b> and the role of <i>p53</i> (Li and Fraumeni, 1969, 1982; Li et al., 1988; Malkin et al., 1990) and the roles of <i>NF2</i> in <b>neurofibromatosis type 2</b> (Rouleau et al., 1993; Trofatter et al., 1993); <i>CDKN2A</i>, <i>CDK4</i>, <i>MITF</i>, and <i>POT1</i> in <b>hereditary melanoma</b> (Hussusian et al., 1994; Zuo et al., 1996; Yokoyama et al., 2011; Shi et al., 2014); <i>PTCH</i> in <b>nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome</b> (Hahn et al., 1996); <i>SUFU</i> in <b>medulloblastoma</b> (Taylor et al., 2002); and <i>T</i> (brachyury) duplication in <b>familial chordoma</b> (Yang et al., 2009).</p>
<p>Detailed clinical studies of <b>neurofibromatosis type 2</b> carried out by DCEG investigators revealed heterogeneity of the disease phenotype, changed its clinical management, and informed genetic counseling guidelines (Kaiser-Kupfer et al., 1989; Parry et al., 1994, 1996; Ruttledge et al., 1996).</p>
<p>DCEG researchers identified the <i>PTCH</i> gene as the cause of <b>nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome</b> after discovering a novel chromosome 9q deletion in a patient with the syndrome and conducting genetic linkage and fine-mapping studies (Gailani et al., 1992; Hahn et al., 1996; Chidambaram et al., 1996). This work set in motion a research effort that recently culminated in the first U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved biological agent (vismodegib) to target the Hedgehog signaling pathway, a novel therapy for locally advanced and metastatic basal cell carcinoma of the skin.</p>
<p>DCEG researchers and colleagues published the <i><b>Concise Handbook of Familial Cancer Susceptibility Syndromes</b>,</i> which has provided a useful reference for clinical recognition and management of these rare but important disorders (Lindor and Greene, 1998; Lindor et al., 2008).</p>
<p>DCEG researchers observed that patients with <b>dyskeratosis congenita</b> (DC) have extremely <b>short telomeres</b> and that approximately 60 percent of DC patients have a germline mutation in a telomere biology gene.

<p>DCEG researchers developed the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/"><b>Gail breast cancer risk assessment model</b></a> (Gail et al., 1989) to estimate a woman's risk of developing invasive breast cancer. Since its original publication, the tool has been updated and expanded. It is widely used by clinicians and researchers. The Food and Drug Administration guidelines rely on the tool for the recommendation of use of <b>tamoxifen</b> and <b>raloxifene</b> for breast cancer risk reduction.</p>

<p>A DCEG study of <b><i>BRCA1</i></b> and <b><i>BRCA2</i></b> alterations in the Ashkenazi Jewish population of Washington, D.C., reported lower penetrance for breast and ovarian cancers than earlier studies in families with hereditary breast cancer. The findings highlighted the importance of population-specific founder mutations in genetic testing and affected the clinical management of mutation carriers (Struewing et al., 1997).</p>

<p>DCEG researchers conducted epidemiological studies using <b>tumor tissue microarrays</b> that revealed the heterogeneity of breast cancer in terms of risk factors and prognosis (García- Closas et al., 2006, 2008; Yang et al., 2007), which has enhanced clinical care decisions.</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>Diethylstilbestrol (DES) is the first carcinogen to have been shown to cross the placenta and cause cancer in the offspring. Between 1940 and the early 1970s millions of pregnant women were given DES, the first synthetic estrogen, in the mistaken belief that it would prevent complications of pregnancy. The earliest suggestion of a problem with DES was reported in a landmark publication in the NEJM that described a group of young women who had a rare vaginal cancer typically seen only in older women.</p>
<p>NCI researchers, led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349664" sys_contentid="349664" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1965" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7275651" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349664" rxinlineslot="103">Robert N. Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.,</a> developed the DES Follow-up Study in the mid-1990s, bringing together participants from four large clinical studies of DES-exposed and unexposed subjects conducted 20 years prior.</p>
<h3>Advance</h3>
<p>The DES Follow-up Study team located and re-contacted the women in the studies, and systematically followed them for long-term adverse health outcomes. In a landmark publication in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i> in late 2011, Dr. Hoover and his colleagues projected the burden of disease experienced by the millions women who were exposed in-utero. The authors report on 12 adverse health outcomes linked to DES exposure: infertility, spontaneous abortion, ectopic pregnancy, second trimester pregnancy loss, preeclampsia, preterm birth, stillbirth, neonatal death, natural menopause prior to age 45, cervical cancer, breast cancer after age 40, and clear-cell adenocarcinoma of the vagina and cervix.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Without the sustained follow-up of these women through the DES Follow-up Study, many of these outcomes would have been missed. The toll of the devastating health effects is unprecedented, particularly since DES was given to healthy individuals. This study has not only documented a public health disaster, but has served as the model for an entire area of research focused on the role of endocrine disruption in early life and subsequent health effects.</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>In the US, radiation exposure from medical sources has risen 600% in the last three decades, mainly as a result of a dramatic increase in the use of CT scans and other diagnostic tests that involve higher doses of ionizing radiation compared to conventional X-rays. &nbsp;These tests provide great medical benefits but also potential risks, including the risk of a radiation-related cancer. &nbsp;The overall public health impact of these trends in medical radiation exposures is not yet known. &nbsp;There are particular concerns about use in children because they are known to be more radiosensitive and radiation doses can be higher.</p>
<h3>Advance</h3>
<p>NCI researchers, led by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=23&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349642" sys_contentid="349642" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1965" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276404" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_dependentid="349642" rxinlineslot="103">Amy Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez, D.Phil.,</a> developed state-of-the-art radiation risk modeling tools and estimated that 29,000 future cancers could be related to the number of CT scans performed in a single year in the US. &nbsp;Results from a separate study&mdash;the first to directly study the cancer risks after CT scans in children&mdash;found that cumulative radiation dose from 2-3 head CT scans (based on current scanner settings) could triple the risk of developing brain tumors and 5-10 head CT scans could triple the risk of developing leukemia. However, these two malignancies are relatively rare, and the actual number of additional cases caused by radiation exposure from CT scans is small.</p>
<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>There is increasing recognition of the potential harms resulting from overuse of diagnostic tests. &nbsp;&nbsp;These studies have been cited by the FDA, American College of Radiology and other professional organizations as evidence of the need for clinical practice to change. &nbsp;The new direct evidence of subsequent cancer risks after CT scans in childhood could result in new guidelines for usage in children and technological innovations to reduce doses. &nbsp;</p>

<p>About half of the world&rsquo;s population is exposed to smoke from heating or cooking with solid fuels. Household air pollution (HAP) from solid fuel use was estimated to cause 4.3 million deaths in 2012 (7.7 percent&nbsp;of global mortality). To study the role of indoor air pollution from solid fuel use in lung cancer risk, particularly among never-smoking women, DCEG investigators conducted a series of investigations in Xuanwei County, China, where lung cancer rates among never-smoking women are among the highest in the world. A retrospective cohort study found that use of smoky coal relative to smokeless coal was associated with a 99-fold increase in lung cancer risk among women, almost all of whom were never-smokers. This represents one of the strongest effects of an environmental exposure reported for cancer risk in any population to date. To identify which components of coal combustion account for the striking increase in lung cancer risk in Xuanwei, and to characterize other important exposures, a new case-control study of never-smoking female lung cancer that includes an extensive exposure assessment component has been conducted to identify the components of coal combustion products that drive lung cancer risk in this population and the genetic variants that modify effects. New findings show that we can explain a substantial amount of the high lung cancer risk in this population based on exposure to a subgroup of compounds we have measured.</p>
<p>To expand the study of the environmental and genetic etiology of lung cancer among never-smoking women, we formed the Female Lung Cancer Consortium in Asia and conducted the first large-scale genome-wide association study (GWAS) of lung cancer among never-smoking females anywhere in the world. This study recently identified novel loci that have not been linked to lung cancer among smokers in either Asia or the West, and found evidence for gene-environment interactions with coal use for home cooking and heating. We are in the process of expanding the GWAS and also conducting whole genome sequencing of tumor samples from a subgroup of cases in the study.</p>

<p>Over the years, DCEG research on the effect of physical activity on cancer has made a significant impact in the following areas:</p>
<p><img alt="" class="right" inlinetype="rximage" rxinlineslot="104" src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=476522" sys_dependentid="476522" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_relationshipid="7277213" sys_siteid="475" height="152" width="229" />DCEG studies indicated a reduced risk of colon, breast, endometrial, and ovarian cancers associated with <b>physical activity</b> (Albanes et al., 1989; Chow et al., 1993; Dosemeci et al., 1993; Sturgeon et al., 1993; Zheng et al., 1993) and were cited in the 1996 <i>Surgeon General&rsquo;s Report on Physical Activity and Health</i>.</p>
<p>A DCEG study found that <b></b>leisure-time physical activity is associated with longer life expectancy, even at relatively low levels of activity and regardless of body weight, a finding that reinforces U.S. guidelines for physical activity for all Americans (Moore SC, et al., 2012).</p>
<p>Pooling data on 1.44 million people from 12 prospective U.S. and European cohorts, DCEG investigators, and colleagues, found that <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1424&amp;sys_contentid=1048295" sys_dependentvariantid="1424" sys_dependentid="1048295" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7277214" sys_variantid="1424" sys_contentid="1048295">leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks of 13 cancer types </a>(esophageal adenocarcinoma, liver, lung, kidney, gastric cardia, endometrial, myeloid leukemia, myeloma, colon, head and neck, rectal, bladder, and breast). Most of these associations were evident regardless of body mass index or smoking history (Moore et al 2016). These findings confirm and extend the evidence for a benefit of physical activity on cancer risk and support its role as a key component of population-wide cancer prevention and control efforts.</p>

<p>DCEG has been doing research into cervical and other HPV-related cancers for over 30 years. Several studies have led to advances in screening and clinical management. Cervical cancer etiology is better understood than the origins of most major malignancies. Within DCEG, several groups continue to study the most interesting and important research topics. Advances in understanding of HPV natural history and etiology have led in two major directions: (1) vaccinology and immunoepidemiology; and (2) screening and clinical management. It is this second direction that is based in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=42&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302430" sys_contentid="302430" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7317132" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302430" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1422">Clinical Genetics Branch</a>, because of the remarkable similarity between the HPV work and the analogous work related to familial cancer research. The HPV screening and clinical management area includes three major components:</p>
<ol>
<li>Exploration of remaining important topics in HPV natural history related to cervical multi-stage carcinogenesis</li>
<li>Study by intensive genomic and epigenetic approaches why certain HPV types and type variants are such powerful carcinogens while genetically-related types are not</li>
<li>Translation of natural history estimates into useful clinical risk prediction tools to guide cervical cancer prevention</li>

<p>This population-based natural history study of human papillomavirus (HPV) and cervical neoplasia was launched with Costa Rican colleagues in 1993 in the province of Guanacaste. Over 10,000 randomly selected women were followed longitudinally for seven years.&nbsp;The project yielded many insights into HPV natural history and the performance of then-novel HPV and cytologic screening techniques. Residual specimens are being used to study remaining natural history questions.</p>

<p>This study is designed to develop a cervical cancer risk prediction model incorporating clinical and laboratory covariates.&nbsp;The goal is to classify women&rsquo;s risks of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 2 (CIN 2), CIN 3, and cancer into strata upon which clinical management decisions can be based.&nbsp;Eight articles comprising a supplemental issue in the <i>Journal of Lower Genital Tract Disease</i> formed the early core of this effort. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In current work, risk data from multiple cohorts are being compiled. For example, we have confirmed in two other cohorts that HPV-positive ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) is equivalent to LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion), while HPV-negative ASC-US is equivalent to a normal pap result. Also, a negative HPV test provides greater reassurance against risk of cancer than a negative pap result. If HPV is negative, knowing that the pap is also negative provides only slight additional reassurance.</p>

<p>Pulling from specimens accumulated in cohort and case-control studies, we are examining the methylation of the HPV viral genome in relation to risk of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN 3) and cancer. As a general rule for multiple HPV types, increased methylation particularly of CpG sites in the <i>L1</i> gene is strongly associated with increased risk of CIN 3 and cancer. The goal is to understand the etiologic meaning and possible biomarker utility of viral (and cervical) gene methylation.</p>

<p>This project is designed to interrogate the relationship between sequence changes in the HPV genome and carcinogenicity. There is huge variability in risk of precancer and cancer conferred by different HPV types that is poorly explained. HPV type 16 is known to cause half of all cervical cancer cases worldwide, however the specific reason for its carcinogenicity has been elusive. The simple question is &ldquo;Why is HPV16 so uniquely carcinogenic?&rdquo; High-throughput, next-generation sequencing methods are being used to study HPV16 variant sub-lineages among women with cancer and cervical intraepithelial neoplasia 3 (CIN 3) in comparison to women with benign HPV infections. An Ampliseq/Ion Torrent-based assay for high-throughput whole-genome sequencing of HPV16 was developed in 2015 (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26645052">Cullen et al, 2015</a>).</p>
<p>The team has demonstrated the reliability, reproducibility, accuracy, and usefulness of this assay for HPV16 and expanded it to the other 13 carcinogenic types. A global, high-risk HPV genome sequencing method has been developed, and is being used to compare HPV16-related types to HPV16. Using the HPV16 assay, investigators sequenced the entire HPV16 genome in samples from over 3,200 infected women and classified the viruses into lineages and sublineages. Through this process they discovered considerable risk differences for precancer and cancer and identified specific variant sublineages that strongly influence HPV 16 carcinogenicity and histologic outcome&nbsp;(<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27130930">Mirabello et al, 2016</a>).</p>
<p>Further, investigators compared HPV16 genomic sequences between cases and controls and discovered that controls, who had benign infections, had infections with significantly more protein-changing variants throughout the genome, while cases had infections devoid of protein-changing variants particularly in the E7 oncogene (<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28886384">Mirabello et al, 2017</a>).&nbsp;These findings contribute to resolving the outstanding question of why common and typically benign HPV16 infections only sometimes cause cancer. Follow-up work on the potent carcinogenicity of an intact HPV16 E7 protein is underway.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additional case-control and prospective approaches are being used to determine how HPV genetic variation informs our understanding of carcinogenesis and influences risk for cancer. Studies are underway to evaluate all the HR-HPV types at the cervix and non-cervical sites, and evaluations of the interplay of host-viral genetics.</p>
<p>DCEG experts have also developed a novel Next-Generation Sequencing HPV genotyping assay based on their HPV genome sequencing. The new approach&nbsp;provides low-cost, high-throughput genotyping that will lead to major cost-savings for large cervical cancer screening and vaccination studies conducted by DCEG and other research groups since most current genotyping assays are expensive and laborious.&nbsp;</p>

<p>DCEG investigators teamed with Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) to create a repository of specimens with carcinogenic human papillomavirus (HPV) genotypes that would be useful for natural history studies of HPV typing, methylation, and HPV variant genomics. Since 2003, KPNC has routinely used an FDA-approved pooled-type DNA test for carcinogenic HPV&nbsp;(HC2) with cytology (&ldquo;cotesting&rdquo;) for cervical cancer screening in women 30 and older.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators have stored approximately 35,000 baseline specimens that have tested positive by HC2 and 5,000 specimens that have tested negative by HC2.&nbsp;They have genotyped specimens selected for testing based on clinical outcomes ascertained by linkage to the KPNC cytology and histology databases and KPNC's active yearly follow-up of all HC2-positive women. The investigators "followed" women for three years after enrollment ended in 2011 by banking their residual specimens collected at their return visits.&nbsp;The subsequent continuing follow-up has focused on incident precancer and cancer. At present, there are more than 110,000 stored specimens, with &gt;20,000 genotyped. The first prospective analyses have confirmed that HPV 16 detection confers a greatly elevated risk of subsequent precancer/cancer, while separate detection of other HPV types yields less clear clinical value.</p>

<p>Because telomeres are critical to chromosomal stability, the genes that code for proteins integral in telomere biology may be important in cancer etiology. DCEG investigators in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=42&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302430" sys_contentid="302430" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302430" sys_variantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7276120">Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB)</a> have shown that nucleotide diversity in genes coding for critical proteins in the telomere maintenance pathway is limited when compared with other types of genes. They are also highly conserved between species. Because these genes appear to be under evolutionary constraint, it is possible that germline genetic variation (i.e., single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in these genes could be a significant risk factor for cancer or other diseases.</p>
<p>Detailed population genetic studies of telomere biology genes in worldwide populations are underway. Several studies have been conducted by CGB investigators that found SNPs in telomere biology genes are associated with risk of certain cancers. SNPs have also been evaluated as regulators of telomere length through candidate gene and genome-wide association studies. Ongoing studies include fine mapping of candidate loci and studies of telomere measurement methods.</p>

<p>For individuals at increased risk of developing cancer, knowing about the risk can affect decision-making around behavior, couple relationships, family formation, and risk-reduction strategies. DCEG investigators in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=42&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302430" sys_contentid="302430" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1422" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7274924" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302430" rxinlineslot="103">Clinical Genetics Branch</a> are studying the genetic counseling, behavioral and psychosocial implications of being at increased genetic risk of cancer by selectively incorporating such research into both new and ongoing clinical research projects. CGB staff members bring a unique combination of training to these studies, including oncology, cancer genetics, genetic counseling, and marriage/family therapy. Capabilities in these areas are further supplemented by collaborations with senior behavioral research colleagues from other NIH divisions and postdoctoral fellows (including NCI Cancer Prevention Fellows), from the Division of Cancer Control and Population Studies (DCCPS) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI). To date, nearly 50 publications have resulted from this research.</p>
<p>Projects that currently fall within this domain include (1) the ongoing development of the CEGRM (Colored Ecogenetics Relationship Map), a novel counseling tool aimed at identifying sources of social support; (2) a series of analyses focused on the lives of young <i>BRCA1/2</i> mutation carriers; (3) analyses of surgical decision-making and the influence of test ambiguity on screening behavior among <i>BRCA</i> mutation carriers; (4) a comprehensive set of psychosocial/behavioral analyses, both cross-sectional and longitudinal, among GOG-0199 study participants; and (5) initiation of data collection in our newest clinical research protocol, which targets the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.</p>

<p>Myotonic Dystrophy (dystrophia myotonica - DM) is a slowly progressive multi-system genetic disorder that primarily affects skeletal muscles. It is the most common form of adult muscle dystrophy, but the disease can present at any age and as early as birth. Two types of the disease have been described (type 1 and 2); they are clinically similar, with few exceptions, but genetically distinct. Prior to DCEG&rsquo;s research in this area, cancer was not typically thought of as part of the disease phenotype.</p>
<p>When neurologists at the University of Rochester responsible for the management of DM reported the clinical impression that their patients were developing more cancer than expected, DCEG investigators in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=42&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302430" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302430" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7276443" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="302430">Clinical Genetics Branch (CGB)</a> became involved in trying to answer the question &ldquo;Is myotonic dystrophy a cancer susceptibility disorder?&rdquo; The investigators, first in collaboration with investigators at the Karolinska Institutet, Sweden and the University of Rochester, and later with investigators from the Statens Serum Institut, Denmark, performed quantitative analysis using data obtained from population-based diagnosis and cancer registries. They identified a highly significant, two-fold increase in the risk of all cancers combined&mdash;an excess accounted for by cancers of the colon, endometrium, ovary and brain&mdash;among DM patients.</p>
<p>Subsequent reports have suggested that persons with Type 1 DM are twice as likely as those with Type 2 to report a personal history of cancer, but that there is no clear correlation between nucleotide repeat length (the basic molecular abnormality in DM) and cancer risk. Ongoing investigations aim to 1) determine the genetic, clinical, and environmental predictors that may alter cancer risk for myotonic dystrophy patients; and 2) understand the biological mechanisms by which DM increases cancer risk.</p>

<p>Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) is a common genetic disorder of deregulated cell growth, affecting approximately 100,000 Americans. People with NF1 are at an increased risk of developing a variety of benign and malignant tumors. There are limited therapies and no cures for NF1. At this time, it is essentially impossible to predict how severe the disorder will be in a given individual over time. DCEG investigators in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=42&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302430" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276471" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302430" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="302430">Clinical Genetics Branch</a> seek to identify the additional genes (called &ldquo;genetic modifiers&rdquo;) that influence the wide variations in severity seen in individuals with NF1 by applying the principles of translational medicine. Investigators have quantitatively phenotyped a cohort of 135 NF1 individuals from 93 families, and collected multiple research biospecimens.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Analyses of this cohort have yielded multiple novel insights including: 1) recognition of previously-unrecognized tumor associations in NF1, by identifying biallelic NF1 inactivation in glomus tumors, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), and giant cell lesions of the jaw; 2) identification of candidate modifier genes influencing caf&eacute;-au-lait macule number; 3) the first genome-wide association study (GWAS) in NF1; and 4) characterization of novel clinical features (phenotypes) in NF1, including its association with pulmonary hypertension. We have also characterized several other phenotypes with features that significantly overlap those of NF1, including the Jaffe-Campanacci syndrome and Legius syndrome. Investigators are currently collaborating with two multi-institutional groups seeking to identify genetic modifiers of tumor-related phenotypes in NF1.</p>
<p>Investigators are also using next-generation sequencing (NGS) to sequence NF1-associated plexiform neurofibromas. Plexiform neurofibromas are congenital neurofibromas (present at birth) affecting up to 50% of people with NF1, which grow unpredictably and can be locally destructive. They are regarded as pre-cancerous lesions from which malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNSTs) arise. Investigators are using NGS of tumor/normal-tissue pairs to identify the somatic variation that influences risk of tumorigenesis in NF1, an effort modeled upon the NCI Cancer Genome Atlas. They have &nbsp;developed a statistically rigorous two-stage design to identify driver mutations in plexiform neurofibromas, using DNA from tumor/normal-tissue pairs. They are also collaborating with Drs. Brigitte Widemann and Javed Khan of the NCI Pediatric Oncology Branch in a new effort to sequence germline, plexiform neurofibroma and MPNST samples collected from the same individual with NF1, testing the hypothesis that sequencing of such &ldquo;trios&rdquo; will identify driver genes that promote plexiform and MPNST development.</p>
<p>CGB investigators have also undertaken a systematic literature review of all the NF1-associated case reports and cases series published in the last 50 years, focusing on the types and numbers of cancers which have been described. The goal of this effort is to identify for further clinical and molecular characterization under-recognized rare cancers putatively associated with NF1.</p>

<p>The Breast, Endometrial, and Ovarian Risk Assessment Macros (in SAS software) project absolute risk for breast cancer, endometrial cancer and ovarian cancer, respectively, in the batch mode.</p>
<p>Users can enter data on risk factors and projection interval ages for a group of women, and the macros will return the corresponding absolute risk projections. These programs may be useful for researchers who need risk projections for an entire study population.</p>
<p>The breast macro is appropriate for all races and ethnicities in the United States. The macros for endometrial and ovarian cancer risk are currently available for Caucasian and African American women. These models use information about a woman&rsquo;s history of hysterectomy and/or oophorectomy. Adequate data on these factors was only available for these two groups of women.</p>

<p>Roughly one quarter of DCEG&rsquo;s scientific staff are &ldquo;tenure-track&rdquo;.</p>
<p>These early-to-mid-career scientists design and execute in-depth research into the environmental and genetic causes of cancer, and use and develop new methods for data analysis. Similar to academia, DCEG&rsquo;s tenure-track provides a path to scientific tenure at NIH. Each investigator has one or more mentors and a tenure committee to support his or her research program and preparations for NIH tenure evaluation. Learn more about the <a href="https://oir.nih.gov/sourcebook/tenure-nih-intramural-research-program">tenure-track and criteria for tenure at NIH</a>.</p>
<h3>Life as a Tenure-Track Investigator</h3>
<p>Each investigator is expected to manage an independent research portfolio, demonstrating innovation, creativity, and the ability to work collaboratively in teams. They are also expected to successfully train pre- and postdoctoral fellows.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tenure-track investigators receive professional development and career training, both within the Division and from NIH in the form of courses and lectures. Choose from a list of <a href="http://dceg2.cancer.gov/cgi-bin/Personnel.pl?by=tti">tenure-track investigators in DCEG</a> and learn about what they do.</p>

<p>Alaina Shreves, B.S., joined DCEG in June of 2018 after receiving her degree in neuroscience and public health from the College of William and Mary, Williamsburg, Virginia. She has completed research fellowships at West Virginia University&rsquo;s National Center of Excellence in Women's Health and West Virginia University&rsquo;s School of Medicine, where she assisted researchers studying rural health disparities. As an Amgen Scholar at the National Human Genome Research Institute, Ms. Shreves spent the summer of 2017 working in Dr. Laura Koeley&rsquo;s lab studying healthcare trajectories of patients with rare genetic conditions. Her undergraduate research culminated with an honors thesis that utilized electronic health records to analyze clinical trajectories of patients with sickle cell disease. As a DCEG postbaccalaureate fellow, Ms. Shreves works with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349664" sys_contentid="349664" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349664" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7257510" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1965">Robert Hoover, M.D., Sc.D.</a>, Director, Epidemiology and Biostatistics Program, to study the effects of diethylstilbestrol (DES) on unexposed daughters of exposed women.

The test was code-named Trinity. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is carrying out a study to quantitatively estimate the range of possible radiation-related cancer cases in New Mexico that may be related to the nuclear test. To accomplish this task, the research team will use published data on radioactive fallout from the test and descriptions of the typical diet and lifestyle of people living in New Mexico in 1945, which will be drawn from the published literature and collected through targeted interviews to be carried out in New Mexico.</p>

<p>The NCI plans to carry out in-depth interviews to ascertain the typical diet of Native American, Hispanic/Latino, Chicano, and white populations living in New Mexico in the mid-1940s. These interviews are an important step in developing estimates of low, intermediate, radiation doses resulting from Trinity.</p>
<p>To determine how best to collect these data, NCI investigators have engaged in discussions with academics with expertise in Native American and Hispanic lifestyles in the 1940s, as well as advocates and local community leaders. NCI has entered into partnership with a key community group to facilitate the identification of elders who can be interviewed about their historical knowledge regarding lifestyle and diet at the time of the Trinity test.</p>
<p>The investigators plan to publish their work&mdash;the dose reconstruction methods and findings, and cancer risk estimates, as well as the dietary and lifestyle findings resulting from this formative research&mdash;in the peer-reviewed scientific literature and in community newsletters in English and Spanish so it is available to other researchers and the broader community.</p>

<p>El NCI tiene planeado realizar grupos de enfoque y entrevistas para determinar la alimentaci&oacute;n caracter&iacute;stica de las poblaciones ind&iacute;genas americanas, hispanas (latinas), chicanas y blancas que viv&iacute;an en Nuevo M&eacute;xico a mediados de 1940.&nbsp; Estos programas para reunir informaci&oacute;n son un paso importante para hacer estimaciones de las dosis bajas, intermedias y altas de radiaci&oacute;n generadas por la prueba Trinity.</p>
<p>Para determinar la mejor forma de recoger estos datos, los investigadores del NCI han entablado conversaciones con acad&eacute;micos expertos en los estilos de vida de los ind&iacute;genas americanos y de los hispanos en los a&ntilde;os cuarenta, as&iacute; como con promotores y l&iacute;deres locales comunitarios.</p>

<p>As the population of cancer survivors continues to grow (over 13 million in 2012), there is a great need to understand the long-term health of this population. Nearly one in five cancers diagnosed today occurs in an individual with a previous diagnosis of cancer, and these &ldquo;second cancers&rdquo; are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality among cancer survivors. Research into the etiology, prevention, and treatment of second cancers has the potential to improve public health, guide clinical management of survivors, and provide further insight into the mechanisms of carcinogenesis. DCEG investigators are actively engaged in research to address risks associated with:&nbsp;</p>

<h3 id="Treatment">Treatment-Related Second Cancers</h3>
<p>For decades, clinicians and epidemiologists have recognized that radiotherapy and certain chemotherapies may increase risk for developing a second cancer. DCEG investigators study groups of patients with a range of malignancies and varying treatment modalities. This helps to identify risks so that oncologists can refine treatment plans to deliver the most effective treatment dose with the least risk for future cancers. These studies include:</p>

<p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3 id="Lifestyle">Lifestyle, Environmental, and Medical History Factors and Second Cancer Risks</h3>
<p>Investigators are exploring whether the risk of developing second cancers is affected by lifestyle or environmental factors. However, most previous second cancers studies have been based on data from cancer registries or medical records, which generally don&rsquo;t have data on these potential risk factors. By pooling data from large epidemiologic cohort studies, investigators are able to identify whether lifestyle and environmental factors are associated with second cancer risk.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first pooled analyses from the Cohort Consortium, DCEG investigators and colleagues have pooled data from five cohorts (the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, the Agricultural Health Study, the Iowa Women&rsquo;s Study, and the Alpha-Tocopherol, Beta-Carotene Cancer Prevention Study) and are investigating second cancer risks in relation to obesity and tobacco. DCEG investigators and colleagues are also utilizing the SEER-Medicare linked dataset to investigate medical history risk factors for second cancers in a cohort of over 44,000 survivors of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

<h3 id="Genetic">Genetic Susceptibility to Second Cancers</h3>
<p>It is well established that individuals with certain hereditary disorders such as ataxia telangiectasia have increased sensitivity to the carcinogenic effects of radiation, but less is known about how common genetic variation in the general population may relate to risk for second cancers following radiotherapy. Multiple, complex genetic pathways such as DNA damage repair, oxidative stress, and cell cycle control likely contribute to the development of radiation- and chemotherapy-related neoplasms, supporting a polygenic model for sensitivity to treatment-related neoplasms.</p>
<p>Scientists&nbsp;in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch are partnering with investigators from the Childhood Cancer Survivor Study to conduct a genome-wide association study of subsequent neoplasms in childhood cancer survivors. They are also conducting studies of specific <i>RB1</i> mutations and subsequent neoplasm risk in retinoblastoma survivors, with exome sequencing for patients with selected types of subsequent neoplasms. Opportunities exist for postdoctoral fellows to participate in current and future research on genetic susceptibility to multiple primary cancers. Results from this work may help inform clinical decision-making for cancer patients to minimize future cancer risk.

<p>Breast cancer survivors constitute about 25% of the growing population of cancer survivors in the US. Contralateral breast cancer is the most common second cancer in women with primary breast cancer. With increasing cure rates comes increasing concern about their long-term health. Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) investigators and collaborators from the Kaiser health maintenance organization have developed a retrospective cohort of about 7,000 breast cancer patients diagnosed since 1991. By linking electronic treatment files and the Kaiser cancer registries for information on subsequent cancers, researchers have developed a rich resource for studying the late effects of breast cancer treatments. Tumor tissue samples from both the first and second breast cancers and mammography films have also been collected. Analyses are underway to evaluate the relationship among radiotherapy, newer hormonal therapies, chemotherapy agents, and obesity in survivors.</p>

<p>DCEG is exploring the relationship between host immune function and risk for glioma; one of the deadliest forms of brain cancer yet a malignancy for which few definitive risk factors have been identified. While previous reports on allergy/atopy and risk of glioma showed an inverse association, these data were mainly from case-control studies and potentially prone to survival and recall bias.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To minimize the bias from earlier studies, DCEG investigators examined medical records for a cohort of black and white male US veterans with relatively homogenous socioeconomic background.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The investigators considered a collection of immune-related conditions and observed that history of allergy/atopy and diabetes of long latency to be associated with reduced risk of subsequent brain cancer. To advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying these associations, future studies with prospectively ascertained and validated medical diagnoses, treatment information, and biological samples to measure immune function markers are needed.</p>

<p>This study is designed to improve our understanding of radiation-related risk for intracranial tumors of the brain and nervous system through a pooled analysis of 16 epidemiological studies that have a reasonable number of exposed study subjects, individual estimates of radiation dose to the brain and different reasons for radiation exposure. By including a large number of individuals exposed over a wide range of doses, at different dose rates and ages, we hope to increase precision to quantify the overall dose-response relationship for specific histological types of tumors (glioma, meningioma and acoustic neuroma) and to address effects of possible modifying factors.&nbsp;In particular, results would aid in the assessment of risks related to CT scans, a question of considerable public health importance in light of their growing use.</p>

<p>Taller height and greater body mass index have been consistently associated with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, but few studies have investigated the role of childhood body size. We prospectively examined associations between annual measurements of childhood height and body mass index (at ages 7-13 years) with risk of thyroid cancer in adulthood by linking measurement data from over 320,000 schoolchildren in Copenhagen, with cancer incidence data from the Danish Cancer Registry. Both height and body mass index in childhood were positively associated with thyroid cancer risk, suggesting a potential role for early-life factors related to growth and body weight in thyroid carcinogenesis.</p>

<p>For reasons that are not currently well understood, the incidence of thyroid cancer has rapidly increased in several countries over the past three decades. Individual case-control and cohort studies have suggested links between taller height and greater body mass index with an increased risk of thyroid cancer, particularly for papillary carcinoma, the most common and least aggressive subtype. However, these studies have been underpowered to examine associations for other anthropometric measurements, including waist circumference and weight change, and to evaluate differences by histological subtype.&nbsp;We combined data from 22 prospective studies in North America, Europe, Australia, and Asia to evaluate these questions in one of the largest and most comprehensive studies on this topic to date.</p>

<p>Childhood leukemia is among the most radiosensitive cancers. DCEG investigators have contributed to the study of this cancer by verifying that only with adequate statistical power provided by tens of thousands of cases can assessments of risk be determined. In a record linkage study, DCEG investigators and collaborators linked over 60,000 cases from a large UK database and found a significant association of leukemia with natural background radiation exposure. These findings were consistent with the linear low dose risks observed in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors.</p>

<p>The number of CT scans performed in the United States has increased to more than 70 million per year.&nbsp;CT scans of young patients are of particular concern because, in comparison with adults, children are exposed to higher doses, are generally more sensitive to the carcinogenic effects of radiation, and have a longer life-span to express radiation-related cancers. In a study of 180,000 children, DCEG investigators found increased risks of leukemia and brain tumors after childhood CT scans following linear dose-response relationships for leukemia and brain tumors that were broadly consistent with the risks observed in the Japanese atomic bomb survivors. The absolute risk estimates were small. Work is continuing in the United Kingdom and other cohorts to address further questions about the relationship between pediatric CT scans and subsequent cancer risk.</p>

<p>Cancers of the skin (e.g. melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma) are the most common cancers in the United States, constituting over one million diagnosed cases every year, and the primary risk factor is exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) investigators are using the U.S. Radiologic Technologists Cohort, the only nationwide U.S. cohort with lifetime residential history and questionnaire-derived estimates of time spent outdoors, to further understand the risk of UVR exposure. By linking historical NASA satellite estimates of ambient UVR to geocoded locations of residence throughout the lifetime, investigators have developed a rich resource for studying the effects of UVR on skin cancers and the potentially protective effects of UVR on other cancer sites. Previous research has included the assessment of photosensitizing drugs, ambient temperature, and methodological studies of personal UVR and vitamin D exposure assessment. REB investigators have also examined the association of UVR with cancer incidence and mortality in the NIH-AARP study, as well as UVR and non-Hodgkin lymphoma subtypes across race/ethnicities in SEER.</p>

<p>The Epstein&ndash;Barr virus (EBV), also known as human herpesvirus 4, is a virus of the <i>Herpesveridae</i> family, and is one of the most common DNA viruses in humans. EBV infection is associated with several benign and malignant diseases, including Burkitt and some other types of lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and gastric cancer. Monoclonal EBV DNA is found in the tumor cells of about 9% of gastric adenocarcinomas, which have particular molecular characteristics (see References). The etiological significance of the viral infection is uncertain.</p>
<p>The NCI International EBV-Gastric Cancer Consortium is a collaboration among NCI and extramural investigators, established by DCEG in 2006. This Consortium utilizes data and biospecimens from completed and ongoing case series and observational studies of gastric cancer conducted in low- and high-risk populations. The presence of EBV in cancer cells is assessed by <i>in situ</i> hybridization for EBV-encoded RNA (EBER), the gold standard assay for detecting latent infection. This research effort was designed&nbsp;to replicate and extend findings from previous studies hindered by small numbers of EBV-positive cases, and to stimulate multidisciplinary research in this area. Analyses from this research group to date have focused on epidemiological and clinicopathological characterization of EBV-positive gastric cancer (see References). Laboratory studies comparing EBV-positive and -negative cases are currently underway addressing:</p>

<p>Breast cancer is known to vary significantly by race/ethnicity. While ER+ breast cancer is a signature disease in Western populations, breast cancer among Asians has been associated with an early age-onset, a higher proportion of ER&ndash; tumors, and a distinct shape of age-specific incidence rate patterns. In addition, Asian women also have a higher proportion of dense breast tissue.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DCEG investigators are conducting studies in several Asian populations, including mainland China, Hong Kong, and Malaysia. In these studies, breast tissues (frozen and/or formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues) as well as information on risk factors, clinical data, breast density, blood or saliva for germline DNA, are being collected. The main goals of these studies are to identify distinct molecular alterations in tumors and adjacent normal tissues among Asian women and to examine the associations of these molecular changes with risk factors (genetic and environmental), breast tissue composition and density, and breast cancer subtypes.</p>

<p>The Ghana Breast Health Study, a multidisciplinary case-control study of breast cancer, was launched in Ghana, West Africa, in 2013. The main aims of the study are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify factors that predispose to the development of breast cancer among Ghanaian women;</li>
<li>Identify genetic and other biologic factors predictive of risk;</li>
<li>Assess how these risk factors vary by clinical and molecular characteristics of the tumors</li>
</ul>
<p>The study, which aims ultimately to recruit approximately 2,000 cases and 2,000 population controls, is being conducted in three hospitals in Ghana&mdash; Korle Bu Teaching Hospital in Accra; Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital, and Peace and Love Hospital in Kumasi. Population controls are randomly selected from the same residential areas as cases are expected to derive. Exposure information is being obtained through detailed personal interviews and anthropometric measurements. Breast tissue samples are being collected prior to treatment and preserved to enable accurate immunohistochemical characterization of tumor subtypes. Blood, saliva and fecal samples are also being collected to enable assessment of genetic risk markers, microbiome characteristics, and other possible biomarkers.</p>
<p>The study began with a one-year pilot, following standardized training of study staff in January 2013. During this time, we achieved questionnaire response rates of 99% in cases and 80% in controls, along with collection of biologic samples from most of the women interviewed. This success supported extension of the study for an additional two years. Preliminary data show a relatively high prevalence of exposure to some novel risk factors (e.g., 25% of women report use of skin lighteners, some of which contain hormonal constituents). The study should provide a wealth of data to inform our knowledge of the epidemiology of breast cancer in African women.</p>

<p>Linkage studies and candidate locus studies have had limited success in identifying genetic susceptibility genes for testicular germ cell tumors (TGCT).&nbsp;Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), however, have identified a number of important loci, the one with the highest hazard ratio being <i>KITLG</i>, which confers a risk &nbsp;greater than three-fold over background.&nbsp;GWAS have now been completed in a number of populations and investigators have come together to pool their data to study TGCT as a consortium. Study results are being combined to develop better estimates of risk for each genetic variant. In addition, stratified analyses are examining whether risk of each variant varies by other factors such as histology of the TGCT, history of cryptorchidism, and family history of TGCT.</p>

<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Age&ndash;period&ndash;cohort (APC) analysis can inform registry-based studies of cancer incidence and mortality, but concerns about statistical identifiability and interpretability, as well as the learning curves of statistical software packages, have limited its uptake. This tool contains a panel of easy-to-interpret estimable APC functions and corresponding Wald tests in R code that can be accessed through a user-friendly Web tool.</p>

<h2>Details</h2>
<p>Input data for the Web tool consist of age-specific numbers of events and person-years over time, in the form of a rate matrix of paired columns. Output functions include model-based estimators of cross-sectional and longitudinal age-specific rates, period and cohort rate ratios that incorporate the overall annual percentage change (net drift), and estimators of the age-specific annual percentage change (local drifts). The Web tool includes built-in examples for teaching and demonstration. User data can be input from a Microsoft Excel worksheet or by uploading a comma-separated&ndash;value file. Model outputs can be saved in a variety of formats, including R and Excel.</p>

<h3><a id="Machiela"></a>Genetic Epidemiology of Cancer - Postdoctoral Fellowship</h3>
<p>Dr. Mitchell Machiela, an investigator in the DCEG <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=37&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302506" sys_contentid="302506" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7299185" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302506" sys_dependentvariantid="1422">Integrative Tumor Epidemiology Branch</a>, is seeking a postdoctoral fellow with interest in conducting integrative analyses on the genetic etiology of cancer. Genetic epidemiology has remarkable potential to improve understanding of cancer etiology by identifying germline genetic variation and acquired somatic mutations associated with cancer risk. Specific areas of Dr. Machiela's research include:</p>
<ol>
<li>Next-generation sequencing studies to identify acquired mutations that could impact cancer risk in special exposure populations (e.g., drug and radiation exposure);</li>
<li>Studies characterizing the distribution and determinants of structural mosaic copy number changes in large cancer case/control and cohort studies (~200,000 participants) with existing array genotyping data; and</li>
<li>Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in pediatric cancers to identify and functionally map germline variants associated with increased risk (e.g., Ewing sarcoma).</li>
</ol>
<p>All studies of the genetic etiology of cancer are population-based with extensive data on exposures, genetic variation and phenotypic characterization. The potential candidate will be part of an interdisciplinary team of genetic, bioinformatic and laboratory investigators.

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Exploring linkage disequilibrium (LD) across ancestral populations is a powerful approach for investigating population-specific genetic structure as well as functionally mapping regions of disease susceptibility. LDlink is a suite of web-based applications designed to easily and efficiently interrogate linkage disequilibrium in population groups. LDlink consists of four modules for interactively exploring linkage disequilibrium: LDhap, LDmatrix, LDpair, and LDproxy. Modules are designed with an emphasis on ease of use, query flexibility, and interactive visualization of results. Haplotype tables and interactive plots generated by LDlink are tailored for investigators interested in mapping common and uncommon disease susceptibility loci with a focus on linking correlated alleles and highlighting potentially functional variants.</p>

</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>All population genotype data for LDlink and its modules originates from Phase 3 of the 1000 Genomes Project. The genotyped set is complete with all individuals having called genotypes at every included locus. Ancestral super-populations include African, Ad-mixed American, East Asian, European, and South Asian. LDlink is flexible to allow for any combination of 1000 Genomes Project super or sub-populations as input. For query input, LDlink uses dbSNP build 142 to reference SNP (RS) numbers and extract genomic coordinates. The current implementation of LDlink only accepts bi-allelic SNPs as input.</p>

<h3>Radiation Epidemiology Course Registration</h3>
<p><a id="top"></a>The next <strong>Radiation Epidemiology &amp; Dosimetry Course</strong> will be held September 9-12, 2019, at NCI Shady Grove, Rockville, Maryland.&nbsp;<a href="https://events.cancer.gov/2019RADEPI">Register for the Radiation Epidemiology &amp; Dosimetry Course</a>.</p>
</div>
<p>The Radiation Epidemiology and Dosimetry Course is conducted periodically by the Radiation Epidemiology Branch of the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). The course is intended for people who are interested in learning about the health effects of radiation exposure. The course begins with the fundamentals and progresses to topical sessions which provide an overview of the methods and key findings from studies of medical, occupational, and environmental radiation exposures.</p>
<p>The course was designed assuming participants will have some familiarity with basic epidemiologic concepts, terminology and methods of data analysis; however, most of the material will be understandable for people with college-level training in basic biology, chemistry and physics.</p>
<h2>Course Format</h2>
<ul>
<li>Large-group (~200 people) lectures</li>
<li>Informal lunchtime and evening gatherings support discussion and networking</li>
<li>Registration is free but required due to space limitations</li>

<p>BCRA is an R package that projects absolute risk of invasive breast cancer according to <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/bcrisktool/">NCI&rsquo;s Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool</a> (BCRAT) algorithm for specified race/ethnic groups and age intervals.</p>
<p>This package is to project absolute risk of invasive breast cancer according to NCI&rsquo;s Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool (BCRAT) algorithm for specified race/ethnic groups and age intervals. The updated version 2.0 includes the new Hispanic model.</p>
<p>This package can be used to estimate the risk of developing breast cancer over a predetermined time interval with risk factors. As the same as Breast Cancer Risk Assessment SAS Macro, the users can specify the time interval as appropriate, not only limited to the 5 years risk prediction available with BCRAT.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The main function in this package is <math>absolute.risk</math>, which is defined based on a statistical model known as the "Gail model". Parameters and constants needed in this function include initial and projection age, recoded covariates using function <math> recode.check</math>, relative risks of BrCa at age "&lt;50" and "&gt;=50" obtained from function <math>relative.risk</math> as well as other known constants listed from function <math>list.constants</math> like BrCa composite incidences, competing hazards, 1-attributable risk using in NCI BrCa Risk Assessment Tool (NCI BCRAT). With risk factors and projection interval ages for a group of women, the function <math>absolute.risk</math> will return the corresponding absolute risk projections. If the function returns any missing values, the function <math>error.table</math> or <math>error.table.all</math> is used to find where the errors occured. The function <math>check.summary</math> can give a quick check for errors of input file and missing values of risks.&nbsp; For further analysis, a data frame is created from the function <math>risk.summary</math>, which includes age, duration of the projection time interval, covariates and the projected risk.</p>
<p>The version 2.0 includes absolute risk projections for Hispanic women (US born and Foreign born) based on race specific RR risk models developed on the San Francisco Bay Area Breast Cancer Study (SFBCS). Race specific attributable risks, breast cancer composite incidences and competing hazards are added to the updated package.</p>
<p>Any changes/modifications to the package would be at the user&rsquo;s own discretion and risk.</p>

<p>The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has classified ambient outdoor particulate matter (PM) as a Group 1 human carcinogen. It is unclear, however, if the lung cancer risks primarily linked to long-term exposure to fine PM (PM<sub>2.5</sub>, aerodynamic diameter &lt;2.5&micro;m) are driven by its constituent ultrafine particles (UFP, &lt;100nm), which may be more toxic due to their unique physiochemical properties. This prospective cohort study among the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study participants in the Los Angeles Basin is being conducted in collaboration with the University of Southern California and Utrecht University.&nbsp;The&nbsp;primary aim of the Los Angeles Ultrafines Study is to evaluate the&nbsp;association between long-term exposure to ambient outdoor UFP and lung cancer risk.</p>
<p>The Los Angeles Ultrafines Study population has several important features needed to assess this etiologic relationship, including substantial regional variation in PM concentrations, large numbers of lung cancer cases, and data on smoking and residential histories. A comprehensive retrospective exposure assessment draws upon one of the most complete repositories of historical UFP data available, supplemented by a mobile ambient monitoring campaign in Los Angeles and surrounding counties.</p>

</div>
<p>The Laboratory of Genomic Susceptibility (LGS) investigates the biological basis for genetic susceptibility to cancer, including identification and characterization of cancer susceptibility alleles, characterization of the scope of genetic mosaicism and its contribution to cancer risk, investigation of the genetic architecture of cancer susceptibility, and determination of how germline variation informs our understanding of somatic alterations in cancer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>LGS scientists participate in genetic, epidemiologic, clinical and methodological studies of populations, families, and persons at risk for cancer. In addition, they collaborate and consult with experts in statistical genetics, bioinformatics, genetic epidemiology, and molecular epidemiology in interdisciplinary studies. Using large-scale genome-wide association studies, familial linkage studies in high-risk families, and publically available databases, such as TCGA (<a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas</a>), TARGET (<a href="https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target">Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments</a>), ENCODE (<a href="https://www.encodeproject.org/">Encyclopedia of DNA Elements</a>), and GTEx (<a href="http://www.genome.gov/GTEx/">The Genotype-Tissue Expression Project</a>), investigators continue to identify loci within the human genome that are associated with cancer risk.</p>
<h3>Genome-Wide Association Studies</h3>
<p>The laboratory is at the forefront of applications in bioinformatics and advanced genetic analyses with new platforms designed to evaluate the biological effects of dense sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are the most common genetic variants in the human genome. Specifically, the laboratory has integrated approaches to identify and validate common SNPs and ancestral haplotypes, which could be used to dissect the genetic basis of disease susceptibility. Together with NCI&rsquo;s <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=460151" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="460151" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7242509" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="460151">Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory</a>, LGS carries out genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Using data from large-scale GWAS that evaluate millions of SNPs, investigators at the LGS are able to identify in great detail new regions in the human genome that are associated with cancer risk and to estimate the magnitude of effect of these risks. GWAS have been instrumental in the discovery of new regions of the genome, which influence the basic etiological risk factors. In addition, these novel findings may, at a later time, also bear important predictive value for disease, particularly in developing a polygenic model as well as highlight potential molecular pathways related to both disease etiology and perhaps therapeutic intervention.</p>
<h3>Investigation of GWAS Signals</h3>
<p>To understand the biology underlying these associations, investigators are following up with focused validation studies, deep-sequencing, and functional analyses, such as analyses of expression levels and methylation patterns. This research relies on multidisciplinary approaches from population genetics, epidemiology and molecular evolution. Investigation of GWAS signals requires extensive bioinformatic follow-up to examine unannotated transcripts, regulatory elements, as well as functional elements for novel transcripts. Regulatory effects are queried with respect to the alteration of gene levels, epigenetics, and long-ranging effects on other genes at a distance using cell lines, normal tissue and tumor tissue, as well as resources from the TCGA and the ICGC (the<a href="https://icgc.org/"> International Cancer Genome Consortium</a>). The LGS is also investigating several possible biologic mechanisms including whether variations in these identified regions may affect regulatory elements of neighboring genes, the impact of miRNA polymorphisms acting upon fragile chromosomal sites, and epigenetic effects across multi-susceptibility regions.</p>
<p>We have developed a series of collaborations with leading epidemiologists and biostatisticians in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), the NCI Cohort Consortium, and multiple other international molecular epidemiologic consortia. Data pooling is being used to achieve the statistical power necessary to detect associations between genomic variants and a variety of health outcomes, as well as gene-environment interactions. &nbsp;</p>
<h3>Mosaicism</h3>
<p>An interesting outcome from GWAS studies at LGS has been the identification of a sizeable fraction of apparently healthy individuals that harbor large scale (&gt;2MB) mosaic events detected as copy number changes or copy-neutral uniparental disomies. Investigating human clonal mosaicism has the potential to offer new insights into genomic maintenance as individuals age, as well as explain a portion of the phenotypic heterogeneity of cancer subtypes. With the accumulation of cancer susceptibility regions from GWAS and large new datasets of tumor sequencing data, it is now possible to investigate the interplay between inherited germline genetics and acquired somatic mutations. The expertise of LGS staff and their collaborations with other DCEG experts enable novel investigation into how germline genetics combined with somatically acquired mutations may affect susceptibility to cancer.</p>

<p>An R package to compute Individualized Coherent Absolute Risk Estimators (iCARE)</p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>iCARE allows researchers to quickly build models for absolute risk, and apply them to estimate an individual's risk of developing disease during a specifed time interval, based on a set of user defined input parameters. An attractive feature of the software is that it gives users fexibility to update models rapidly based on new knowledge of risk factors and tailor models to different populations. The tool requires three input arguments be specifed: (1) a model for relative risk (2) an age-specifc disease incidence rate and (3) the distribution of risk factors for the population of interest. The tool handles missing risk factor information for individuals for whom risks are to be predicted using a coherent approach where all estimates are derived from a single model after appropriate model averaging. The software allows single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to be incorporated into the model using published odds ratios and allele frequencies.</p>

</div>
<p>On April 26, 1986, an accident occurred at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in northern Ukraine. In addition to 28 near-term deaths due to radiation, the accident resulted in the exposure of 5 million people in Belarus, Russia and Ukraine to fallout from the accident, principally radioiodines.</p>
<h2>DCEG Studies of Radiation and Health Effects</h2>
<p>This exposure has led to substantial epidemiological research, especially among clean-up workers and children. The governments of Ukraine, Belarus and the United States (namely the Radiation Epidemiology Branch at NCI), and other research partners, have been conducting these studies.</p>

<p>Research conducted by DCEG investigators falls into three main categories: <a href="#Epidemiological">Epidemiological</a>, <a href="#Molecular">Molecular Genomic</a>, and <a href="#Dosimetric">Dosimetric</a>.</p>
<h3><a id="Epidemiological"></a>Epidemiological Studies of Radiation-Related Cancers and Other Diseases</h3>
<p>Scientists in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) have been involved in a multilateral collaboration for several years with researchers and scientists in Belarus, Ukraine, and Russia to conduct epidemiological studies of thyroid diseases and leukemia among the populations affected by the 1986 Chernobyl accident in Ukraine.</p>
<h4><a id="Thyroid-Chernobyl"></a>Thyroid Disease in Young Persons Near Chernobyl</h4>
<p>The accident exposed large numbers of people in Ukraine, Belarus and Russia to radioactive iodines, principally I-131, which concentrates in the thyroid gland (Hatch, et al., 2005; Cardis and Hatch, 2011). From 1998 to 2007/8, biennial thyroid screening examinations were conducted among approximately 25,000 individuals exposed to the accident as children or adolescents in Ukraine and Belarus. The initial report from Ukraine provides convincing evidence in support of earlier reports of a five- or six-fold radiation-related increase in thyroid cancer among those who were young at the time of the accident and includes individual dose estimates on all subjects. The data show a strong, approximately linear dose-response relationship.</p>
<p>Other studies in Ukraine include individuals exposed <em>in utero</em> to radioiodines, who may have a raised risk of thyroid neoplasia. The relationships between radiation and autoimmune thyroiditis, follicular adenoma, hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism have also been assessed. Current efforts utilize national cancer registries for follow-up and various strategies for maintaining contact with these cohorts.</p>

<h4><a id="Leukemia-Chernobyl"></a>Leukemia Risk in Chernobyl Clean-up Workers</h4>
<p>Following the accident, hundreds of thousands of clean-up workers (also called liquidators) from Ukraine were exposed primarily to external radiation with those sent earliest receiving the highest doses (185 mGy in 1986, 112 mGy in 1987 and 47 mGy in 1988-89). To date, studies of cancer among clean-up workers have focused on leukemia. The Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) in collaboration with the Research Center for Radiation Medicine in Ukraine has conducted a case-control study of leukemia and other hematological diseases based on a large cohort of male clean-up workers (~110,000), with individual doses to the bone marrow estimated using a new method developed for this study. Findings from the first phase of the study based on cases diagnosed between 1987-2000 have been summarized in three companion papers (Methods, Dosimetry, Risk analysis) published in Radiation Research (vol. 170, 2008). The study was extended to accrue cases for an additional six years.</p>

<h3><a id="Molecular"></a>Advanced Molecular Genomic Research Studies</h3>
<p>DCEG investigators are applying the full capabilities of cutting edge molecular and genetic epidemiological methods to expand our knowledge on the relationship between ionizing radiation and cancer. To understand how exposure to parents may affect future offspring, experts have launched a study of parent-child trios in which at least one parent was exposed to Chernobyl radiation as a clean-up worker and/or evacuee from a contaminated area. REB researchers are applying whole genome sequencing techniques to thyroid tumor, adjacent normal, and blood samples obtained through the Chernobyl Tissue Bank to better understand the genetic makeup of this malignancy.</p>

<p>Several years after an initial agreement was reached between the United States and the USSR in 1988, to cooperate in the area of nuclear reactor safety, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) undertook to develop long-term studies of thyroid cancer among exposed children in Ukraine and Belarus. The incidence of thyroid cancer in children, ordinarily very rare, had begun to increase markedly following the accident, and a rigorous investigation was needed to assess the relationship between exposure to I-131 from Chernobyl and the occurrence of thyroid cancer and other thyroid disorders. Responsibility for the study resides in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch of NCI.</p>
<p>The first contacts between the U.S. and Ukrainian governments concerning this project were made in the early 1990s. In the next few years, a study protocol was developed and approved, and in 1995 an agreement for funding was signed in Kiev. Thyroid cancer screening of study participants began in 1998.</p>
<h3><a id="Overview"></a>Program Overview</h3>
<p>The screening program, which was carried out in the heavily contaminated norther regions of Ukraine (Kiev, Chernigov and Zhitomir oblasts as well as Kiev City), consisted of biennial examinations of the thyroid glands of approximately 13,000 individuals who were exposed as children (aged 0-17 years old) and who had thyroid radioactivity measurements made in the weeks following the accident. The screening protocol was designed to determine whether a participant had thyroid cancer or a range of other thyroid diseases, such as benign nodules.</p>
<p>The screening program consisted of the following: a medical history; palpation of the thyroid by an endocrinologist and an ultrasonographer; an ultrasound examination of the thyroid; and collection of a blood sample (for measurement of thyroid hormones and thyroid auto-antibodies) and a spot urine sample (to measure excreted iodine); as well as a detailed interview for estimating cumulative individual radiation dose to the thyroid gland that included a residential history, data on consumption of contaminated foods, and use of iodine prophylaxis. A study of those exposed to the accident while <em>in utero</em> (N=1494) and a comparison cohort of unexposed <em>in utero</em> subjects (N=1088) has been completed (Hatch et al., 2009).</p>
<p>The radioiodine doses estimated for each cohort member are based on the thyroid radioactivity measurements, ecologic data (for example, deposition patterns), and interview data on residential location and consumption of contaminated foods around the time of the accident. Fetal thyroid doses were derived from maternal doses (Likhtarev et al., in press).</p>
<p>The active screening program was completed in 2007/8. Follow-up of the cohort continues via linkage with the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine, (NCRU). The study center is located in Kiev and includes the facilities of the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism, the Scientific Center for Radiation Medicine, Academy of Medical Sciences, the NCRU and the University of Illinois at Chicago, Kiev Data Management Center.</p>
<p><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="Objectives"><a id="Objectives"></a>Objectives</h3>
<p>The primary objective of this collaborative research is to determine the relationship between I-131 exposure from the Chernobyl accident and risk of thyroid cancer. The effect of dose level, age at the time of exposure and gender are of particular interest, with effects of stable iodine also being considered. Associations between I-131 and benign thyroid nodules and other thyroid diseases have also been evaluated. The effects of I-131 in inducing thyroid cancer are being compared with published data on external radiation to assess their relative potency.</p>
<p><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="Progress"><a id="Progress"></a>Progress&nbsp;to Date</h3>
<h4>1st Screening Cycle</h4>
<p>The initial enrollment in the first round of screening was 13,243. To insure a high level of participation, the screening examinations were conducted both at the stationary center in Kiev (28%) and in mobile units (72%) that were sent out to parts of the study area some distance from Kiev. The first cycle was completed in 2001.&nbsp;Forty-five cancers were diagnosed as a result of the first round of screening.</p>
<p>Results of the analysis of radiation dose-response in relation to the prevalent cancers from the first round of screening in Ukraine (excess odds ratio per Gray (EOR/GY) of 5.25; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.7, 27.5) were published in JNCI (2006, vol. 98 (13):897-903).</p>
<h4>2nd - 4th Cycles</h4>
<p>Sixty-five incident cancers were identified in the 2nd-4th cycles. The analysis of the dose-response relationship for incident thyroid cancers yielded an excess relative risk per Gray (ERR/Gy) two decades after exposure of 1.91 (95% CI: 0.43, 6.34 (Brenner et al., 2011).</p>
<p>Current research opportunities include a variety of projects concerning incidence of the many benign thyroid diseases identified in the study cohort, as well as genetic projects (gene expression, analysis of candidate SNPs) utilizing tissue samples archived in the Chernobyl Tissue Bank and blood samples collected from study subjects. Clinical follow-up of subjects with nodules detected during active screening is also underway.</p>
<p><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="Benefits"><a id="Benefits"></a>Benefits&nbsp;to Ukrainians</h3>
<p>One benefit to Ukrainians has been the long-term screening and evaluation of the population at risk that may reduce problems and increase survival by detecting thyroid disease early when treatment is most effective. The project has also assisted local health officials in developing appropriate health-care programs by providing pertinent, valuable data on a range of topics, including iodine nutrition. Technical and scientific training has been provided to collaborators and the general population has been educated on the importance of early detection and regular screening in preventing morbidity and death from thyroid cancer. Our published findings have contributed to the data base that health care providers, health policy and nuclear safety experts will draw upon to formulate future plans for similar exposure situations. In addition, the results are contributing to a basic understanding of the carcinogenic and other adverse health effects of I-131.</p>

<h3 id="Roles"><a id="Roles"></a>Roles&nbsp;of United States&nbsp;Participants</h3>
<ul>
<li>The NCI staff is charged with scientific direction and management of the projects.</li>
<li>The Thyroid Advisory Group, comprised of experts in all relevant areas, provides external oversight. The Group reviews the progress of each arm of the thyroid studies at least once per year.

<h3><a id="Overview"></a>Program Overview</h3>
<p>The screening program carried out in all six oblasts of Belarus comprised three cycles and consisted of serial examinations of the thyroid glands of approximately 12,000 individuals who were exposed as children (0-18 years) and who had thyroid radioactivity measurements made in the weeks following the accident. The screening protocol was designed to determine whether a participant had thyroid cancer or a range of other thyroid diseases, such as benign nodules.</p>
<p>Most members of the cohort reside in Gomel, Minsk and Mogilev Oblasts. The screening program consists of the following: a medical history; palpation of the thyroid by an endocrinologist and an ultrasonographer; an ultrasound examination of the thyroid; and collection of a blood sample (for measurement of thyroid hormones and thyroid auto-antibodies) and a spot urine sample (to measure excreted iodine); a detailed dosimetry interview to obtain a residential history, data on consumption of contaminated foods, and use of iodine prophylaxis is also administered.</p>
<p>The radioiodine doses estimated for each cohort member have been based on the thyroid radioactivity measurements, ecologic data (for example, deposition patterns), and interview data on residential location and consumption of contaminated foods around the time of the accident.</p>
<p>Active screening was completed in 2008. Follow-up of the cohort continues through linkage with the Belarus Cancer Registry. The study center, originally based at the Research Institute of Radiation Medicine and Endocrinology in Minsk, was transferred in 2004 to the new Republican Research Center of Radiation Medicine and Human Ecology in Gomel.</p>
<h3><a id="Objectives"></a>Objectives</h3>
<p>The primary objective of this collaborative research is to determine the relationship between I-131 exposure from the Chernobyl accident and risk of thyroid cancer. The effect of dose level, age at the time of exposure and gender are of particular interest, along with effects of stable iodine status. Associations between I -131 and benign thyroid nodules and other thyroid diseases are also being evaluated. The effect of I-131 in inducing thyroid cancer will be compared with published data on external radiation to assess their relative potency.</p>
<p><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3><a id="Progress"></a>Progress&nbsp;to Date</h3>
<p><strong><em>1st Screening Cycle</em></strong><br /> The initial enrollment in the first round of screening was 11,918. To insure a high level of participation, the screening examinations were conducted both at the stationary center in Minsk (approximately 40%) and in mobile units (approximately 60%) that were sent out to parts of the study area some distance from Minsk. The first cycle was completed in 2001. As a result of the first screening, 85 cases with doses &lt; 5 Gy were identified. The excess odds ratio per Gy for this group was 2.15 (95% CI: 0.81, 5.47) (Zablotska et al., 2011).</p>
<p><strong><em>2nd - 3rd Screening Cycles</em></strong><br /> Seventy-one confirmed thyroid cancers cases were identified in the 2nd and 3rd cycles. Active screening has been terminated but future follow-up of the cancer experience of the cohort continues through linkage with the national Belarus Cancer Registry.</p>

<h3><a id="Benefits"></a>Benefits&nbsp;to Belarusians</h3>
<p>Benefits to Belarusians include the long-term screening and evaluation of the population at risk and continued monitoring through the Belarus Cancer Registry. The project also assists local health officials in developing appropriate health-care programs by providing pertinent, valuable data on a range of topics, including iodine nutrition. Technical and scientific training has been offered to collaborators and the general population has been educated on the importance of early detection and regular screening in preventing morbidity and death from thyroid cancer. Publications describing the findings are beginning to appear. Our research findings contribute to the data base that health care providers, health policy and nuclear safety experts will draw upon to formulate future plans for similar exposure situations. In addition, the results will add to our basic understanding of the carcinogenic and other adverse health effects of I-131.</p>

<p>Several years after a 1988 agreement between the United States and the USSR to cooperate in the area of nuclear reactor safety, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), NIH undertook to develop a study of leukemia risk among Ukrainian men potentially exposed to external radiation during clean-up operations (e.g., liquidators) following the Chernobyl accident. Responsibility for the study resides in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch of NCI.</p>
<p>Leukemia, a malignancy arising from the bone marrow, is strongly associated with radiation exposure because of the sensitivity of the bone marrow to the carcinogenic effects of external radiation. Leukemia is also among the earliest cancer sites to show an increase following radiation exposure, and one of the malignancies most consistently associated with external radiation exposure. Evaluating leukemia risk among the Chernobyl clean-up workers was important both in and of itself and also because of the information it would provide about risks to individuals in similar circumstances involving protracted exposure, such as nuclear workers.</p>
<p>Efforts to develop a research plan for studying leukemia among clean-up workers in Ukraine began as early as 1989-1990. A pilot phase, conducted between 1997-1999 to establish the feasibility of the proposed investigation, showed that a suitable cohort could be assembled and that representative clean-up workers could be located and interviewed regarding their experience during the clean-up operations. Leukemia cases were registered in hematologic facilities in central oblast dispensaries and the medical records were found to be readily available. A sample of 100 cases of leukemia and related disorders was collected and reviewed by an international group of hematologists and pathologists, with a high level of confirmation of the preliminary diagnoses made by local hematologists.</p>
<h3 id="overview"><a id="Overview"></a>Program Overview</h3>
<p>The cohort consists of approximately 110,000 clean-up workers in Ukraine who worked in the 30 km zone around the plant during 1986-1990 and resided in Kiev City or in one of the following oblasts: Cherkassy, Chernigov, Dnepropetrovsk, Kharkov, Kiev. The cohort was identified through the State Chernobyl Registry. In the first phase of the study, cases of leukemia and other hematologic disorders (specifically multiple myleoma and myelodysplasia ) were sought in all relevant health care institutions and assembled into a leukemia registry. Ultimately, record linkage was used to identify cases occurring among members of the cohort between 1987-2000. For each case, five controls were drawn from cohort members who did not develop hematologic disorders, matched to the case on age and area of residence. To gather information for estimating individual dose, detailed interviews are conducted to obtain data related to cumulative estimated dose to bone marrow. Estimated bone marrow doses based on a specially-developed time-and-motion approach have been evaluated in a statistical analysis (Romanenko et al., 2008) to evaluate the dose response relationship with leukemia risk overall, as well as with two separate subgroups: chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL, a hematologic malignancy generally thought not to be related to radiation exposure) and non-CLL cases.</p>
<p><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="objectives"><a id="Objectives"></a>Objectives</h3>
<p>The principal objective of the study is to evaluate whether there is a dose-related increase in risk of leukemia among the clean-up workers. Possible modifiers of risk such as age at exposure or time since exposure are of particular interest. Also of interest will be to compare the magnitude of the observed risk per unit dose from a protracted exposure with that seen in the atomic bomb survivors, who received an acute exposure.</p>
<p><a href="#Top">Back to top</a></p>
<h3 id="progress"><a id="Progress"></a>Progress&nbsp;to Date</h3>
<p>The records of 28 health care institutions were searched and abstracted to assemble a list of cases occurring in the study time period. Linkage with the list of cohort members has yielded a total of 137 cases: 110 leukemia, 17 myelodysplasia and 10 multiple myelomas. For the approximately 100 deceased cases and controls, interviews with two proxy respondents are conducted: one with the spouse and one with at least one co-worker. An International Diagnostic Review Panel verified 86 leukemias.</p>
<p>Since only about half of the clean-up workers had official doses recorded, independent methods were evaluated for estimation of the doses based on environmental data combined with characteristics of individual exposures obtained through detailed interviews. In addition, laboratories were set up to implement new methods of biological dosimetry: Fluorescence in Situ Hybridization (FISH) technique on blood samples and Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) Spectroscopy measurements of tooth enamel. Both approaches proved to be helpful but not sensitive enough to measure the low doses that were received by a substantial number of clean-up workers. The current approach is to use a recently developed method called RADRUE (Radiation Dose Reconstruction with Uncertainty Estimates), based on the detailed interviews with the subjects. RADRUE provides estimates of subjects' bone marrow doses and of the attendant uncertainties.</p>
<p>A decision was made to accrue additional cases for the next six years, bringing the total time of follow-up to twenty years. This second phase uses the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine to identify the cases.</p>
<p>The ERR/Gy for all leukemia in the initial phase of the study was found to be 3.44/Gy (95% CI: 0.47, 9.78). Risk estimates were elevated for both types of cases (CLL: ERR/Gy=4.09; 95% CI: 0, 14.4, and non-CLL ERR/Gy=2.73;95% CI: 0, 13.5). A publication combining data from the initial and later phases of the leukemia study is in preparation.</p>
<p>The clean-up workers sent to the site and/or residing nearby in 1986-87 also sustained some exposure to internal radiation, raising the possibility that thyroid cancer risk might also be elevated in this population. We are completing a pilot study to investigate the feasibility of launching a new study to investigate this hypothesis in the liquidator cohort.</p>
<p>The study is based in Kiev, in the Research Center for Radiation Medicine, Academy of Medical Sciences of Ukraine and includes a collaboration with the National Cancer Registry of Ukraine.</p>

<h3 id="benefits"><a id="Benefits"></a>Benefits&nbsp;to Ukrainians</h3>
<p>The major benefit to Ukrainians and the scientific community at large is that the study will address concerns about the health effects of the accident on the workers who were involved with the clean-up. Other benefits include the establishment of a leukemia registry set up to identify all the cases that occurred during 1987-2000. A panel of international experts has provided local hematologists with a valuable opportunity for professional interaction. Publications describing the findings provide important new data \on the risks associated with low-dose, protracted exposure to external radiation.</p>

</div>
<p>Data on heritable effects following nuclear accidents are important for understanding fully the consequences of parental exposure to ionizing radiation. However, few studies to date have had adequate statistical power to detect effects of the magnitude expected based on animal data, and most have not been of low-dose, protracted exposures associated with nuclear accidents and environmental exposures. Moreover, they have not taken advantage of the new genomic technologies that are capable of surveying the landscape of both the genome and transcriptome, including somatic alterations.</p>
<p>In Chernobyl-exposed areas of Ukraine and Belarus, excess minisatellite mutations have been reported, by some but not all studies, in children born after the accident. To pursue this observation and to generate new data on heritable effects of parental radiation exposure, investigators are&nbsp;carrying out a study of parent-child trios in which at least one parent was exposed to Chernobyl radiation as a clean-up worker (mean dose&gt;=100 mGy) and/or evacuee from a contaminated area (mean &gt;= 50 mGy). The aim is to investigate the heritable and <em>de novo</em> mutation rates of the spectrum of genetic variants in trios, in particular looking at effects in children and mapping them to possible parental origin of the chromosome.</p>
<p>In collaboration with the Research Center for Radiation Medicine in Ukraine, REB investigators have collected&nbsp;blood and/or buccal cell samples and epidemiologic data for 220 out of the planned&nbsp;450 trios of parents with preconception doses and their unexposed offspring to date. Doses to the gonads from the time of the accident to the time of conception have been&nbsp;reconstructed for all parents, both&nbsp;clean-up workers (also referred to&nbsp;as&nbsp;&ldquo;liquidators&rdquo;) and evacuees. The study is using&nbsp;state-of-the-art genomic technologies to characterize the genomes of the trios to determine whether parental radiation exposure is associated with genetic mutations in the offspring.

</div>
<p>A major health effect of the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident is the increase in incidence of thyroid cancer, particularly among those exposed to radioactive fallout as children or adolescents. Studies of this population, carried out by REB and the Institute of Endocrinology and Metabolism in Ukraine, have found a strong, linear relationship between individual I-131 thyroid dose and risk of thyroid cancer that remains elevated two decades after exposure (Brenner et al., 2011). The investigators estimate that half of incident cancers in the cohort could be attributed to I-131 exposure. A parallel study in Belarus found a similarly strong association for prevalent thyroid cancers (Zablotska et al., 2011).</p>
<p>To date, the molecular signatures as well as the mechanisms underlying this association remain poorly understood. Jointly with colleagues at IEM, Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology, and University of Pittsburgh, we recently conducted studies of mRNA expression and targeted somatic alterations using DNA and RNA aliquots extracted from tumor/normal pairs drawn from 62 Ukrainian cases received through the Chernobyl Tissue Bank (CTB) (Abend et al., 2012; Abend et al., 2013; Leeman-Neill et al., 2013; Leeman-Neill et al., 2014). For the first time, we were able to link altered gene expression with individual I-131 doses; we identified and validated 11 genes with evidence of differential (tumor/normal tissue) dose-expression (Abend et al., 2012), and an additional eight genes in tumor tissue and six genes in normal tissue exhibiting dose-expression associations (Abend et al., 2013). We further evaluated dose-response relationship for known somatic alterations that may occur in sporadic and radiation-related thyroid cancer (<em>BRAF</em>, <em>RAS</em> point mutations and <em>RET/PTC,</em> <em>PAX8/PPARG </em>rearrangements). We reported a significant inverse association between I-131 dose and either <em>BRAF </em>or <em>RAS </em>point mutations as well as a significant concave association with I-131 dose for <em>RET/PTC</em> and <em>PAX8/PPARG </em>chromosomal rearrangements (Leeman-Neill et al., 2013). In an early pilot study of RNA-seq analysis in two UkrAm cases, we identified an additional rearrangement, an <em>ETV6</em>-<em>NTRK3</em> fusion that was then confirmed by qRT-PCR to be present in 15% of all cases (Leeman-Neill et al., 2014).</p>
<p>Following up on these focused genetic studies, REB researchers are conducting a large-scale study of comprehensive genomic characterization of radiation-related PTCs using a combination of biological samples and information on radiation exposure, clinical, and demographic characteristics from the CTB. The primary objective of the study is to evaluate genomic, transcriptomic, and epigenomic landscapes of 450 radiation-related PTCs using the whole genome sequencing technologies and to compare these with sporadic, unrelated to radiation exposure PTCs (500 TCGA and 50 CTB cases from the Ukraine) and across different levels of I-131 exposure. The study has the potential to provide unique insights into the mechanisms of radiation carcinogenesis and to generate a rich data resource.</p>

<p>The accident of April 26, 1986 at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine was the most severe ever to have occurred in the civilian nuclear power industry (UNSCEAR 2008). It happened during a routine test, intended to demonstrate how long the turbines would spin after a power loss. Prior to the test, the automatic shutdown mechanisms had been disabled. Improper, unstable operation of the reactor, which itself had design flaws, allowed an uncontrollable power surge to occur, resulting in steam explosions that completely destroyed the reactor.</p>
<h3><strong>Occupational Exposures and Health Effects</strong></h3>
<p>Two workers died in the immediate aftermath, and high doses of radiation to 134 plant staff and emergency personnel resulted in acute radiation syndrome that rapidly proved fatal for 28 of them. In addition to this group of emergency workers, several hundred thousand were involved in clean-up operations during the first four years following the accident. These workers were exposed to both external radiation and to radioiodines. The incidence of leukemia, thyroid cancer, and cataracts among groups of clean-up workers has been the subject of epidemiologic studies.</p>
<h3><strong>Environmental Exposures and Health Effects</strong></h3>
<p>The accident also caused the largest uncontrolled atmospheric releases of radioactive materials ever recorded for any civilian operation. Two radionuclides, short-lived iodine-131 (<sup>131</sup>I with a half-life of eight days) and long-lived cesium-137 (<sup>137</sup>Cs with a half-life of 30 years), were particularly significant with respect to the environmental contamination and to the radiation doses they delivered to vast numbers of people. The atmospheric releases lasted about 10 days, during which time the wind changed direction several times. This, coupled with rainfall, led to widespread, substantial contamination of an area within approximately 300 miles of the plant, principally to northern Ukraine, Belarus and parts of Russia (see map of <sup>137</sup>Cs fallout on the ground). The radioactive clouds further dispersed over the entire northern hemisphere, depositing lesser amounts of radioactive material over large areas of the former Soviet Union and some other countries in Europe.</p>
<p>For the short-lived <sup>131</sup>I, the main pathway of human exposure was via the transfer of&nbsp;material deposited on pasture grass to cow&rsquo;s milk. Young children residing in contaminated areas, who consume relatively large quantities of fresh cow&rsquo;s milk, received high thyroid doses of <sup>131</sup>I because iodine concentrates in the thyroid, and their thyroid mass is small. Since the Chernobyl accident, there has been a striking increase in the reported incidence of thyroid cancer among children who resided in parts of Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine.</p>

<p>The increase in the reported incidence of thyroid cancer started some four to five years after the accident and has continued to manifest itself. As the underlying incidence rate of thyroid cancer in young children is normally very low, many of the cases diagnosed before age 15 have been attributed to the releases from the Chernobyl accident.&nbsp;As of 2005, four thousand cases of thyroid cancer have resulted, including 15 thyroid cancer deaths. Several thousands more are expected to develop among people who were children when the accident occurred. A number of epidemiologic studies of thyroid cancer and other thyroid diseases have been or are being conducted in Belarus and in Ukraine. To date, there has been no persuasive evidence of any health effect, other than thyroid cancer, that can be attributed to radioactive releases from the Chernobyl accident (UNSCEAR 2008). However, the accident is presumably the cause of a range of mental health issues, among both workers and members of the public.</p>

<p>Pedro Saint-Maurice, Ph.D., joined the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch (MEB) as a postdoctoral fellow in October 2016. He obtained his Ph.D. in kinesiology at Iowa State University in 2013 under the supervision of Gregory Welk. He subsequently worked as a research consultant, establishing research collaborations/consulting services between the Physical Activity and Health Promotion Laboratory at Iowa State University and the Cooper Institute, located in Dallas, Texas. His dissertation work focused on developing more accurate methods to build/test physical activity measures for epidemiology research and culminated with the creation and calibration of an online instrument called the Youth Activity Profile (YAP) that is now being used as part of a large childhood obesity campaign in the NFL PLAY60 FITNESSGRAM project. &nbsp;In MEB, Dr. Saint-Maurice is working under the mentorship of <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/A-J/matthews-charles">Charles E. Matthews</a>, Ph.D., senior investigator.&nbsp;His research focuses on understanding the dose-response relationship between physical activity and different chronic diseases, including cancer. Dr. Saint-Maurice is also interested in different physical activity measurement tools and the impact of measurement error when studying the benefits of physical activity for health.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Gastric and esophageal cancers are the 2nd and 6th most common causes of cancer death in the world, respectively, and together they kill over 1 million people each year. DCEG investigators' participation in UGI cancer research began with the Nutrition Intervention Trials (1985-1991) in Linxian, China, two randomized multivitamin/mineral supplementation trials in a population with some of the highest rates of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and gastric cardia cancer in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;DCEG investigators have since expanded their research to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Etiologic studies of ESCC (focused on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) exposure) and gastric cancer (focused on the effects of <i>H. pylori</i> and gut hormones)&nbsp;</li>
<li>Etiological studies of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) and its precursor, Barrett's esophagus</li>
<li>Genetic studies (including genome-wide association studies) of esophageal and gastric cancer&nbsp;</li>
<li>Development of an endoscopic early detection and treatment program for esophageal squamous dysplasia, the precursor of ESCC, which is now used to screen 100,000 adults in China each year</li>
</ul>

<p>The Clinical Epidemiology Unit (CEU) conducts etiologic research with potential clinical and public health applications, and leads studies evaluating population-based early detection and cancer prevention strategies.</p>
<p>CEU has a strong focus on studies of absolute cancer risk, ranging from discovery of risk markers to assay development and evaluation, with the goal of guiding promising markers into clinical and public health use. Risk markers may include genetics, epidemiologic factors, molecular biomarkers, imaging, or any routine clinical test. The risk estimates ultimately inform the development of risk-based guidelines. CEU investigators are actively involved in developing screening and management guidelines for gynecological cancers.</p>
<p>Current research areas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Molecular epidemiology of HPV and multi-stage pathogenesis of related cancers</li>
<li>Screening and prevention of anogenital cancers</li>
<li>Etiologic heterogeneity and cell of origin of ovarian cancers</li>
<li>Evaluation of risk prediction and early detection strategies for ovarian cancers, in high risk women (<em>BRCA</em> carriers) and in the general population, using novel approaches like lower genital tract sampling</li>
<li>Risk prediction and early detection strategies for endometrial cancer that can be applied to individuals at increased risk, either genetic (e.g. Lynch Syndrome) or non-genetic (high BMI, irregular bleeding)</li>
<li>Molecular classification of gynecological cancers</li>
<li>Studies evaluating novel methodologic approaches to applying risk markers for clinical and public health use</li>

<p>Despite HPV vaccines, screening will remain central for decades to control cervical cancer. Recently, HPV testing alone or with cytology was introduced in the U.S. as an alternative to cytology screening. However, most HPV infections are harmless and additional tests are required to identify women at highest cancer risk. With three options for primary screening, and without clear strategies for triage of screen-positive women, there is great confusion about the best approach. Also, increasing HPV vaccination coverage will lead to lower cervical cancer prevalence and predictive value of a positive screen, and force new screening approaches. Therefore, we propose to evaluate performance of several promising biomarkers head-to-head in a screening population. We will follow 70,000 women from Kaiser Permanente Northern California and store &ldquo;discard&rdquo; cytology and HPV test specimens. This is an expansion of the infrastructure and existing agreements from the ongoing <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=491125" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7276232" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="491125" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="491125">HPV Persistence and Progression (PaP) cohort</a>. The new phase of the cohort study will be the only U.S. effort and the largest study in the world to evaluate comprehensively candidate cervical cancer screening and triage biomarkers. The proposed effort addresses important gaps of knowledge identified in recent guidelines and will impact screening practice. Furthermore, the cohort will be an important resource for ongoing and future etiologic work on HPV-related cancers, particularly the work on HPV viral and host genetics, epigenetics, and cervicovaginal microbiome.</p>

<p>A genome-wide association study (GWAS) is an approach to compare the genomes from many different people to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1061078" sys_contentid="1061078" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7276156" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1061078" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475">find genetic markers associated with a particular phenotype or risk of disease</a>. The goal is to understand how genes contribute to the disease and to use that understanding to help develop better prevention and treatment strategies.</p>
<p>The Division maintains a robust research program including GWAS for a number of cancers, and more recently, exposures and survival. Researchers apply fine-mapping and deep sequencing techniques to regions or loci identified by these scans to pinpoint the specific functional variants responsible for disease risk and the biologic mechanisms involved.</p>
<p>Large-scale consortial arrangements make it possible to combine study resources in a coordinated intramural/extramural approach that enables rapid replication of positive findings using independent data sets. When reproducible findings emerge, the pooling of data sets provides the statistical power to quantify the risks associated with specific gene variants and exposures, and enables subset analyses that can uncover gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. This collaborative infrastructure presents the cancer research community with an extraordinary opportunity to advance research while taking advantage of economies of scale. It also provides an opportunity for NCI to partner with other NIH institutes to investigate a series of complex diseases and traits including diabetes, cardiovascular, neurological disorders, obesity, and smoking behaviors.</p>
<p>By making the data available through rapid posting, NIH can leverage its resources to ensure that the dramatic advances in genomics are incorporated into rigorous population-based studies. Ultimately, findings from these studies may yield new preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic interventions for cancer.</p>

<p>Building on its long history of <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/public-health-impact/hereditary-syndromes">mapping susceptibility genes in cancer-prone families</a>, DCEG investigators were some of the first in the early 2000s to adopt the emerging technology of genome-wide association studies (GWAS), a powerful tool for investigating common inherited variation associated with cancer and other diseases.</p>
<p>The first results using this approach were published in <em>Nature Genetics</em> in 2007 as a part of the pilot multi-institutional project known as Cancer Genetic Markers of Susceptibility (CGEMS), an investigation of &gt;500,000 common inherited variants&mdash;known as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)&mdash;and risk of prostate and breast cancer. As the technology improved and processing speed increased, CGEMS expanded to numerous other malignancies, using&nbsp;increasingly complex sequencing techniques.</p>
<p>To accelerate research using the new genetic approaches, DCEG established the NCI <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/programs-hgp/cgr">Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory</a> (CGR) in 2001. The CGR&rsquo;s state-of-the-art robotics and genomics technologies provide rapid, high quality preparation and scanning of hundreds of thousands of samples collected through rigorous epidemiological studies.</p>
<p>Today, genotyping, exome sequencing, and analysis are conducted at CGR and at research facilities across the globe, utilizing the <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/Consortia/cohort.html">massive power of consortia,</a> resulting in the identification of more than 600 susceptibility loci for over 29 types of cancer. Colleagues in the co-located <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/organization/programs-hgp/ltg">Laboratory of Translational Genomics</a> follow up on the markers identified through GWAS to interrogate the functional effects of variants and pinpoint the biological pathways through which these SNPs influence cancer etiology. Perhaps the most enduring discovery produced through GWAS is the ability to utilize SNPs for disease risk stratification and risk prediction.</p>

<p>Somatic studies on kidney cancer utilize tumor samples compiled from various efforts in Italy, the US, Eastern Europe, and Guatemala. As more samples and accompanying exposure information are collected, investigators are able to study increasingly rare cancer subtypes.</p>
<h3>Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC)</h3>
<p>Papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) is the second most common kidney cancer subtype, comprising 10-15 percent&nbsp;of cases. Previous studies have identified two main types of PRCC: Type 1, which is not particularly aggressive, and Type 2, which has a worse prognosis. Further, Type 2 has at least three distinct subtypes with different somatic driver mutations and varying clinical prognoses. DCEG investigators seek to use cutting-edge DNA analysis techniques to further determine the genetic landscape of PRCC tumors and its link with exposures and metastasis.</p>
<h3>Collecting Ducts (CD)</h3>
<p>Collecting Ducts (CD) cancer is an extremely aggressive and rare type of kidney cancer. DCEG investigators have access to tumor samples from dozens of CD cases and use them to conduct whole genome and whole exome studies samples to investigate the tumor landscape also in relation to tumor immune-related cells and metastasis. They are also working towards analyzing cases of high grade urothelial carcinomas in the differential diagnosis of CD, to provide a molecular-based diagnostic tool to correctly distinguish these cancer types.</p>
<h3>Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC)</h3>
<p>Chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) is relatively rare, making up about 5 percent&nbsp;of all cases. It is characterized by slow but persistent growth that is highly resistant to conventional cancer therapies. A tiny fraction of ChRCC is hereditary, with some known driver mutations, but the genetic basis of sporadic ChRCC is largely undiscovered. This type of kidney cancer is similar to renal oncocytoma (benign) and they are often hard to distinguish. Hybrids of the two exist as well, suggesting a common origin. DCEG studies tumor samples, working to provide a grading score based on ChRCC&rsquo;s genetic landscape to distinguish indolent from aggressive cases. Investigators also perform molecular tests to more finely distinguish ChRCC from oncocytomas and identify tumors that have the potential to be more aggressive.</p>

<p>The recognition of cancer as a heterogeneous disease, coupled with technological advances in molecular/genomic profiling of tumors, provides epidemiologists with the opportunity to integrate tissue profiling into etiologic studies to study the carcinogenic process, and pinpoint specific factors associated with risk for developing specific molecular or genomic cancer subtypes. This work is already underway in a number of existing cohort studies, including the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, Ovarian Screening Trial (PLCO). <a href="https://biometry.nci.nih.gov/cdas/learn/plco/biospecimens/">Learn more about the biological samples available through PLCO</a>.</p>
<p><span>In October 2018, the National Cancer Institute convened a group of experts to discuss the current state of the science of mutational signatures in cancer research and related opportunities and challenges. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1130171" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1130171" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7278013" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1130171">Read the Executive Summary of the Tumor Signatures Meeting.</a></span></p>
<p>DCEG investigators are undertaking foundational research to identify novel molecular and genomic signatures in tumors that are&nbsp;linked to germline genetic variants and key environmental exposures. We expect this approach will allow the identification of new risk factors and yield novel insights into biological mechanism of carcinogenesis.</p>
<p>Examples of specific studies include:</p>
<h3>Biliary Cancer</h3>
<p>Tumor tissue collected from populations in China and Chile are being used to examine the genomic landscape of cancer at different sites in the biliary tract and to look for potential molecular subtypes. A better understanding of the genetic and molecular differences across these malignancies can lead to more precise diagnoses and effective treatments, as well as providing clues as to etiology.</p>

<p>Converging lines of evidence suggest that melanoma comprises biologically distinct subtypes arising through multiple causal pathways. The distribution of melanoma subtypes differs by age, anatomical location of the cancer, and sun exposure. Somatic mutation patterns vary across melanoma subtypes, though the large majority of studies suggesting this phenomenon were based on metastatic melanoma alone, due to the difficulty in obtaining sufficient genetic material from thin primary melanomas once they are used for diagnostic review.</p>
<p>To further our understanding of the heterogeneity of melanoma, and to determine a predictive pattern of progression for dysplastic nevi, a melanoma precursor and risk factor, we are conducting tissue-based analyses of precursors, melanoma tumors and metastases within existing study populations. These cases are well annotated with detailed clinical and epidemiological data, and sufficient biological samples.</p>
<p>We are undertaking genetic analyses as well as targeted sequencing of previously identified driver genes for a more comprehensive classification of primary melanomas and the molecular changes associated with metastatic potential. In addition, with the extensive pathology data, particularly on lymphocyte infiltration and presence of other inflammatory cells, we can examine the link between molecular changes and tissue microenvironment.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">In both the absence and presence of screening, the R package calculates individual risks of lung cancer and lung cancer death based on covariates: age, education, sex, race, smoking intensity/duration/quit-years, Body Mass Index, family history of lung-cancer, and self-reported emphysema.&nbsp; In the presence of CT screening akin to the NLST (3 yearly screens, 5 years of follow-up), it uses the covariates to estimate risk of false-positive CT screen as well as the reduction in risk of lung cancer death and increase in risk of lung cancer screening.&nbsp; <br />

<p>The R package and webtool fits Prevalence Incidence Mixture models to left-censored and irregularly interval-censored time to event data that is commonly found in screening cohorts assembled from electronic health records.&nbsp; Absolute and relative risk can be estimated for simple random sampling, &nbsp;and stratified sampling (the two approaches of superpopulation and a finite population are supported for target populations).&nbsp; Non-parametric (absolute risks only), semi-parametric, weakly-parametric (using B-splines), and some fully parametric (such as the logistic-Weibull) models are supported.</p>

<p>Firefighting is a hazardous occupation that involves excess risk of deaths from accidents, cardiovascular disease, and respiratory disease. There is also concern that firefighters may experience excess risk of cancer, particularly since the widespread introduction of synthetic building materials and furnishings. To address this question, DCEG conducted a cohort study examining the mortality rate among 7,789 firefighters employed by the City of Philadelphia between 1910 and 1987. Later, these data were pooled with other studies to form a cohort totaling 29,993 U.S. firefighters. The findings from these studies, to date, suggest that firefighters experience elevated risk of death from leukemia and digestive, respiratory and urinary cancers.</p>

<p>Concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), where large numbers of animals are raised and often confined, are becomingly increasingly common as agriculture becomes more industrialized. Waste (e.g., manure, urine and byproducts), animal husbandry-related products (e.g., feed, pesticides, antibiotics, hormones) and the animals themselves are sources of hazardous emissions into the environment, including microorganisms, endotoxins, air pollutants (e.g., particulate and gaseous emissions), and an array of malodorous compounds. Animal waste from CAFOs is also frequently sprayed onto crop fields, resulting in environmental contamination over large regions. Using Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based models, we are estimating CAFO-derived&nbsp;outdoor air&nbsp;pollution exposures for the Agricultural Health Study cohort and evaluating associations with health outcomes in this rural population.<br /><br />For more information, contact <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1080328" sys_contentid="1080328" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1080328" sys_relationshipid="7249771" sys_variantid="1965">Dr. Rena Jones</a>.</p>

<p>Polychlorinated dibenzo-<em>p</em>-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) are persistent organic pollutants primarily emitted from industrial combustion facilities such as incinerators&nbsp;and coal-fired power plants, and are also by-products of the manufacture and use of polychlorinated biphenyls, paper pulp bleaching, and chlorophenols and chlorophenoxy herbicides. Several PCDD/F congeners are classified by IARC as carcinogenic. However, much of the evidence in human populations, including increased risks of non-Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer, is derived from occupational settings and studies of accidental industrial releases. General population exposures to PCDD/F from non-dietary sources are not well characterized.</p>

Investigators in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch have ongoing efforts to verify the geographic location of PCDD/F-emitting sources in the U.S., improve the characterization of exposure determinants, and validate Geographic Information Systems (GIS)-based exposure metrics with serum measurements. These exposure assessment enhancements support multiple current and future studies of ambient dioxin exposure and cancer risk, including a re-analysis of NHL risk in the NCI SEER-NHL Study, which found an increased risk of NHL with residential proximity to cement kilns.<br /><br />For more information, contact <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=1080328" sys_contentid="1080328" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1080328" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7274888" sys_variantid="1965">Dr. Rena Jones</a>.</p>

<p>Epidemiologic investigations of environment-cancer relationships rely on accurate, quantifiable exposure measurements. Such studies may use Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and regulatory and other environmental monitoring data to complement retrospective surveys, which are sometimes limited by participants&rsquo; knowledge of exposures in their surrounding environments. Cancer studies have benefited from the increasing availability of historical air and water monitoring data, satellite imagery, census, and other geographic datasets that allow for reconstruction of residence- and other location-based exposures over a substantial portion of a person&rsquo;s lifetime.</p>
<p>Investigators in the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch implement GIS-based exposure assessments using georeferenced historical data resources and residential histories collected in our studies of environmental hazards and cancer risk. Our approaches include using GIS and spatial-analytic methods to characterize exposure to environmental risk factors, incorporating space-time-activity information in exposure assessments, and employing biological and environmental measurements for exposure validation. This work addresses important epidemiologic considerations in geography-based environmental exposure assessments, including residential mobility, positional error, and the challenges of extrapolation over space and time.</p>

<p>Somatic copy number alternation (SCNA) is a common feature of the cancer genome and is associated with cancer etiology and prognosis. The allele-specific SCNA analysis of a tumor sample aims to identify the allele-specific copy numbers of both alleles, adjusting for the ploidy and the tumor purity. Next generation sequencing platforms produce abundant read counts at the basepair resolution across the exome or whole genome which is susceptible to hypersegmentation, a phenomenon where numerous regions with very short length are falsely identified as SCNA. This package employs a robust hidden Markov model approach that accounts for hypersegmentation for allele-specific SCNA analysis, and an efficient E-M algorithm procedure that uses a forwardbackward algorithm for evaluating the E-step. The main function that performs this method is hsegHMM_main.</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends annual computed tomography (CT) screening for individuals between 55 and 80 years old with a history of heavy smoking (at least one pack of cigarettes per day for 30 years or more) and who currently smoke or have quit within the past 15 years. However, selecting ever-smokers for screening using individualized lung cancer risk calculations may be more effective and efficient at preventing deaths than current USPSTF recommendations.</p>

<h3>Impact</h3>
<p>Because the researchers estimated that risk-based selection for screening might prevent more lung-cancer deaths, with greater effectiveness and efficiency, than would current screening recommendations, they have created an online lung-cancer screening risk-tool to provide individualized risk information for patients considering entering lung screening.</p>

<h3>Challenge</h3>
<p>As more and more low penetrant common single nucleotide polymorphisms associated with breast cancer risk are discovered through genomics studies, there is a pressing need for an understanding of their utility in guiding public health strategies.</p>

These tools range from a commercial treatment planning system (TPS) to Monte Carlo calculation codes. The system, called the National Cancer Institute dosimetry system for Radiation Treatment (NCIRT), includes two independent modules for photon and proton treatments. Both photon and proton modules are validated by dosimetry measurements in collaboration with clinical institutions. NCIRT is designed for different scenarios of dose reconstruction in which radiological images are available or not available for an epidemiological cohort.</p>

<p>The NCIRF's design addresses limitations in&nbsp;the PCXMC&trade;, an older radiographic dose calculator that was used to derive organ doses for specific types of x-ray examinations using estimates of entrance skin dose described in historical literature. Radiographic fields and x-ray technical parameters for the PCXMC&trade; were based on information from a well-known series of radiographic imaging handbooks. This dosimetry approach was previously used to estimate individual medical doses for the U.S. Radiologic Technologists cohort. The NCIRF method is currently being used to update the organ dosimetry.</p>

<p>Incidence of esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (age standardized rates, per 100,000) for males.</p>
</div>
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Esophageal cancer is the eighth most common cause of cancer worldwide and the sixth most common cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Esophageal cancer kills 400,000 people every year, most of whom live in two distinct geographic bands across central Asia and along the eastern Africa corridor extending from Ethiopia to South Africa. In these high-risk areas, nearly all cases are esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).</p>
<p>ESCC symptoms, such as dysphagia (difficulty swallowing) and weight loss, develop late. Most patients present with advance disease, and survival is usually poor (3-6 months). Afflicted patients are readily identifiable in surgical and medical hospital wards, profoundly wasted and holding spittoon cups to manage secretions.</p>
<p>NCI investigators and others have performed many etiologic, genetic, early detection, and treatment studies of ESCC in central Asia, but this disease remains essentially unstudied in eastern Africa.</p>

<h3><a id="Medical-Radiation-Exposure"></a>Medical Radiation Exposure</h3>
<p>Exposure to diagnostic examinations involving radiation has increased dramatically among the U.S. population. In order to support epidemiological studies of medical radiation and cancer risk, DCEG dosimetry researchers are developing more accurate methods to estimate radiation doses from diagnostic radiologic examinations, such as computed tomography (CT) scans, radiography or fluoroscopically-guided interventional procedures, and nuclear medicine exams. They are also studying how to estimate radiation doses to normal tissues from radiological cancer treatments, including external radiation treatments and therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures, in order to better support studies of second cancers and their possible causes.</p>

<h3><a id="Occupational-Radiation-Exposure"></a>Occupational Radiation Exposure</h3>
<p>There are an estimated 1.5 million radiation workers in the United States, and questions remain about optimal radiation protection strategies for protracted low-dose occupational radiation exposures. The public is also concerned about radiation protection because of ubiquitous, protracted, low-dose exposures from certain medical procedures, air travel, natural background, and other sources. Studies of cancer among occupationally exposed populations are important therefore for radiation protection purposes, and for estimating and projecting risks to the public. DCEG dosimetry researchers in the REB are developing methods to more accurately estimate organ dose and quantify uncertainties for radiation workers exposed to medical radiation procedures and involved in radiation accidents.</p>

<h3><a id="Environmental-Radiation-Exposure"></a>Environmental Radiation Exposure</h3>
<p>Fundamental questions remain unanswered about the potential hazards of low-dose, protracted radiation exposures from environmental radiation sources. The Fukushima nuclear power plant accident was an important reminder of the need to understand the long-term effects of low-dose protracted exposures from radioactive cesium (<sup>137</sup>Cs) deposited on the ground and internal exposure to radionuclides especially radioiodine (<sup>131</sup>I) resulting from the accident. In support of epidemiological studies of cancer risk from environmental radiation exposure, DCEG dosimetry researchers in the REB are developing methods for more accurate dose estimates and for reducing uncertainty in studies of thyroid cancer and other thyroid diseases in persons exposed to radionuclides from the Chernobyl accident and to fallout from nuclear weapons testing.</p>

<h2>Therapeutic Radiation Dosimetry</h2>
<p>DCEG investigators in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=110&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302459" sys_contentid="302459" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302459" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7277140" sys_variantid="1422">Radiation Epidemiology Branch</a> (REB) develop dosimetry methods for patients undergoing therapeutic nuclear medicine procedures, in which a radiative substance (radionuclide) is introduced into the body either intravenously or orally, and that substance emits ionizing radiation within a small area inside the body. Dosimetry for nuclear medicine requires biokinetic models for given radionuclides and organ dose coefficients, which convert radionuclide uptake to absorbed dose.</p>
<p>REB investigators are developing different biokinetic models specific to epidemiological study cohorts and a library of dose coefficients by using Monte Carlo radiation transport techniques combined with computational human phantoms. By using comprehensive dose coefficients coupled with an <span>International Commission on Radiological Protection </span>(ICRP) reference biokinetic model, REB investigators are developing a user-friendly computer program, titled National Cancer Institute dosimetry system for Nuclear Medicine (NCINM).&nbsp; The methods have been used for dose estimates to the thyroid, active bone marrow, and other organs for a cohort of 35,593 hyperthyroid patients. The dose estimates will be used for dose-response risk assessment in the extended follow-up of cancer mortality risks among patients with hyperthyroidism treated with <sup>131</sup>I.</p>

<p><strong>A Subregion-based Burden Test for Simultaneous Identification of Susceptibility Loci and Sub-regions within </strong></p>
<p>In rare-variant association studies, aggregating rare and/or low frequency variants, may increase statistical power for detection of the underlying susceptibility gene or region. However, it&rsquo;s unclear which variants, or class of them, in a gene contribute most to the association. We proposed a subregion-based burden test (REBET) to simultaneously select susceptibility genes and identify important underlying sub-regions. The sub-regions are predefined based on shared common biologic characteristics, such as the protein domain or possible functional impact.&nbsp; Based on a subset-based approach considering local correlations between combinations of test statistics of sub-regions, REBET is able to properly control the type I error rate while adjusting for multiple comparisons in a computationally efficient manner. Simulation studies show that REBET can achieve power competitive to alternative methods when rare variants cluster within sub-regions. In two case studies, REBET is able to identify known disease susceptibility genes, and more importantly pinpoint the unreported most susceptible sub-regions, which represent protein domains essential for gene function.</p>

With his mentorship, my research focused on using cancer registry linkages and other large databases to study cancer in solid organ transplant recipients and HIV-infected individuals.</p>
<p><strong><em>What is your current position?</em></strong><br />I am an Assistant Professor at Washington University in St. Louis with my primary appointment in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and a co-appointment in the Division of Public Health Sciences.&nbsp;I am currently developing research investigating risk factors for the development of rotator cuff disease.&nbsp;I also provide epidemiology&nbsp;and biostatistics expertise to clinical investigators interested in a range of research questions related to musculoskeletal disease.</p>
<p><strong><em>How do you apply the skills you developed at DCEG in your current job?</em></strong><br />Even though my research has transitioned to a different topical focus, I&rsquo;m heavily using skills I developed or enhanced at DCEG. While at DCEG, I sharpened my communication skills, improved my ability to defend my methodologic approaches, and gained experience developing and pursuing my own research ideas. All these skills are now vital to my success in my current job.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you have any memories from your fellowship that you would like to share?</em></strong><br />I really appreciated the amount of support I received during my academic job search, which can be a long and grueling process.&nbsp;Eric, my mentor, helped me think through my options and career goals and reviewed my application materials. He and others in my branch gave me important feedback during dry runs of my job talk.&nbsp;<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349643" sys_contentid="349643" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349643" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7104850">Jackie Lavigne, Ph.D., M.P.H.</a>,&nbsp;provided me with invaluable counsel during my negotiation process. All of this really proved to me the extent to which DCEG values the aspirations and futures of their fellows.</p>
<p><strong><em>What do you do in your free time?</em></strong><br />My husband and I are expecting our first child in January. So I am &lsquo;nesting&rsquo; and also enjoying lazy weekend mornings while I still have them!</p>
<p><strong><em>Do you have any advice for current or future DCEG fellows?</em></strong><br />Take advantage of the wealth of educational opportunities that are available during your fellowship.&nbsp;DCEG (and NIH in general) is unique in the quantity and quality of seminars, workshops, and short-courses that are targeted towards fellows. Through some of these programs I gained training in grant-writing, mentoring, communicating with the media, and teaching&mdash;just to name a few. Most of these types of skills will serve you well regardless of your future career direction, and you likely will not have the same array of opportunities (or time to take advantage of them) once you move on from your fellowship.</p>

Each member of this unique cohort had individual direct thyroid measurements of <sup>131</sup>I activity in thyroid gland taken shortly after the accident. Recent efforts have been focused on improving estimated radiation doses to the thyroid from all exposure pathways and evaluating uncertainties in thyroid doses from intake of <sup>131</sup>I, which contributes about 90% of the total thyroid dose.</p>
<p>Key improvements included:</p>

<li>Use of an expanded questionnaire to capture more detailed residential history and consumption of important dietary components;</li>
<li>Use of geographic region, age, and gender-specific values of thyroid masses derived from approximately 120,000 thyroid volume measurements of children obtained in Belarus and Ukraine;</li>
<li>Comprehensive reanalysis of the direct radiation thyroid measurements; and</li>
<li>Preparation of a database of meteorological and radiation measurements done during the first three months following the accident.</li>
</ul>
<p>The average thyroid dose was 0.65 Gy (0.00035 &ndash; 42 Gy) in 13,204 persons in the Ukrainian screening cohort and an average thyroid dose of 0.68 Gy (0.0005 &ndash; 39 Gy) in 11,732 persons in the Belarusian cohort.

To further pursue this observation and to generate new data on the heritable effects of parental radiation exposure, DCEG investigators are carrying out a study of up to 450 trios of parents with preconception doses and their unexposed offspring. The aim is to investigate the heritable and <em>de novo</em> mutation rates of the spectrum of genetic variants in trios looking at effects in children and mapping them to possible parental origin of the chromosome. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1030547" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1030547" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7275620" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1030547">Read more details about the TRIO study</a>.

<p>DCEG investigators in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) coordinated a study of health effects in persons exposed to Chernobyl fallout <em>in utero</em> and early life in Belarus (2,964 subjects) and in Ukraine (2,582 subjects). They applied comprehensive efforts to develop a complex dosimetry system for these cohort studies, recontructing the following individual doses for each cohort member:</p>
<ul>
<li>Doses to the fetus's thyroid gland from intake of <sup>131</sup>I by mothers; and</li>
<li>Postnatal (if applicable) dose to the thyroid gland from intake of <sup>131</sup>I by the infant from breast milk and other foodstuffs.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, in Belarus, investigators reconstructed thyroid and whole-body doses due to prenatal and postnatal external irradiation from gamma-emitting radionuclides deposited on the ground, and prenatal and postnatal intake of long-lived cesium isotopes (<sup>134</sup>Cs and <sup>137</sup>Cs). The estimates of <em>in utero</em> thyroid doses from <sup>131</sup>I intakes were derived from the model recommended by the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) Publication 88 with account to maternal direct thyroid gland measurements of <sup>131</sup>I activity, if available. Mean <em>in utero</em> thyroid doses for cohort members from intakes of <sup>131</sup>I by the mothers were estimated to be 106 mGy in Belarus (preliminary) and 72 mGy in Ukraine (Likhtarov et al. 2011). Special efforts are underway to evaluate uncertainty in reconstructed questionnaire-based doses due possibly to poor memory recall of mother during dosimetry interview (Drozdovitch et al. 2016).</p>

<p>Certain types of human papillomavirus (HPV) cause almost all cases of cervical cancer, as well as cancers at other anatomic sites in men and women. Vaccines that protect against HPV can substantially reduce the risk of cervical cancer, and other cancers attributable to HPV infection. However, HPV vaccination rates are too low, especially in countries with very high rates of cervical cancer and low resources. These vaccines are expensive&mdash;many countries cannot afford them&mdash;more than one dose is needed, and giving multiple doses can be difficult, <em>especially</em> in low resource settings. Researchers are conducting a new study in order to determine if one dose of the HPV vaccines works as well as giving two doses of these vaccines to young women.</p>
<h3>Potential Public Health Impact</h3>
<p>If one dose of an HPV vaccine were found to be sufficient to reduce cervical cancer burden, we would expect more widespread vaccine uptake in the United States, and around the world, with vaccination programs being able to operate at an overall lower cost.</p>
<p>Additionally, findings from the trial may make it possible for future evaluations of one-dose HPV vaccination to be smaller-scale immunogenicity trials, rather than efficacy trials, which could expedite expansion to other populations, ages, and vaccine formulations.</p>
<p>Finally, these findings could transform the current vaccine development paradigm by providing the first example of a single-dose subunit vaccine that induces durable protective immunity.</p>
<h3>Study Design</h3>
<p>There are two components to the study: (1) a controlled, randomized, double-blinded non-inferiority clinical trial to compare one-dose to two-dose vaccination; and (2) a concurrent epidemiologic survey for HPV <em>infection</em> status among unvaccinated women.</p>
<p>The trial will enroll 20,000 girls 12 to 16 years old residing in Costa Rica. Participants will be randomized in two stages to one of four arms (one dose of the bivalent vaccine, two doses of the bivalent vaccine, one dose of the nonavalent vaccine and two doses of the nonavalent vaccine); the first randomization at enrollment will assign participants to one of the two study vaccines and at the second visit they will be randomized to one or two doses. Girls randomized to the one dose arm will receive an active control (i.e. Tdap) at the time of the second vaccine dose. After vaccination, girls will be followed every six months for four years to assess the presence of persistent cervical HPV infections and antibody titers, by dose group and vaccine type. In the U.S., Cervarix<sup>&reg;</sup> and GARDASIL<sup>&reg;</sup>9 are currently approved for two doses in younger recipients and three doses in older recipients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The epidemiologic HPV survey will enroll a group of unvaccinated females from the same geographic areas; they will range in age from 17 to 20. These females will attend two study visits six months apart to determine their HPV DNA status; there will be no additional follow-up. These females will be offered HPV vaccination at the enrollment and six-month study visits.</p>
<p>At each visit, participants will fill out a questionnaire and give a urine sample. They may give blood samples. The older participants will use a swab to collect cells from their cervix and vagina.</p>
<h3><strong>Study Rationale and Background</strong></h3>
<p>The impetus for this trial stemmed from the NCI Costa Rica Vaccine Trial, a phase-III efficacy trial that launched in 2004; in post-hoc analyses, investigators from that trial reported that one or two doses may be efficacious and that antibody titers remained elevated for years after a single vaccine dose. The latter finding was particularly novel and unexpected, given that previous subunit vaccines have typically required more than one dose (prime/boost regimen) to induce lasting responses.</p>
<p>* ESCUDDO (&ldquo;<u>Es</u>tudio de <u>C</u>omparacion de <u>U</u>na y <u>D</u>os <u>D</u>osis de Vacunas Contra el Virus de Papiloma Humano (VPH)&rdquo;) is a scientific evaluation of one or two doses of vaccine against human papillomavirus.</p>
<p><a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03180034">Clinical trials identifier: NCT03180034 </a></p>
<p>ESCUDDO is co-funded by the NCI and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, with support from the International Agency for Research on Cancer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Investigators in DCEG are conducting studies related to regions affected by radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing.</p>
<h3><a id="Trinity"></a>Trinity Nuclear Test, New Mexico</h3>
<p>Investigators from DCEG and across the NCI are estimating radiation doses from fallout in New Mexico following the July 1945 test by the U.S. government of the first atomic weapon. The test was code-named Trinity. DCEG investigators have carried out in-depth interviews to ascertain the typical diet of populations living in New Mexico in the mid-1940s. These interviews are an important step in developing estimates of low, intermediate, radiation doses resulting from Trinity. To determine how best to collect these data, DCEG investigators have engaged in discussions with academics with expertise in Native American and Hispanic lifestyles in the 1940s, as well as advocates and local community leaders. The study quantitatively will estimate the number of cancer cases in New Mexico (past and future) that may be related to the nuclear test. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=728725" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="728725" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7276422" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="728725">Find more detailed information on Trinity</a>.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators estimated radiation dose and risk from atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted in the Republic of the Marshall Islands from 1946 through 1958. This effort included a detailed assessment of all historical and contemporary measurements of environmental radiation on all atolls of the Marshall Islands as well as the use of a model of atmospheric dispersion and deposition. Results from these analyses were published in the August 2010 issue of <em>Health Physics</em>.</p>

<h3><a id="Semipalatinsk"></a>Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test, Kazakhstan</h3>
<p>DCEG investigators together with investigators from Kazakhstan and Russia are studying thyroid disease prevalence and radiation dose in a cohort of 2,994 subjects exposed at young ages to radioactive fallout from nuclear weapons testing during 1949-1962 at the Semipalatinsk Nuclear Test Site in northeastern Kazakhstan. Radiation exposure to the thyroid gland was from external radiation sources on the ground and other surfaces, and internally from radioactive iodine taken up by the thyroid gland following ingestion of milk from dairy animals grazing on contaminated pasture. Preliminary point estimates of individual external and internal dose averaged 0.04 Gy (range 0-0.65) and 0.31 Gy (0-9.6), respectively. Ultrasound-detected thyroid nodule prevalence, 18% among males and 39% among females, was significantly and independently associated with both external and internal exposure.</p>
<h3><a id="Risk-Calculator"></a>Thyroid Dose and Risk Calculator for Nuclear Weapons Fallout</h3>
<p>Between 1945 and 1980, the U.S., the U.S.S.R., the U.K., France and China carried out more than 500 atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons totaling the explosive equivalent of 440 megatons of TNT. These tests emitted radioactive material into the atmosphere, much of which became widely dispersed before being deposited as fallout. DCEG investigators developed an <a href="https://radiationcalculators.cancer.gov/fallout/">online calculator to estimate the radiation dose received by the thyroid gland from radionuclides in fallout from nuclear tests</a>. The early version of this tool estimated exposure and risk from fallout from the Nevada Test Site. In 2017, investigators released a new version of the tool that includes exposures from sites outside of the United States (global fallout).</p>
<h3><a id="Dose-Reconstruction"></a>Dose Reconstruction and Health Consequences from Fallout</h3>
<p>In collaboration with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, DCEG investigators estimated, for the first time, the radiation doses and risks of related health effects to representative persons in all counties of the contiguous United States from a set of important radionuclides produced from the testing of nuclear weapons from 1951 through 1962 by the United States and other nations. The findings of this feasibility study suggest that the health risks from exposure to fallout from past nuclear weapons tests may be small, but that it is technically feasible to conduct a detailed study of the health effects on the American people. The draft of this technical report was peer reviewed by the National Academy of Sciences/National Research Council (NAS/NRC) Committee. To the extent possible, the Committee&rsquo;s recommendations were taken into account in the final report.

As part of this effort, the investigators estimated organ doses received by patients who underwent nuclear medicine diagnostic exams over a 50-year period (1960&ndash;2010). They calculated radiation doses per examination to 14 organs, for 17 examination types, using different radiopharmaceuticals (also called radionuclides). The investigators determined the percentage of use of each radiopharmaceutical and the administered activity of the radiopharmaceutical based on a comprehensive literature review and International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) dose coefficients.</p>

<p>The second version of human phantoms, called physical human phantoms, are made of stackable layers (called "slices"), each one dotted with a grid of holes into which tiny radiation sensors called dosimeters are inserted. This kind of physical phantom can be used to provide accurate dose measurements when placed in a CT scanner or other source of radiation, but time and cost are substantial considerations. In addition, physical phantoms available for purchase are limited in their sizes and features. So REB investigators are exploring the feasibility of producing 3D-print tissue blocks radiologically equivalent to human tissues. The 3D-printed tissue blocks could be used to customize physical phantoms to simulate features such as women's breast tissue and fat tissue for both male and females, enabling them to match computational human phantoms with varying body sizes.</p>

<h3><a id="Monte-Carlo"></a>Monte Carlo Simulation Methods</h3>
<p>Monte Carlo is a class of numerical simulation methods used widely to solve complex physical and math problems. REB investigators are using three-dimensional Monte Carlo radiation transport. Detailed radiation propagation is modeled with Monte Carlo methods in computer simulations. This is a flexible and rigorous approach to simulate radiation transport within different materials, including human anatomy. The computational approach is extremely useful, particularly in dose reconstruction for large-scale epidemiological studies, where dose measurements are not feasible. REB investigators are using this method in dosimetry research&nbsp;to support several epidemiological studies of medical, occupational, and environmental exposure scenarios.</p>
<h3><a id="Uncertainties"></a>Uncertainties in Doses</h3>
<p>Radiation doses calculated for epidemiological studies are associated with uncertainties because it is impossible to obtain precise and complete data for exposure assessment. For this reason, REB investigators are using Monte Carlo simulation methods to incorporate dosimetric uncertainties into radiation dose estimates. When incorporating uncertainty, some parameters associated with dose reconstruction are shared by cohort members and some are not. By using the two-dimensional Monte Carlo (2DMC) sampling method, the two types of parameters can be sampled separately and utilized for dose estimations. Multiple plausible doses (called realizations) are derived from the process, which then are used for risk analysis.</p>
<h3><a id="Radiation-Measurements"></a>Radiation Measurements</h3>
<p>REB investigators are using radiation measurements to validate radiation doses derived using computational methods. Instruments for radiation measurement available at REB are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Physical anthropomorphic phantoms representing a 5-year-old child and an adult</li>
<li>Female breast phantoms specialized for dose measurement in breast radiotherapy</li>
<li>Different types of dosimeters such as optically-stimulated luminescence dosimeter (OSLD) and ion chamber dosimeters; OSLD reading systems; and medical radiation spectrum measurement systems</li>
</ul>
<p>Irradiation of physical phantoms equipped with dosimeters is conducted in collaboration with the NIH Clinical Center, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and several medical facilities outside the NIH. Dose measurements using the equipment have been used to validate radiation doses computed for fluoroscopy, computed tomography, and radiation treatment procedures. &nbsp;<br /><br />In addition, DCEG investigators are constructing physical anthropomorphic phantoms in-house using 3D printing techniques for more accurate and customized dose comparison with computational human phantoms.</p>

The accident at the Chernobyl plant in April 1986 released massive amounts of radioactive material into the environment. The general population, particularly children, were exposed to internal radioactive iodine (I-131), primarily through consumption of contaminated milk. Because the thyroid gland uses iodine to synthesize thyroid hormones, iodine concentrates in this organ. However, the thyroid gland cannot distinguish between the radioactive and inert forms of iodine, so iodine-deficient populations may be subject to higher accumulations of radioactive I-131. Through a long-term, multi-country, international collaboration, we are comprehensively evaluating radiation-related risks of thyroid disease in individuals exposed to Chernobyl fallout as children and adolescents.</p>

Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is the primary environmental risk factor for most types of skin cancers, which occur in approximately five million people and result in over ten thousand deaths each year in the U.S. Sensitivity to sunlight is influenced not only by constitutional characteristics such as skin complexion, but also by exposure to some potentially modifiable factors like photosensitizing medications, which reduce the minimal UVR dose needed to produce an erythemal response, or reddening of the skin, and potentially increase the risk of photocarcinogenesis. Using a large nationwide administrative dataset, we have planned a series of comprehensive analyses of photosensitizing medications in relation to the most UV-sensitive cancers, keratinocyte carcinomas and their precursors (e.g., actinic keratosis).</p>

<p>Pancreatic cancer is a rapidly fatal tumor that causes a substantial public health burden worldwide. In the U.S., it's among the few cancers whose incidence are increasing. Because the pancreas is a metabolically important organ, many dietary and metabolic hypotheses have been posited for this cancer. Epidemiologic studies are challenging, both because of concerns about reverse causality related to latent disease and because most cohort studies lack substantial case numbers. In order to evaluate risk factors for this cancer, DCEG investigators in the Metabolic Epidemiology Branch have taken advantage of prospective data from DCEG cohorts and pooled consortia.<br /><br />Recent findings for pancreatic cancer have included temporal trends over the past 40 years by demographics and histologic types using data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results registries, positive associations for childhood and early adulthood BMI, and identification of 20 risk signals in individuals of European descent within genome-wide associations studies. The diabetes associated with PDAC may be more heterogeneous than previously appreciated. In addition to Type 2 diabetes related to insulin resistance and adiposity, diabetes related to pancreatogenic disease and common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes related to maturity onset diabetes of the young contributes to the association between diabetes and pancreatic cancer.</p>

What did you work on?</strong></em><br />I completed my dissertation research in the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (now <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=1033171" sys_contentid="1033171" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1033171" sys_variantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7104844">Metabolic Epidemiology Branch</a>) under the mentorship of <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_contentid=349636" sys_contentid="349636" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="349636" sys_variantid="1965" sys_relationshipid="7104841">Rachael Stolzenberg-Solomon, Ph.D., M.P.H., R.D.</a>,&nbsp;where I studied associations between folate or one-carbon metabolism and risk of colorectal and renal cancers.

<p><em><strong>What is your current position?</strong></em><br />I am an Assistant Member (equivalent to Assistant Professor) at St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. The goal of my research is to better understand the long-term health of childhood cancer survivors, who have increased risk of serious late health effects due to the potentially complex interactions of treatment-related toxicity, genetic susceptibility and lifestyle-related factors, and then to develop and test intervention strategies to reduce their risk. I also serve as the Project Director of the <a href="https://ccss.stjude.org/">Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS)</a>, and in that role, oversee the Coordinating Center located at St. Jude.</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you apply the skills you developed at DCEG in your current job?</strong></em><br />There are so many ways I can&rsquo;t even list them all! The rigorous epidemiology training I received at DCEG is an asset every single day, whether in my own research or through my work with the CCSS. Just as important, though, have been all the other skills I learned, such as leadership, effective collaboration, project management, time management, and communication skills. I&rsquo;m still working on all of these, of course, but the foundation I received in DCEG has allowed me to take on a job I couldn&rsquo;t imagine being able to perform otherwise.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any memories from your fellowship that you would like to share?</strong> </em><br />Many of my fondest memories are the relationships and just the casual interactions I had every day with other fellows, investigators and staff. Everyone was so supportive and generous with their time, and all these amazingly accomplished scientists treated me as a colleague, and not &ldquo;just a fellow&rdquo;. There was definitely a fair amount of stress, but there was a lot of fun, too&mdash;and that was because of all the great people at DCEG.</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you do in your free time?</strong></em><br />I have a daughter (7) and a son (9) who are very active, so we spend a lot of our time going back and forth to sporting events and school activities. Personally, I enjoy relaxing time with my family, and I still play in a soccer league once a week.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any advice for current or future DCEG fellows?</strong></em><br />I would say a DCEG fellowship offers an incredible and unique opportunity for growth, so try to identify areas where you have weaknesses, and then push out of your comfort zone to try new things. In addition to a much needed new listing on your CV, view each potential project as a chance to learn new skills, because that is what will really help you in the long run.</p>

<p>The Biostatistics Branches (BB) of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) seek qualified applicants for post-doctoral fellowships for statistical research on important analytic problems in cancer epidemiology and genetics. BB is an intramural research program in biostatistics in DCEG at NCI.</p>
<p>BB statisticians develop statistical research programs and actively collaborate both in cutting-edge studies of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental causes of cancer as well as in studies of cancer prevention, descriptive and clinical epidemiology. Statistical research is typically motivated by challenges encountered in DCEG studies, such as choosing an efficient study and sampling design, optimally combining data from multiple sources such as electronic medical records, genetic data bases, disease and bio-specimen registries, as well as designing validation studies and methods to evaluate and correct for measurement error in exposures and disease outcomes. The branch has active methodological research programs in areas that include: absolute risk prediction, the analysis of molecular data, environmental statistics, epidemiologic study design, the analysis of longitudinal and survival data, and cancer genetics. BB statistical investigators can and do conduct innovative methodological research in an environment of one-of-a-kind population-based epidemiologic and genetics studies.</p>
<p>We are seeking a postdoctoral candidate with a Ph.D. in statistics or biostatistics with solid statistical training and strong computer programming skills who is eligible to work in the US (US citizenship is not required). The position is for the development of new statistical methods and tools and will allow a recent Ph.D. to build his or her methodological and collaborative research program. The candidate is expected to participate in research team efforts, and lead several projects, leading to publications. Preference will be given to candidates interested in applied problems, and with superior methodological and communication skills. The stipend is commensurate with training and relevant research experience.</p>

<h2>Ewing Sarcoma Genome-wide Association Study</h2>
<p>Ewing sarcoma (EWS) is a pediatric bone tumor for which genetic risk factors remain poorly understood. DCEG investigators are studying inherited genetic variation to identify regions in the genome associated with increased risk of EWS by comparing the frequency of genotyped genetic variants between EWS cases and ancestry-matched, cancer-free controls to identify variants more frequently observed in EWS cases. This&nbsp;large (2,000+ cases), international consortium combines previously published data with new EWS cases to perform&nbsp;integrative analyses of newly discovered genetic susceptibility regions to identify local genomic structures and nearby target genes that may be important for EWS risk. The overall goal of the study is to expand our understanding of EWS etiology and provide insight into improved treatment and potentially preventative measures to reduce the overall burden of EWS.</p>

<p><strong>Years at DCEG:</strong> June 2005 to December 2007 <br /> <strong>DCEG title:</strong> Research Fellow <br /> <strong>Current organization:</strong> American Cancer Society (ACS)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /> <strong>Current title:</strong> Scientific Director, Epidemiology Research</p>
<p></p>
<p><em><strong>Who was your mentor at DCEG?</strong></em> <br /> <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=1004366&amp;sys_revision=7&amp;sys_variantid=1965&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_dependentvariantid="1965" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1004366" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7105184">Montserrat Garcia-Closas, M.D., Dr.P.H.</a>&ndash; the best mentor EVER.</p>
<p><em><strong>What did you work on (briefly)? </strong></em> <br /> I primarily analyzed genetic variation in individual genes and risk of breast and endometrial cancer. I also examined breast cancer risk factors by molecular subtypes.</p>
<p><em><strong>What is your current position?</strong></em> <br /> As scientific director for epidemiology research at the American Cancer Society, my position is equivalent to that of an associate professor in a department of epidemiology, but with less grant writing. Most of my day is spent generating new research ideas, overseeing statistical analyses, and writing manuscripts. I contribute to the collection of new exposure data through the development of follow-up questionnaires, and lead the collection of breast and ovarian tissue samples in the ACS&rsquo;s Cancer Prevention Study cohorts. I mentor students, fellows, and junior faculty at ACS and Emory University, and lecture occasionally at local universities. I also have the opportunity to share my research with the broader public by commenting to the media and advising my ACS colleagues working in communications and implementation.</p>
<p><em><strong>How do you apply the skills you developed at DCEG in your current job?</strong></em><br /> On a daily basis, I employ the skills developed during my fellowship; though I focus on the same areas, my research has grown and shifted over time.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any memories from your fellowship that you would like to share?</strong></em> <br />I have horrible memories of the vegetarian options at the cafeteria next to the old DCEG office*, but fond memories of tea times, branch celebrations, and office yoga!</p>
<p><em><strong>What do you do in your free time?</strong></em><br /> With two kids and a career, I don&rsquo;t have much free time. I relax when I can cook dinner in the evening with no interruptions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Do you have any advice for current or future DCEG fellows?</strong></em><br /> My friendships with fellows training concurrently with me will last a lifetime! Be sure to cultivate those relationships as they will become an important base to your network as you move beyond DCEG. Also, form collaborations with investigators outside of your comfort zone &ndash; expose yourself to their language and methods.</p>
<p><em>*Editor&rsquo;s note:</em> the NCI Shady Grove cafeteria has much better lunch options.</p>

<h3>May 2019</h3>
<h4>Privilege</h4>
<p>As we seek to create a more diverse and inclusive work environment, we have learned in a previous Inclusivity Minute to consider the role of &lsquo;in-group bias&rsquo;. A related and important concept is that of privilege. Privilege is defined as a special right, advantage, or immunity granted or available only to a particular person or group. Privilege affects who has access to career paths in science, the opportunities available when pursuing those paths, and interpersonal interactions at school and at work.</p>
<p>Privilege can apply to any specific individual or group. For example, white privilege allows people of fair skin to escape being stereotyped or harassed because of the color of their skin. Socio-economic privilege can provide a debt-free college education, or the opportunity to build generational wealth. A society free of oppression is one where all individuals experience equal privilege.</p>
<p>Acknowledging one&rsquo;s own privilege and making efforts to better understand the circumstances of those without it encourages an equitable work environment and society. Such an environment will help us to best achieve our collective scientific goals.</p>
<p>To learn more:<br />In the <strong>popular media</strong>, we suggest the Elite Daily article, &ldquo;<a href="https://www.elitedaily.com/life/privilege-benefiting-from-no-idea/1496370">5 Types of Privilege You Probably Have No Idea You're Benefiting From</a>&rdquo; and from the New Yorker &ldquo;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/books/page-turner/the-origins-of-privilege">The Origins of Privilege</a>&rdquo;.</p>
<p>For <strong>historical context</strong>, you can see W.E.B. Du Bois&rsquo; 1935 seminal work describing the concept of <a href="http://ouleft.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/blackreconstruction.pdf">psychological wage (large pdf, see p.700)</a>.</p>
<p>The University of Southern California offers a <a href="https://msw.usc.edu/mswusc-blog/diversity-workshop-guide-to-discussing-identity-power-and-privilege/#unpack">guided exercise on privilege</a>. Teaching Tolerance, a project of the Southern Poverty Law Center, also has a <a href="https://www.tolerance.org/magazine/fall-2018/toolkit-for-what-is-white-privilege-really">toolkit for educators</a> that includes useful resources.&nbsp;</p>
<h3>March 2019</h3>
<h4>Mental Health at Work</h4>
<p>An inclusive workplace values the contributions of all and accommodates the needs of diverse people, including people with mental illness. <br />&nbsp;<br />Every person who struggles with mental health has a right to work, should be treated equally without reproach or discrimination, and should be provided with support in the workplace. Access to evidence-based treatments works; however, attitudinal factors surrounding mental health play a role in restricting access to these treatments (see link below).<br />&nbsp;<br />We can do our part to reduce the stigmatization around mental disorders through willingness to talk openly with our colleagues and those we care about, and by taking time to reflect and consider the wellbeing of those around us.</p>

</div>
<p>According to Columbia University Professor Derald Wing Sue, microaggressions "are the everyday slights, indignities, put downs and insults that minorities experience in their day to day interactions with well-intentioned individuals who are unaware that they have engaged in an offensive act or made an offensive statement."</p>
<p>These comments are normally related to a person&rsquo;s race, gender, sexual orientation or disability status, and may seem like a compliment to the person speaking them, e.g., &ldquo;Your English is so good!&rdquo; In aggregate, comments like this contribute to a stressful and unpleasant environment for members of under-represented groups.</p>
<p>For examples of common microaggressions, or how to respond in different situations&mdash;when someone points out that you have made a microaggression, if you are the recipient of a microaggression, or when you witness a microaggression&mdash;here are some thoughtful articles:</p>

<p><strong>Make a New Year&rsquo;s resolution to contribute to a more diverse and inclusive workplace.</strong><br /><br />If you are one to make New Year&rsquo;s resolutions, consider when and how you will actively contribute to a more diverse and inclusive workplace. Resources provided through the Inclusivity Minute are designed to facilitate our shared learning and understanding of these values so we may all act as champions of diversity and inclusion at DCEG. Below are some definitions to get you started: <br /><br /><strong>Diversity</strong> is a term used to describe the range of human differences, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, age, social class, physical abilities or attributes, religious or ethical value systems, national origin or political beliefs. When we talk about diversity, we are talking about the composition of a group. In DCEG (as everywhere in the NIH), diversity is not ornamental, not a destination or goal. Rather, diversity is integral to our success as a research organization and part of our elemental nature. <br /><br /><strong>Inclusion</strong> refers to the involvement and empowerment of diverse people, where the inherent worth and dignity of all people is recognized. An inclusive organization promotes and sustains a sense of belonging for all, demonstrates values and practices respect for the talents, beliefs, backgrounds and ways of living of all its members. <br /><br />To learn more vocabulary, please visit the <a href="https://diversity.nih.gov/find-read-learn/glossary">NIH Office of Scientific Workforce Diversity Glossary</a>. <br /><br /><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=8&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1129000" sys_contentid="1129000" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7327553" sys_siteid="475" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1129000" sys_dependentvariantid="1418">Read the Frequently Asked Questions about the Inclusivity Minute email project</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Imposter phenomenon&nbsp;</strong>is the persistent feeling that one&rsquo;s success is due to luck or chance, rather than competence, despite evidence to the contrary. The phenomenon has been observed in individuals at all career levels; it is more common among women, minorities, in interdisciplinary settings, and among people in the midst of a job transition.</p>
<p>Imposter phenomenon can manifest in several ways. Self-doubt can result in procrastination, risk aversion and avoidance (for career advancement, job applications, etc.), or compromising health and work-life balance. People suffering from the imposter phenomenon are unlikely to talk about their experience with others. While you may not have heard of it, it may be occurring to someone around you.</p>
<p>If you are feeling like an imposter, have an open discussion about it with trusted mentors and peers.</p>
<p>As a mentor, you can help your mentees by attributing their successes to internal factors and by acknowledging failure as a common and necessary step for learning and growth.</p>

<p><strong>Have you heard of in-groups?</strong> An in-group is a group of people who identify with each other based on factors including gender, race, religion, or nationality/geography.</p>
<p>In-group bias has an evolutionary basis: Humans evolved to be more empathetic toward in-group members, making it an unconscious bias. In-group favoritism does not necessarily imply negative behavior toward out-group members. It may manifest as disproportionate kindness and generosity to in-group members, causing out-group members to experience the negative effects of that preference.</p>
<p>In the workplace, in-group bias can affect hiring, award nomination, committee membership, and peer review processes, among others. Being aware of in-groups allows you to make thoughtful, conscious decisions to overcome automatic, potentially unfair decisions and/or actions.</p>

<p>The DCEG Fellows Committee and I are joining forces in a learning initiative to increase our awareness of issues related to diversity, inclusion and equity. We are launching a monthly&nbsp;<strong>Inclusivity Minute&nbsp;</strong>email, which will address relevant topics and provide resources for learning more. I will send the first installment next month.</p>
<p>This project was inspired by findings from the 2018 DCEG Fellows Survey which revealed that 13% of fellows have been made to feel uncomfortable or witnessed others being made to feel uncomfortable in our workplace because of their gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion or other personal qualities. We aspire to a DCEG culture in which everyone feels comfortable, welcome and valued.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am confident we are all equally committed to building and sustaining a positive environment for all; we hope that you will take advantage of this initiative to learn together.</p>

<p><strong>A mutation-based score test for identify driver genes and subtype heterogeneity of driver genes in cancer genome sequencing studies</strong></p>
<h3>Description</h3>
<p>Identifying driver genes that drive cancer initiation and progression is essential for understanding mechanisms of carcinogenesis and designing therapeutic strategies. While cancer genomes are heterogeneous across patients, no method has been developed to investigate whether the sets of driver gene are distinct across cancer subtypes. We developed a statistical framework MutScot that utilizes patient information to investigate subtype heterogeneity of driver genes.</p>

<li><b>Binary exposure and binary confounder</b>: a) find the adjusted RR given the observed RR, P(C=1|X=1) and P(C=1|X=0) [or equivalently the observed RR, P(C=1|X=0) and the odds ratio OR(X,C)]; and b) solve for the necessary OR(X,C) given the observed, adjusted and confounder RRs and P(C=1|X=0);</li>
<li><b>Categorical exposure and categorical confounder</b>: find the adjusted RRs for each level of exposure given the observed RRs, the confounder distribution at each level of exposure P(C|X) and confounder RRs at the reference level of exposure;</li>
<li><b>Categorical exposure and binary confounder</b>: solve for the conditional distribution of the confounder at each level of X, P(C=1|X), given the observed, adjusted and confounder RRs and P(C=1|X=0);</li>
<li><b>Categorical exposure and catgorical confounder</b>: solve for the confounder RRs given the observed RRs, the adjusted RRs and P(C|X).</li>

<h3>What is the goal of this initiative?</h3>
The Inclusivity Minute Email Project is an initiative of the OD and the DCEG Fellows Committee, composed of representatives from each branch. The goal is to introduce DCEG staff to topics related to diversity and inclusion that they might not already be familiar with and to provide resources to learn more.
<p>We all come to DCEG with different backgrounds and experience. The Inclusivity Minute aims to spark conversation and inquiry.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong>Why an email?</h3>
In 2017, the NCI offered a staff training on the topic of Unconscious Bias which was attended by many across the Division. Afterwards, the DCEG Fellows Committee received some feedback that those who might benefit most from the training had not attended, a phenomenon that has been observed elsewhere (Kulik et al. <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/job.444">The rich get richer: predicting participation in voluntary diversity training.</a>&nbsp;<span><em>J Organiz Behav</em></span>).<span>&nbsp;</span>
<p></p>
<p>In 2018, the DCEG Fellows Survey revealed that 13% of fellows have been made to feel uncomfortable or witnessed others being made to feel uncomfortable in our workplace because of their gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, race, religion or other personal qualities.</p>
<p>Spurred by these findings, the Fellows Committee proposed a short, DCEG-specific email to both complement the Unconscious Bias training and reach a broader audience.</p>
<h3>How are the topics selected?</h3>
Members of the DCEG Fellows Committee have brainstormed an initial list of topics, and they hope to continue adding to this list with your help. They select a topic for the following month&rsquo;s email message during monthly meetings. They try to prioritize topics that are new and may not otherwise be covered by NIH and NCI-wide emails.
<h3></h3>
<h3>What is the writing/review process?</h3>
So far, authors have been volunteers from the DCEG Fellows Committee. The writing responsibilities are rotated among members of the committee. Each Inclusivity Minute is first reviewed by the DCEG Fellows Committee, and then by staff in the DCEG Office of Education and the Communications team.
<p>If you would like to be an author or to participate in the review process, please reach out to <a href="mailto:Jackie.lavigne@nih.gov">Jackie Lavigne</a> in the&nbsp;Office of Education or <a href="mailto:diana.withrow@nih.gov">Diana Withrow</a> on the DCEG Fellows Committee.</p>
<h3><strong> </strong><strong>Where can I go for more resources?</strong></h3>
Resources on each specific topic are provided in the emails. In general, more information on issues of diversity and inclusion can be found at the <span><a href="https://www.edi.nih.gov/consulting/outreach/who-call/NCI">NIH Office of Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion</a></span>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></div>]]></content>

<p>On October 11 and 12, 2018, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) convened a group of experts to discuss the current state of the science of mutational signatures in cancer research and related opportunities and challenges. The goals of the meeting were to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify major issues and future directions in the characterization of mutational signatures that could lead to new insights into etiology, outcomes, and risk factors for specific cancers.</li>
<li>Encourage discussion to inform NCI priorities and frame critical research questions.</li>
<li>Develop new collaborations to advance research on mutational signatures and their application in clinical practice.</li>
</ul>
<p>Next steps to be considered by the NCI include the following:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>Increase integration with the field of cancer biology, including developing larger data sets and collaborations with basic scientists. NCI is developing an organoid library that might be useful to test exposures to different chemicals following exposure over time.<span> </span></li>
<li>Evaluate current algorithms used to benchmark mutational signatures in coordinated competition open to entire community.</li>
<li>Determine the relative importance of coverage of the cancer genome (targeted vs. whole genome) for signature discovery and assessment, especially in clinical settings. Pursue the question of how deep coverage should be through a separate NCI-supported competition.</li>
<li>Determine how to assess and use Formalin-Fixed Paraffin-Embedded (FFPE) tissue samples.</li>
<li>Increase the depth of understanding of somatic signatures through integration with the genomic landscape, examining mistakes/mis-repairs and the role of germline mutations.</li>
<li>Determine the degree of precision for detecting signatures with respect to exposure/prognosis, beginning with known carcinogens.</li>
<li>Investigate the possible importance of tumor signatures by disparities, especially geographic and environmental differences as well as migration differentials.</li>
<li>Develop consensus on use of clinical signatures.</li>
<li>Support studies to address reverse assessments to identify promising therapies or germline/environmental triggers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Over the last three decades, advances in treatment and supportive care have translated into steady improvements in survival after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) given for patients with leukemia and other malignant and nonmalignant diseases. With larger numbers of transplant recipients surviving long term, concern has turned to quantifying the late effects of this treatment, particularly total-body irradiation and long-term immunosuppression. Investigators in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch have an extensive history of collaborating with the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplantation to evaluate risk factors for new solid malignancies and post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorders among allogeneic HSCT recipients. Studies focus on specific outcomes, such as melanoma.</p>

<p>The last several decades have seen dramatic improvements in cancer survival, mainly due to advances in treatment and the increased detection of cancer at an early stage. With more than 16 million cancer survivors in the U.S. alone, concern has turned to potential late effects, particularly the development of a new malignancy. To identify groups of cancer survivors that are at increased risk for multiple primary cancers, Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) investigators&nbsp;have been leading&nbsp;a series of studies using registry data to monitor second cancer risks in a range of survivor populations.</p>
<p>The foundation of the research is a comprehensive population-based analysis of the risk of subsequent cancer in the U.S. [See <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/archive/publications/mpmono/index.html">New Malignancies Among Cancer Survivors: SEER Cancer Registries, 1973-2000</a> (Curtis RE, Freedman DM, Ron E, Ries LAG, Hacker D, Edwards B, Tucker P, Fraumeni JF, Jr., eds.) National Cancer Institute. NIH Publication No. 05-5302. Bethesda, MD, 2006 (available at <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/publications/mpmono/index.html">SEER Monograph</a>)]. The 500-page monograph utilized data from nine cancer registries participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from 1973 to 2000. The monograph describes the patterns of subsequent cancer risk for over 50 adult first primary cancers and 19 types of childhood cancers, by gender, age at initial diagnosis, time since diagnosis, initial treatment by radiation, and histologic type. Each chapter focuses on a specific initial cancer, presents the risk of subsequent cancers, and discusses potential causal mechanisms.</p>
<p>Additional studies have quantified contralateral breast cancer risk, breast cancer after Hodgkin lymphoma, melanoma after non-Hodgkin lymphoma, sarcoma risk after young adulthood cancers, and leukemia risk after chemotherapy for solid tumors and lymphoid malignancies among adult and childhood cancer survivors. The data from the monograph and these studies provide a resource that will be useful to clinicians, researchers, policy makers, and cancer survivors, especially in tailoring appropriate guidelines and strategies for prevention and early detection of new malignancies.</p>

<p>Dry cleaning industry workers are exposed to tetrachloroethylene and other chlorinated solvents that are possibly carcinogenic to humans. In order to investigate the cancer mortality patterns associated with employment and exposures in the dry cleaning industry, NCI investigators conducted a retrospective cohort study of 5,369 workers who were members of a dry cleaning union in St Louis, Missouri between 1948 and 1978 for at least one year.</p>
<p>In a recently completed 22-year follow-up of the cohort, workers experiencing high solvent exposures were at increased risk of death from cancers of the bladder and kidney, hematologic malignancies, and heart disease.</p>

<p>Agricultural exposures including pesticides, endotoxins, and diesel exhaust have been associated with risk of various cancers, although the biological mechanisms underlying these associations are generally not well understood. To address this gap, DCEG investigators initiated the Biomarkers of Exposure and Effect in Agriculture (BEEA) study within the Agricultural Health Study, a cohort that includes pesticide applicators in Iowa and North Carolina.&nbsp;Within BEEA,&nbsp;they collected biospecimens (blood, urine, buccal cells, and house dust) and updated information about pesticide use and other agricultural exposures from over 1,600 farmers/pesticide applicators.</p>
<p>The BEEA study biorepository will be a resource for future cross-sectional molecular epidemiologic investigations to elucidate the biological mechanisms underlying associations between agricultural exposures and risk of cancer and other chronic diseases. For example, within BEEA investigators are studying&nbsp;agricultural exposures that might influence the risk of multiple myeloma and its precursor, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance, which was previously shown to be in excess in the Agricultural Health Study.</p>

<p>Sherlock-<em>lung</em> is a comprehensive study that aims to trace lung cancer etiology in never smokers by analyzing genomic data in tumor and surrounding lung tissue. Whole genome sequencing, whole transcriptome, and genome-wide methylation data will be analyzed to identify exogenous and endogenous processes involved in lung tumorigenesis. Analysis of the tumor microenvironment, clonal evolution, and circulating tumor DNA will be conducted in a subgroup of the cases. The molecular landscape will be integrated with histological and radiological features in order to develop a more refined classification of lung cancer in never smokers and provide insights into prognosis and treatment strategies.</p>
<p>Sherlock-<em>lung</em> will include 2,500 never smoker lung cancer patients, a subset (n=~500) with &ldquo;special exposures,&rdquo; such as coal, radon, asbestos, air pollution, and microbial infection. The remaining ~2000 cases will come from the &ldquo;general population,&rdquo; with unknown exposures to lung cancer risk factors.</p>

<p>Benzene is a widely distributed environmental contaminant known to cause acute myeloid leukemia, aplastic anemia, and perhaps other hematopoietic neoplasms, related hematopoietic disorders, and possibly other cancers. In a binational, multidisciplinary effort, investigators from NCI and the Chinese Centers for Disease Control have conducted a follow-up investigation during 1972-87 of approximately 75,000 Chinese benzene-exposed workers and 35,000 unexposed workers from more than 700 factories in 12 cities.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators from the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=53&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302610" sys_contentid="302610" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1422" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7270544" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302610" rxinlineslot="103">Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch</a>, the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=110&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302459" sys_contentid="302459" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1422" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7270545" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302459" rxinlineslot="103">Radiation Epidemiology Branch</a>, the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=41&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302568" sys_contentid="302568" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1422" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7270546" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302568" rxinlineslot="103">Biostatistics Branch</a> and the Chinese collaborators found that workers exposed to benzene were at significantly higher risk of developing acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Risk varied by temporal patterns of exposure with recent exposure mostly strongly linked with acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, whereas distant exposure was more strongly associated with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In parallel cross-sectional investigations carried out in Shanghai during 1992 and Tianjin during 2001, NCI and CDC collaborators have made steady progress in elucidating the mechanisms of benzene-induced carcinogenesis, biomarkers of benzene&rsquo;s early effects, and identifying genetic markers of susceptibility. Currently, a case-cohort study is in progress that extends the follow-up through 1999 and will quantify benzene-related dose-response in relation to hematopoietic malignancies and related disorders, benzene hematotoxicity, and lung cancer. Molecular and genetic studies are underway to assess potential genetic susceptibility in relation to development of benzene hematotoxicity.</p>

<h3>Leukemia Risk in Chernobyl Clean-up Workers</h3>

<p>Following the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, hundreds of thousands of clean-up workers were exposed primarily to external radiation with those sent earliest receiving the highest doses. (140 mGy in 1986, 90 mGy in 1987 and 40 mGy in 1988-89). Studies of cancer among clean-up workers have focused on leukemia. Investigators in DCEG have conducted a case-control study of leukemia and other hematological diseases based on a large cohort of male clean-up workers from Ukraine (~110,000). Individual doses to the bone marrow were estimated using a new method developed for this study. In part because of the intriguing findings, the study has been extended to accrue cases for an additional five years.</p>

<h3>Leukemia Risk in Baltic Clean-up Workers</h3>

<p>In a separate study of cancer incidence among Chernobyl clean-up workers from Estonia and Latvia, DCEG investigators did not observe a significantly elevated risk of leukemia. Thyroid cancer was increased, but this appeared to be due largely to screening.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators are leading a multi-center international study of second primary gastrointestinal (GI) cancers among survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the testis, breast, and cervix. This is the first study to comprehensively investigate the radiation dose-response for upper GI cancers following fractionated, higher dose radiation exposures. It is also one of the few studies to investigate the risk of secondary, non-hematologic malignancies following treatment with&nbsp;chemotherapy.&nbsp;The primary aim of the study is to provide new information on the relation between radiation dose and cancer risk for three GI organs (stomach, esophagus, and pancreas), for which few quantitative data exist.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Four international population-based cohorts including over 900,000 1-year survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma and cancers of the testis, breast, and cervix were assembled. Analyses of these cohorts have newly quantified the age and temporal patterns of risk for subsequent cancer and non-cancer outcomes, and highlighted that many of the excess risks often persist for over 25 years following the first cancer diagnosis.</p>
<ul>
<li>Survivors of testicular cancer were demonstrated to have increased risk of mortality from infections, digestive diseases, and circulatory diseases when compared with the general population;</li>
<li>Survivors of both breast and cervical cancer experienced excess risks of subsequent cancer at least 25 years after diagnosis, particularly for women diagnosed at young ages;</li>
<li>In addition, breast cancer survivors had a higher risk of suicide than women in the general population;</li>
<li>Risk of solid cancers following Hodgkin lymphoma was&nbsp;strongly related to both young age at diagnosis and attained age, but did not appear to have changed over calendar time. In contrast, risk of acute myeloid leukemia following Hodgkin lymphoma decreased over time, likely due to changes in chemotherapy.</li>
</ul>
<p>Given the extensive nature of data collection required for a detailed evaluation of dose response relations for radiotherapy and chemotherapy, a nested-case control design was chosen to address this aim, resulting in a total of seven case-control studies. Analyses have demonstrated linear increase in risk associated with increasing radiation dose for stomach, pancreas, and esophagus cancers after Hodgkin lymphoma; stomach and pancreas cancers after testis cancer; esophagus cancer after breast cancer; and stomach cancer after cervical cancer.</p>

<p>The CARE Model is a SAS macro that allows researchers to estimate an African American woman's risk of developing invasive breast cancer. The CARE Model may be updated periodically as new data or research becomes available.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Users can enter data on risk factors and projection interval ages for a group of women, and the macro will return the corresponding absolute risk projections. This program may be useful for researchers who need risk projections for an entire study population.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov/">NCI Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool</a> has been updated to include the CARE Model information. Both the tool and SAS macro are designed for use by health professionals and researchers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you are not a health professional, you are encouraged to discuss the results and your personal risk of breast cancer with your healthcare provider.</p>

<p>Between 1945 and 1980, the U.S., the U.S.S.R., the U.K., France and China carried out more than 500 atmospheric tests of nuclear weapons totaling the explosive equivalent of 440 megatons of TNT. These tests injected radioactive material into the atmosphere, much of which became widely dispersed before being deposited as fallout. Cancer investigators have been studying the health effects of radiation for decades, including radioactive fallout, making radiation one of the best-understood agents of environmental injury. The legacy of open-air nuclear weapons testing includes a small but significant increase in thyroid cancer, leukemia, and certain solid tumors.</p>
<p>The NCI developed an <a href="https://radiationcalculators.cancer.gov/fallout">online calculator to estimate the radiation dose received by the thyroid gland from radionuclides in fallout from nuclear tests</a>. The early version of this tool estimated exposure and risk from fallout from the Nevada Test Site (NTS). In 2017, investigators released a new version of the tool that includes exposures from sites outside of the United States (global fallout). <a href="https://radiationcalculators.cancer.gov/fallout/update/">Read more about this and additional enhancements.</a></p>
<p>The calculator estimates an individual&rsquo;s risk of developing thyroid cancer from their exposure and provides an estimate of probability of causation, sometimes called assigned share (PC/AS) for individuals who have been diagnosed with thyroid cancer.</p>

<p>Esophageal and gastric cancers together cause over 1,000,000 deaths each year. Because these upper gastrointestinal (UGI) cancers have very poor prognoses, discovering etiologic agents and improving methods of early detection for these cancers are of prime importance.</p>
<p>The overriding goal of the DCEG UGI Cancer Research Group is to foster the exchange of ideas and expertise on UGI cancers among investigators from DCEG, NCI, and the extramural community. Additionally, this exchange of ideas and expertise will enhance use of our existing research resources and more thoughtful conceptualization and execution of future research. This working group also serves as a magnet for the recruitment and training of junior investigators interested in UGI cancer research.</p>
<h2>Objectives</h2>
<ol>
<li>Promote the exchange of ideas and expertise on UGI cancers within DCEG and among other NCI and extramural researchers in the field</li>
<li>Discuss research priorities in UGI cancer research</li>
<li>Organize, coordinate, and optimize the use of UGI cancer research resources in DCEG</li>
<li>Identify and explore unique opportunities afforded by DCEG resources (e.g., large sample sizes for UGI cancers to study rare exposures and gene-environment interactions)</li>
<li>Recruit outstanding junior investigators and fellows to conduct research in UGI cancer</li>
</ol>

<p>Dr. Cahoon also investigates whether ionizing radiation in environmentally exposed populations is related to several outcomes that have been little studied (e.g., precancers, histological subtypes) and whether radiation-related risks are modified by factors for which there are limited data (e.g., age at exposure). Part of this effort involves the assessment of radiation-related risk for various cancers in the Lifespan Study of Japanese atomic bomb survivors. Through a collaboration with the National Research Centre for Radiation Medicine in Ukraine, she is also leading a thyroid cancer case-control study nested in a cohort of emergency clean-up workers who were exposed to a wide range of external radiation doses at the Chernobyl nuclear plant.</p>
<p>Dr. Cahoon received her B.S.E. in bioengineering from the University of Pennsylvania, S.M. from the Engineering Systems Division at MIT, and M.H.S. in biostatistics and Ph.D. in environmental epidemiology from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

<p>Introduction<br />IRAP is an interactive computer program which calculates both point estimates and confidence intervals for attributable risk, based on regression models. Modeling consists of three conceptual phases: creating a library of variables, defining the model, and running the model.</p>
<p>IRAP keeps a "library" of variables which the user has defined. A variable can take its value directly from the data file, or it can be defined in terms of other variables in the library. Typically, the user will create a separate library for each data file that he or she uses. A library can be saved to disk, then loaded whenever the corresponding data file is used.</p>
<p>Once a library of variables has been created (or loaded from disk), the user may define a model. IRAP supports six data sampling methods:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Simple Random Sampling</li>
<li>Stratified Random Sampling</li>
<li>Frequency Matching</li>
<li>Individual Matching</li>
<li>Cohort Analysis</li>
<li>Cross-Sectional Analysis</li>

<p>After choosing the appropriate sampling method, the user defines a model by specifying the appropriate variable names. A model can contain both discrete and continuous variables. IRAP correctly parameterizes the discrete variables, so the user need not explicitly create "dummy variables."</p>
<p>Once the model has been specified, the user tells IRAP to fit the model. The program asks for the names of the input and output files. It then reads the data, and fits the model.</p>
<p>While these three phases are conceptually distinct, they can be interleaved. For example, after fitting a model, the user may decide to combine two levels of exposure into one. It is easy to define a new variable, then rerun the model, substituting the new exposure variable for the old.</p>

<p>; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />; DataFiles<br />; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />[<br />[&gt;&gt;]</p>
<p>Data Files<br />The data files used by IRAP are very simple: they are standard text files (i.e., "ASCII" or "flat" files, not word processor files), with one line per record. The lines are "column-delimited." That is, a variable is defined by the value occupying a given range of columns in the file. Each line is considered a separate record. Leading and trailing blanks are allowed. Thus, a small data file such as</p>
<p>00<br />100<br />101<br />&nbsp;</p>
<p>contains three records. Assuming that each variable in this particular file occupies exactly one column, it contains separate variables. The variable in column 1 would be missing for the first record.</p>
<p>Records do not need to be sorted, and they may contain missing data. If a record contains a missing value for a variable which is actually used in the model, then it will not be used for fitting the model. In the above example, a model which uses the variable in column 1 would only use two records; models which do not use that variable will use all three. A "missing value" is anything that cannot be interpreted as a number, for example, a blank field or a letter. A field may contain leading and trailing blanks, so long as it has a real value in it somewhere. There is no upper limit on the length of a record. Most types of model require individual data. The exception is the cohort model, which takes data in the form of a person-year table.</p>

<p>; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />; Variables<br />; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />[<br />[&gt;&gt;]</p>
<p>Variables<br />Although the data file is laid out in columns, IRAP's models are defined in terms of named variables. IRAP maintains a list of variables that may be used in the model, called the "library." Variables can be added to or deleted from the library, and the entire library may be saved to disk for future reference. Typically, an entire file specification will be saved as a library. Then, that library will be loaded at the beginning of a session, and used to define models.</p>
<p>There are two types of variable: the "file variable" and the "defined variable." A file variable takes its values directly from the data file; a defined variable is a function of any number of file variables. Each variable has three attributes: its name, its number (that is, its position in the library), and optionally, a "missing code." In addition, file variables must include a starting column and field length, and may also specify an implicit decimal point's position. Defined variables replace these attributes with a definition.</p>
<p>IRAP's variable names are much like those in many programming and statistical languages. They may consist of letters, numbers, and underscores ('_'), but may not begin with a number. Variable names are "case insensitive." That is, uppercase and lowercase letters are interchangeable. Although IRAP variable names can use mixed case for readability (for example, "Age" or "GroupedWeight"), case alone does not distinguish two different variables (for example, "AGE" and "age" both refer to the same variable). In certain contexts, a variable can be specified either by name or by number. However, the number is merely the variable's current position in the library: if a variable is added or removed, then the numbers of all the variables after it will be shifted.</p>
<p>Both file variables and defined variables can have a "missing code." This is a value which, when encountered, is converted to an internal "missing" value, as if the field in the data file were blank. Consider a variable called "AGE," with values 0, 1, 2, and 3. Many files may contain a "9" for subjects whose age is unknown. Declaring 9 to be the "missing code" for AGE will cause those subjects to be excluded from any analysis involving the AGE variable. The function of a missing code in defined variables is a bit more subtle. As would be expected, a defined variable is automatically considered missing if it depends on any missing variables. Using the "AGE" variable as above, the defined variable</p>
<p>AGEp1 = AGE + 1</p>
<p>will assume the values 1, 2, 3, and 4. No missing code is needed for AGEp1, because AGE's missing status (whether due to a blank or a "9" in the data file) is propagated through the definition.</p>
<p>Although IRAP only allows one missing code per variable, a defined variable with a missing code can be used to account for several different missing codes in the file. Consider the file variable RACE:</p>
<table class="blue-table" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">Race</th>
<th scope="col">Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>1</td>
<td>white</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>black</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>other</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>refused to answer</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>5</td>
<td>misc. unknown</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>For most analyses, both 4 and 5 should be considered "missing," but IRAP only allows one missing code. A workaround is to define RACE_1, with missing code 4, as follows:</p>
<p>RACE_1 = RACE * (RACE &lt;_3d_&gt;&lt;/_3d_&gt;<br />+ 4 * (RACE &gt; 3)</p>
<p>When RACE is 1, 2, or 3, the expression will be evaluated as</p>
<p>RACE_1 = RACE * (1) + 4 * (0)<br />= RACE</p>
<p>but when RACE is 4 or 5,</p>
<p>RACE_1 = RACE * (0) + 4 * (1)<br />= 4</p>
<p>which is its missing code. There is nothing magic about which number is used as the missing code--it must only be outside of the variable's normal range. In the above example, 5, 6, -1 or 99 could just as easily have been used as a missing code (with the corresponding change in the definition).</p>

<p>File Variables<br />IRAP's data files are column-delimited: file variables are specified in terms of starting column and field length. Often, the decimal point is omitted from column-delimited data; because it occurs in the same place in all records, its position can be inferred. This situation is handled by the "precision" attribute of file variables. A variable with two implied decimal places (e.g., 1.23 represented as "123") has a precision of 2. An explicit decimal in the data will override the implied decimal, so "12." will always be interpreted as 12, not as 0.12 or 1.2.</p>
<p>Please note that leading and trailing spaces can present some odd results if values are not lined up consistently in their fields. Consider the file:</p>
<p>81009<br />81019<br />8 209<br />820 9</p>
<p>The variable "a" starts at column 2, has length 3, and precision 2. Leading and trailing blanks are ignored, so the records are interpreted as follows:</p>
<table class="blue-table" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">data</th>
<th scope="col">a</th>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>100</td>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>20</td>
<td>0.20</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>20</td>
<td>0.20</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
This situation occurs rarely, if ever, because data represented with implicit decimal places are usually right-justified in the field.

<p>Defined Variables<br />Like its naming rules, IRAP's variable definition language borrows from more general languages. It combines arithmetic and boolean operators, assigning precedence levels which naturally group expressions as would normally be expected. Parentheses may be used to override the default operator precedence, or simply for clarity. The operators are as follows, in order of descending precedence:</p>
<table class="blue-table" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>( )</td>
<td>grouping</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>- (unary minus)<br />* /<br />+ -</td>
<td>arithmetic</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;_3d_&gt; &gt;= == !=<br />&amp;&amp;<br />||&lt;/_3d_&gt;</td>
<td>boolean</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>@saturate(...)</td>
<td>combination</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first line of boolean operators contains the relational operators, "less than" (&lt;_29_2c_ _22_less="" or="" _equal22_=""&gt;&lt;/_29_2c_&gt;&lt;_3d_29_2c_ _22_greater="" _than22_="" _28_=""&gt;), "greater or equal" (&gt;=), "equals" (==), and "not equal" (!=). Below them are the "and" (&amp;&amp;) and "or" (||) operators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As IRAP only handles real numbers, the boolean operators bear some explanation Any boolean expression will evaluate to 1 if true, or 0 if false. The operands of a boolean operator may have any value; zero is interpreted as false, nonzero as true. Thus,</p>
<table class="blue-table" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">expression</th>
<th scope="col">result</th>

<tr>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>The operators may be mixed freely, with the exception of the "@saturate()" operator, which may not be part of a larger expression. This operator creates a "saturation variable," which is a variable with a unique value for each observed combination of its operands' values. The syntax is:</p>
<p>@saturate(var1, var2, ...)</p>
<p>One or more variables may be listed, separated by commas. Given variables var1 (1..2) and var2 (0..1), a saturation variable will have the following values:</p>
<table class="blue-table" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">@saturate(var1, var2)</th>
<th scope="col">var1</th>
<th scope="col">var2</th>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>

</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>2</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
Note that the baseline level of the saturation variable represents the lowest observed value of all the component variables. The saturation operator is offered primarily as a convenient way to create saturated models. The above example could be modeled with three effects: var1, var2, and an interaction term. However, in models with more variables, it becomes more convenient to define a saturation variable than to explicitly model many interaction terms. Another use for the saturation operator involves the trivial case, "@saturate(var1)". No matter what values var1 assumes, the operator will map them to integers (0, 1, ...). This matter will be discussed more in the next section.

<p>Models<br />IRAP supports six data sampling methods, based on three types of regression model. Simple and stratified random sampling, frequency matched, and cross-sectional data fit a logistic model; individual-matched data fits a conditional logistic model; and cohort data fits a Poisson model. All models except for the conditional logistic model may be fit either with or without an intercept parameter, and stratified models may include or exclude parameters representing the stratification variables.</p>

<p>; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />; Parameters<br />; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />[<br />[&gt;&gt;]</p>
<p>Parameterization<br />The model makes a syntactic distinction between discrete and continuous variables. A discrete variable with n levels is automatically modeled as n-1 0/1 parameters, using the variable's minimum value as the baseline. A continuous variable, marked by a "#" in the model definition, is modeled as a single parameter, whose values reflect the data literally. Continuous variables are assumed to have a baseline value of 0.</p>
<p>Discrete variables are assumed to take on consecutive integer values; fractions are rounded down. While this rule causes no problems in most cases, variables that have non-integer values, or whose values are not consecutive integers, cause problems. Consider the variable "fat," which has the following values:</p>
<table class="blue-table" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">fat</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>4.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
If fat really is a discrete variable, then it should be modeled with four parameters: "fat=2," "fat=4.1," "fat=4.2," and "fat=4.3." However, IRAP rounds the highest three values to 4, so it is interpreted as follows:
<table class="blue-table" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">fat</th>
<th scope="col">IRAP interpretation</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>2</td>
<td>2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.1</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>4.2</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.3</td>
<td>4</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Now, seeing that "fat" has a minimum value of 1, and a maximum value of 4, IRAP creates three model parameters: "fat=2," "fat=3," and "fat=4." Thus, the model would look something like this:</p>
<p>Parameters</p>
<table class="blue-table" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">fat</th>
<th scope="col">fat=2</th>
<th scope="col">fat=3</th>
<th scope="col">fat=4</th>

<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4.3</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Three levels of the variable have been collapsed into the "fat=4" parameter, while the "fat=3" parameter has no use at all.</p>
<p>The solution to this problem is to define a new variable as "satfat = @saturate(fat)." The new variable will be defined as follows:</p>
<table class="blue-table" cellspacing="0">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th scope="col">satfat</th>
<th scope="col">fat</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>0</td>
<td>1</td>

<td>4.1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>3</td>
<td>4.2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td>4.3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
This variable will be modeled correctly, contributing four meaningful parameters to the model:

<p>IRAP automates the modeling of interactions in much the same way as with main effects. An interaction is expressed as the product of two or more variables, such as:</p>
<p>sex * age</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>sex * age * race.</p>
<p>An interaction can contain any combination of discrete and continuous terms. Continuous variables are marked with a number sign:</p>
<p>sex * #ContAge.</p>
<p>Discrete terms are parameterized automatically. An interaction of discrete variables results in one model parameter representing each combination of non-baseline levels of the component variables. Thus, an interaction of any number of binary variables will result in a single model parameter, which is 1 when all of the interaction terms are "exposed." Consider the following examples:</p>

<p>; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />; Effects<br />; ---------------------------------------------------------------------------<br />[<br />[&gt;&gt;]</p>
<p>Effects<br />The variables that contribute to a model are grouped by function into lists of "effects." Some lists are common to all models, while others, such as "case indicator," are specific to certain types of model. Similarly, some lists may contain many variables, while others are limited to one. The following types of model effect occur in all models:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Exposures - Each model must have one or more exposure variables. These are the variables used to determine exposure level in calculating attributable risk.</li>
<li>Confounders - Optional. These variables do not contribute to the attributable risk, but are modeled in the regression.</li>
<li>By-variables - Optional. Separate analyses are performed for each combination of values for these variables.</li>
<li>Interactions - Optional. This is a special type of effect that allows interactions to be modeled without resorting to huge lists of defined variables. An interaction can contain any combination of discrete and continuous variables, and as with main effects, discrete variables are automatically parameterized. To correctly calculate attributable risk, IRAP automatically treats any interactions involving an exposure variable as exposures as well.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>In addition to these effects, each type of model also has other, required, effects, as listed below.</p>
<p>Simple Random Sampling, Cross-sectional:</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Case indicator - A model must have exactly one case indicator. This variable must be a file variable. 0 represents a control; other (non-missing) values indicate a case.</li>
</ul>
</div>
Stratified Random Sampling, Frequency Matching:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Case indicator - A model must have exactly one case indicator. This variable must be a file variable. 0 represents a control; other (non-missing) values indicate a case.</li>
<li>Stratifiers - The model may be stratified by one or more discrete variables. The "Stratifiers Modeled" checkbox indicates whether these will also be included as covariates in the regression, or merely used for stratifying the attributable risk.</li>
</ul>
</div>
1:Ki Individual Matching:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Case indicator - A model must have exactly one case indicator. This variable must be a file variable. 0 represents a control; other (non-missing) values indicate a case.</li>
<li>Set number - This variable tells which matched set each individual belongs to. The specific values are arbitrary, but must be the same for each member of a given matched set.</li>
</ul>
</div>
Cohort Analysis:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Event count - The number of events that occured in the specific cell.</li>
<li>Person-years - The number of person-years in the specific cell.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>All types of model except for "1:Ki individual matching" allow an "Include Intercept" option. By default, an intercept parameter will be included in the regression model. However, you may choose instead to use one of the model's discrete variables to span the intercept. In this case, the baseline level of one variable will also be represented by a parameter in the model. This variable is chosen automatically. The first discrete confounder, if it exists, is used. Otherwise, the first discrete exposure variable is used. However, the baseline parameter never contributes to the attributable risk estimate.</p>
<p>A similar option exists for modeling stratifiers. By default, stratifier variables are modeled as discrete covariates. If you disable this option, they will not be modeled, but will still define the strata in the attributable risk analysis.</p>

<p>Convergence Criteria<br />The final set of modeling options offered by IRAP adjusts how the model is fit, not the model's contents per se. IRAP allows you to tune three parameters: maximum iterations, convergence tolerance, and singularity threshold. The maximum iterations parameter (default, 30) adjusts how long the regression is allowed to run before the model is deemed divergent. The convergence tolerance (default, 1x10**-8) is used to test for convergence in the regression. The singularity threshold (default, 1x10**-12) tests for information matrix singularity. While these defaults are usually adequate, you may change them to suit individual needs and tastes. They are saved as part of the program configuration, so your settings will be restored every time you start the program.</p>

<p>DOS<br />When fitting several models at once, it is often convenient to check a report, or copy a data file without exiting IRAP. For this reason, IRAP offers a DOS "shell" facility. By choosing this command, you will start a command prompt while IRAP is still running. From this prompt, you can do routine chores without having to leave IRAP. Because IRAP is still running behind the shell, less memory than normal will be available, but most programs will not be hindered by this condition.</p>
<p>To return to IRAP, type "exit" at the DOS prompt. Do not restart IRAP with the "irap" command; doing so will start another copy of the program, not return you to your previous session.</p>

<p>Add<br />Choose this command to add a new variable to the library. There are two types of variable: the "file variable" and the "defined variable." In short, a file variable takes its value directly from the data. Because it is often desirable to recode data without creating a special data file, IRAP also provides "defined variables," which are specified as functions of any number of file variables.</p>
<p>Initially, IRAP presents you with a dialog for adding file variables.</p>
<p>&gt; To add a file variable</p>
<ol>
<li>Fill in the Name, Column, and Length fields with the information for this variable. Use TAB or the mouse to move between fields.</li>
<li>If the field in your data contains an implicit decimal point (e.g., 1.5 represented as "15"), enter the number of decimal places in the "Precision" field (in the above example, you would enter "1").</li>
<li>If the data file contains a numeric value which should be interpreted as "missing," then enter that value in the "Missing Code" field. Some files have several codes that mean "missing." To handle this problem, see the "Concepts" section.</li>
<li>By default, the variable will be added after the last variable in the library. If you want to insert it elsewhere, enter the position in the "Number" field.</li>
<li>Click the "Add" button, or press RETURN.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point, the dialog box will clear itself, so that you may add another variable.</p>
<p>&gt; To quit adding variables</p>
<ul>
<li>Click the "End" button, or press ESCAPE.</li>
</ul>
<p>&gt; To add a defined variable</p>
<ol>
<li>From the dialog box described above, click the "Defined Variable" button, or press Alt+D.</li>
<li>Fill in the "Name" and "Definition fields. The variable definition language is described in the "Concepts" section.</li>
<li>If you wish to define a missing code for the variable, type it in the "Missing Code" field.</li>
<li>By default, the variable will be added after the last variable in the library. If you want to insert it elsewhere, enter the position in the "Number" field.</li>
<li>Click the "Add" button, or press RETURN.</li>
</ol>
<p>Again, the dialog box will ready itself for another variable. To stop adding variables, click the "End" button, or press ESCAPE. IRAP will remember that you were adding defined variables, and return you to that dialog box the next time you add variables.</p>
<p>&gt; To return to adding file variables</p>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Click the "File Variable" button, or press Alt+F.</li>

<p>&gt; To modify a variable</p>
<ol>
<li>You will be asked which variable you want to modify. Enter the variable's name, or its number. Click the "OK" button, or press RETURN.</li>
<li>A dialog box similar to the "Add Variables" dialog will appear. Make all necessary changes to the information that is displayed.</li>

<p>Define Model<br />This command allows you to specify the contents of the model. It presents a dialog box with a field for entering each part of the model. The exact form of the dialog depends on the current sampling scheme (see the "Sampling scheme" command, below), but all versions are similar. When the program starts, the sampling scheme is "Simple Random."</p>
<p>&gt; To enter a model definition</p>
<ol>
<li>When the dialog box apears, the cursor will be in the "Case indicator" field. Type the name of the case indicator variable.</li>
<li>Using the mouse, or by pressing Alt+E or TAB, move to the "Exposures" field. Type the names of one or more exposure variables, separated by spaces.</li>
<li>If the model includes any covariates which do not contribute to attributable risk, move to the "Confounders" field. Type the names of the confounder variables, separated by spaces.</li>
<li>If the model should be fit separately for each value of one or more variables, move to the "By-variables" field. Type the variable names, separated by spaces.</li>
<li>IRAP can automatically create interactions involving any number of variables. To specify an interaction, move to the "Interactions" field. An interaction has the form
<blockquote>var1*var2</blockquote>
Type as many interactions as you wish, separating the terms of each with an asterisk ("*"), and separating different interaction with spaces.</li>
<li>IRAP can include a separate parameter to model the intercept, or use a covariate in the model to span the intercept. To span the intercept, clear the "Intercept Modeled" checkbox by clicking it with the mouse, or by pressing Alt+N.</li>
<li>When done, click the "OK" button, or press RETURN to accept the model. Click the "Cancel" button, or press ESCAPE to cancel the model definition.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although the other sampling schemes require slightly different information, the form is the same.</p>
<p>The stratified models (Stratified Random Sampling and Frequency Matching) offer a checkbox labeled "Stratifiers Modeled." When this option is checked, the stratification variables will appear in the regression model as discrete covariates. Clearing the checkbox will remove the stratification variables from the regression model, while retaining the stratification of the attributable risk estimate.</p>

<p>Convergence Criteria<br />This command is used to tune several parameters used in fitting the model. These parameters are saved by the "Save configuration" command in the "Options" menu, and restored automatically when the program starts.</p>
<p>The first line adjusts the number of iterations allowed before the regression model is deemed divergent. The second line adjusts the convergence threshold for the regression models. A larger convergence tolerance will cause the model to converge in fewer iterations. The third line adjusts the constant used to detect singular information matrices.</p>
<p>&gt; To change a convergence criterion</p>
<ol>
<li>Move to the field you want to change.</li>
<li>Enter the new value.</li>
<li>Cleck the "OK" button, or press RETURN.</li>
</ol>
<p>&gt; To restore the original values</p>

<p>Run<br />Use this command to fit the completed model. When you "run" a model, IRAP first reads the data into memory. Little is gained by creating a file that only contains the variables for a certain model; only the values which are used by the current model are actually read from the file. With the data in core, the program builds its parameter tables, then fits the model.</p>
<p>&gt; To run the model</p>
<ol>
<li>In the "Data file" field, type the name of the input file.</li>
<li>In the "Report file" field, type the name under which the model's output should be stored.</li>
<li>The report file can have up to two title lines at the top of each page. To specify a title, type its text in the "Title 1" and "Title 2" fields.</li>
<li>IRAP always computes an estimate of attributable risk for all levels of exposure combined. To produce an estimate for each individual exposure pattern as well, check the "Partial attributable risk estimates" box by clicking it with the mouse, or by pressing Alt+P.</li>
<li>By default, IRAP prints the entire file description at the beginning of its report. To suppress this list, clear the "List variable definitions" checkbox by clicking it with the mouse, or by pressing Alt+L.</li>
<li>When all settings are correct, click the "OK" button, or press RETURN.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you specify a report file which already exists, IRAP offers three options:</p>
<p>Overwrite (Alt+O) - Replace the old file with the new one.<br />Append (Alt+A) - Add the report to the end of the old file.<br />New name (Alt+N) - Go back, and enter a new name for the report.</p>

<p>Variable Columns<br />When the library becomes large, not all of the variables will fit into the "Variables" window at once. While you can always scroll through its contents to find a particular variable, life is easier if you do not need to do so. For this reason, the library can be displayed in one, two, three, or five columns, trading the number of variables displayed against the amount of information shown for each.</p>
<p>&gt; To select the number of variable columns</p>
<ol>
<li>The "Variable columns" command will offer a submenu listing the display options.</li>
<li>Click the option of your choice with the mouse, or type the number of columns you wish to see (1, 2, 3, or 5).</li>
</ol>
<p>In one column, all information is displayed about each variable, but only about 13 or 14 can be seen at once. A horizontal scroll bar will appear for viewing definitions that do not fit in one line. This mode is good for checking long variable names or definitions, but can be annoying for general use.</p>
<p>The default setting is two columns. This mode also shows all of the attributes for file variables, but it truncates variable names longer than nine characters. For defined variables, only the beginning of the definition appears, and the missing code is not shown at all.</p>
<p>In three column mode, the missing codes disappear for file variables, as well. In five columns, only the variable names themselves are displayed, but about 65 of them will fit into the window at once.</p>

<p>Automatic Tiling<br />Regardless of the variable format chosen, you may want to manually move or resize the windows, for example to hide part of the model definition in order to see more variables at once. Unfortunately, IRAP has its own idea of how the screen should look. In an effort to be helpful, the program automatically positions the variable window above the model window, so that the model window is just large enough to show the whole model, and the variable window gets the rest of the screen. This feature is called "automatic tiling," because it places the windows next to each other like tiles on a floor.</p>
<p>&gt; To turn Automatic tiling on or off</p>
<blockquote>* choose the "Automatic tiling" command from the Options menu.</blockquote>

<p>Display<br />The display command is used to change the color scheme and the display mode used by your computer. Because it depends on the video hardware in your computer, its action changes depending on your computer. Most computers that support IRAP have some form of VGA display.</p>
<p>The default choices of "color" and "25 lines" are appropriate for most cases. Two alternative color schemes, "mono" and "reverse mono," are offered; these may look better on monochrome screens. The "Lines" option offers a choice of video modes. More lines means more information, but it also means smaller type.</p>
<p>&gt; To change the color scheme</p>
<ol>
<li>click the button of your choice, or press:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Alt+L for color</li>
<li>Alt+M for monochrome</li>
<li>Alt+R for reverse monochrome.</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>Click the "OK" button, or press RETURN.</li>
</ol>
<p>&gt; To change the number of screen lines</p>
<ol>
<li>click the button of your choice, or press:
<div>
<ul>
<li>Alt+2 for 25 lines</li>
<li>Alt+4 for 43 lines</li>

<li>Click the "OK" button, or press RETURN.</li>
</ol>
<p>On a system with a CGA or Herculese display, you will find a checkbox marked "Snowy." On some systems, mostly those with CGA monitors, the screen will become snowy when the computer is updating its contents. While this is not dangerous to you or your computer, it can be extremely annoyint. If this is a problem on your screen, marking the "Snowy" box should help to alleviate it. Because the EGA and VGA displays handle the problem themselves, the option is not offered for them.</p>

<h3>Sara Schonfeld</h3>
<p><a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/schonfeld-sara">Sara Schonfeld, Ph.D.</a>, is a staff scientist in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB). No stranger to REB, Sara first joined the Branch as a summer student in 2004 seeking to apply the cancer epidemiology skills acquired during her M.P.H. program at the George Washington University. The summer turned into a year, during which she was introduced to the fields of second cancers, and occupational and environmental radiation epidemiology.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It quickly became clear that my next step was a Ph.D. in epidemiology, which I pursued at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.&rdquo; Dr. Schonfeld said. &ldquo;I was very fortunate to remain a part of REB, completing pre- and postdoctoral training in the Branch.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For her doctoral dissertation, Dr. Schonfeld pooled data from four DCEG prospective studies to investigate the associations between hormone-related risk factors and risk of breast and endometrial cancers among nulliparous women (i.e., women having no previous births).&nbsp;As a fellow, she also collaborated on studies concerned with medical, environmental, and occupational radiation exposures, and developed a strong research interest in the association between ionizing radiation exposure and cancer risk. Much of the research was conducted in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, which allowed her to combine training in epidemiology with her undergraduate degree in Russian studies.</p>
<p>During the second year of her postdoc, Dr. Schonfeld sought advice from REB mentors and colleagues on next steps. A conversation with Dr. Elaine Ron, then branch chief,&nbsp;set the wheels in motion for a very big change.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I vividly remember her saying to me &lsquo;You have to go away. You may choose to come back but you have to go away for some time. You can&rsquo;t do all of your growing up as an epidemiologist in one place.&rsquo;&rdquo; Dr. Schonfeld said.</p>
<p>Dr. Schonfeld took her advice seriously and by early 2012, accepted a position at the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) in Lyon, France. While at IARC, she worked primarily on developing a retrospective cohort study of occupational asbestos exposure and cancer mortality. Although the exposure of interest was different, her previous experiences from REB studies of radiation in the Russian Federation provided a strong foundation for the work at IARC. In return, Dr. Schonfeld gained tremendous training at IARC, particularly in terms of fieldwork and project leadership.</p>
<p>In early 2016, Dr. Schonfeld returned to REB to take on the role of staff scientist. Currently, she supports Branch research to explore the relationship between cancer treatment and the development of <a href="http://dceg.cancer.gov/research/what-we-study/second-cancers">second malignancies</a>.</p>

<p>Ionizing radiation is the only established risk factor for thyroid cancer. An international pooled analysis of 14 case-control studies of thyroid cancer (2,725 cases and 4,776 controls) was conducted to further describe the etiology of this cancer. By combining many small studies, investigators were able to explore many suspected risk factors for thyroid cancer with adequate statistical power. The pooled analysis identified goiter and benign nodules as the strongest risk factors apart from radiation. The large excess risk of thyroid cancer in females was not strongly associated with menstrual or reproductive factors. Cigarette smoking was associated with a reduced risk of thyroid cancer in both men and women. The analysis did not find any evidence for an increased risk of thyroid cancer with increased iodine intake from seafood or fish.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators have been closely associated with studies of atomic bomb survivors in Hiroshima and Nagasaki for several decades. Data from studies of the survivors are widely regarded as the gold standard in radiation risk assessment for acute, external exposure, and are the major source of information for setting international and national radiological protection standards and guidelines. A new updated cancer incidence report recently has been completed, which adds approximately 50% more cancers from the additional nine years of follow-up and uses the recently introduced DS02 dose estimates. In addition, a series of site-specific cancer incidence studies have been conducted to gain insights into radiation-related risks. These include studies of ovarian, thyroid, lung and breast cancers and lymphoid tumors. A number of molecular genetics studies are also now underway and as well as a number of new site-specific studies including studies of bladder and colon cancer, second cancers and sarcomas.</p>

Gallbladder cancer is a particularly good model for understanding inflammation-related carcinogenesis since gallstones are present in the vast majority of gallbladder cancer cases and cause substantial inflammation in the gallbladder. Measuring infection and immune responses in biological specimens can provide novel insights into carcinogenesis and disease outcomes, and identify molecular subtypes associated with each. As principal investigator for the Chile Biliary Longitudinal Study (BiLS), Biliary Tract Cancer Pooling Project (BiTCaPP), and Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study, Dr. Koshiol evaluates the epidemiology of biliary tract cancers and associations with inflammation and other immune responses to elucidate etiologic mechanisms and identify cancer-related molecular pathways and targets that one day may be used in cancer prevention.</p>

She combines multiple population-based data resources, quantifies the contribution of risk factors to time trends, and disaggregates cancer incidence and mortality rates to reveal underlying patterns and explanatory mechanisms. Currently, her research program focuses on 1) quantifying cancer risk and burden in people living with HIV; 2) estimating the impact of risk factors on changing cancer rates over time; and 3) understanding rising rates of premature mortality in the United States. Dr. Shiels is the co-principal investigator of the HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study and collaborates widely with colleagues throughout DCEG, across NIH, at the CDC, and at state cancer registries.</p>

<p>Over the last three decades, advances in treatment and supportive care have translated into steady improvements in survival after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) given for patients with leukemia and other malignant and nonmalignant diseases. With larger numbers of transplant recipients surviving long-term, concern has turned to quantifying the late effects of this treatment, particularly total-body irradiation (doses from 8 to 15 Gy), and severe immune dysfunction. Radiation Epidemiology Branch investigators have expanded and updated their previously assembled multi-institutional cohort to evaluate risk factors for new solid malignancies and posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders among nearly 30,000 allogeneic transplant recipients, thereby doubling the numbers of 5 and 10-year survivors at risk for new malignancies. Preliminary results from the expanded study show that overall, patients developed new invasive solid cancers at twice the rate expected based on general population rates with risk rising steeply over time. Results show a markedly high risk associated with radiation conditioning regimens delivered at ages under 10 years with a rapidly declining trend in both relative and absolute risks with increasing age at radiation.</p>

<p>Polymorphisms in genes might modify the effects of exogenous and endogenous carcinogens in brain tumor development. DCEG investigators have evaluated the glutathione-S-transferase and cytochrome P-450 families of genes, both of which encode enzymes involved in the metabolism of solvents and other substrates. Occupational exposure to lead might cause meningioma, and a polymorphism in a gene for an enzyme that influences blood levels of lead [delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase, (ALAD)] was positively associated with the risk of meningioma. The association between glioma risk and history of allergies is being explored by examining the relation between glioma risk and polymorphisms in cytokine genes, and polymorphisms in a large panel of genes related to innate immunity also are under study. A recent paper from this study concerning apoptosis and cell cycle control genes identified caspase 8 as a possible susceptibility gene. Analyses concerning polymorphisms in oxidative stress genes, DNA repair genes, and insulin-like growth factor genes are in progress.</p>
<p>No single epidemiological study of brain tumors has adequate statistical power to evaluate most gene-environment or gene-gene interactions. An international consortium of brain tumor epidemiological studies (BTEC) was organized so that brain tumor risks associated with genetic susceptibility and specific exposures can be evaluated in the combined studies.</p>

<p>Exposure to medical diagnostic tools involving radiation has increased dramatically among the U.S. population. DCEG researchers are assessing cancer risks associated with CT scan exposure in childhood. In addition, they are examining cancer risk associated with newer diagnostic radiologic examinations, such as high-dose nuclear medicine tests and fluoroscopically-guided interventional procedures. Researchers are studying radiation exposure from cancer treatment with the aim to quantify second cancers occurring among cancer survivors.</p>

<h2>A comparison of alternative exposure assessment methods</h2>
<p>Sun exposure has been associated with skin cancer as well as potential protection against various other cancers. Few studies have examined alternative methods to retrospectively assess exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV), particularly for women whose outdoor behavior patterns likely differ from those of men. DCEG investigators initiated a small pilot study to explore questionnaire-based UV exposure patterns and assessment methods. For one week, participants were asked to keep a diary of outdoor activities during 9am-5pm, while simultaneously wearing a personal UV dosimeter. The subjects subsequently completed surveys on their recollection of time outdoors during the study week and during their lifetime. This feasibility study was designed to evaluate patterns of outdoor behavior and the validity and reproducibility of alternative assessment methods for a one-week period, as well as the reproducibility of alternative methods of assessing lifetime sun exposure. In their evaluation of the reproducibility of hour-based and activity-based measures of lifetime UV exposure, investigators found that the activity-based approach was more reproducible during adult ages and over the lifetime, primarily due to the reports of women. (Yu CL et al. <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19190171">Assessment of lifetime cumulative sun exposure using a self-administered questionnaire: reliability of two approaches.</a> <i>Cancer Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev</i> 2009; 18: 464-7).</p>
<p>Investigators are also assessing the choice of non-questionnaire surrogates for individual exposure to UVR.&nbsp;To guide the choice of surrogates for long-term UVR exposure, they are examining how well stable sun-related individual characteristics, such as skin sun-sensitivity, and environmental/climatic factors predict daily personal UVR exposure measurements as measured by these personal UVR dosimeters.</p>

<p>Hand-held cellular telephones are used close to the head and there is concern that the radiofrequency (RF) energy produced by these devices may affect the brain and nervous system tissue in the head. Researchers have focused on whether RF energy can cause malignant (cancerous) brain tumors such as gliomas (cancers of the brain that begin in the glial cells, which are cells that surround and support nerve cells), as well as benign (non-cancerous) tumors, such as acoustic neuromas (tumors that arise in the cells of the nerve that supplies the ear) and meningiomas (tumors that occur in the meninges, which are the membranes that cover and protect the brain and spinal cord).&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a result of public and Congressional concern, DCEG investigators launched an early study and found no relationship between cell phone use and risk of glioma or meningioma (Inskip et al., <i>NEJM</i> 2001). &nbsp;A more recent Danish study linked a roster of 358,403 cellular phone subscribers with records in the Danish Cancer Register and did not observe evidence of increased risk of glioma or meningioma, either overall or for persons with subscriptions exceeding 10 years (Frei et al,, <i>BMJ</i> 2011). &nbsp;A recent multicenter, international study also reported no relationship between cell phone use and meningioma (Interphone, <i>Int J Epidemiol</i> 2010). &nbsp;However, the same investigators reported increased risk of glioma in a small group of the heaviest users, but no indication of increasing risk with increasing level or duration of use. &nbsp;In contrast, a Swedish study (Hardell et al., <i>Int J Oncol</i> 2011) reported substantially higher estimates of the risk of glioma in relation to cell phone use as compared to these other studies.</p>
<p>In a 2012 study (Little et al., <i>BMJ</i> 2012), DCEG researchers compared observed glioma incidence rates from cancer registries in NCI&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program from 1992 to 2008, with projected rates based on risks observed in the Interphone study (2010)&nbsp;and the Swedish study (2011). Over the entire study period, glioma incidence patterns held roughly constant in all age groups. Projections based on the Interphone study, which found slight increases in risk among a small number of heavy users, were not statistically distinguishable from the observed U.S. rates. On the other hand, projections based on the Swedish study were at least 40 percent higher than, and incompatible with, the observed U.S. rates.&nbsp;</p>
<p>DCEG researchers have conducted a series of studies of time trends on U.S. incidence rates (Inskip et al., <i>Neuro Oncol</i> 2010, Little et al., <i>BMJ</i> 2012, Withrow et al. <em>CEBP</em>, 2018). This coincides with a period when there has been a substantial increase in usage of mobile phones in the U.S. population. They found little evidence for any change in rates of brain cancer overall or for glioma, the most common type of brain cancer. DCEG researchers plan to continue surveillance of glioma rates and changing usage patterns and technology of cell phones.</p>

<h3 id="Why">Why Study Epidemiology?</h3>
<p>Epidemiology is often called the science of public health. It is described as the study of the distribution and determinants of disease risk in human populations. Epidemiologists study a diverse range of health conditions as well as the impact that various exposures have on the manifestation of disease. DCEG research has had tremendous <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=34&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=303763" sys_contentid="303763" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7232957" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303763" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_siteid="475">impact on public health</a>.</p>
<h3 id="Research">DCEG Research Portfolio</h3>
<h4>Epidemiology and Biostatistics Research</h4>

Welch Fellowship is a competitive program for postdoctoral fellows applying to train in the National Cancer Institute's Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). The fellowship supports mentored research in molecular epidemiology with special emphasis on the application of emerging genetic and genomic technology. The fellowship also includes support for annual travel to a scientific conference with a focus on genetic or genomic technology.</p>
<p>The fellowship is named in honor of Robert A. Welch, the founding Director of Operations of the NCI-Frederick <a href="http://cgf.nci.nih.gov/">Cancer Genomics Research Laboratory</a> (CGR), formerly known as the Core Genotyping Facility. Mr. Welch played a key role in developing and managing the CGR, which carries out large-scale studies of common genetic variations and cancer. His skill, dedication, and hard work were major contributions to the CGR's success. His commitment and leadership inspired his colleagues at the CGR and elsewhere, and the CGR continues to work toward his vision.</p>

<p>This is a R package implementing the Bayeisan model for detecting gene environment interaction described in the following manucript. An important follow-up step after genetic markers are found to be associated with a disease outcome is a more detailed analysis investigating how the associated gene or a chromosomal region and an established environment risk factor interact to influence the disease risk. The standard approach to this study of gene-environment interaction considers one genetic marker at a time, and therefore could misrepresent and underestimate the genetic contribution to the joint effect when one or more functional loci, some of which might not be genotyped, exist in the region and interact with the environment risk factor in a complex way. We develop a more global approach based on a Bayesian model that uses a latent genetic profile variable to capture all of the genetic variation in the entire targeted region and allows the environment effect to vary across different genetic profile categories.</p>

<p>The Health Professionals Follow-up Study (HPFS) questionnaire had the following questions involving chicken skin.</p>
<p><em>When you eat chicken, is it usually cooked with skin on?<br />Answer: <strong>yes/no</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Do you usually eat the skin?<br />Answer: <strong>yes/no</strong></em></p>
<p>Three chicken/skin combinations were possible:</p>
<ul class="bullet-blu">
<li>chicken cooked and eaten with skin,</li>
<li>chicken cooked with skin but not eaten with skin,</li>
<li>and chicken cooked without skin.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Charred database was developed with questionnaires that asked if the respondent ate skin but did not include the question on whether the chicken was cooked with skin. Therefore, the Charred values are based on a mean of cooked with skin and without skin.</p>
<p>For the HPFS study, heterocyclic amines (HCA) intake and meat derived mutagenicity from chicken was calculated using specific values from the database developed at NCI. This database contained measurements on HCA and meat derived mutagenicity for different types of chicken (white boneless chicken, white chicken meat and bone, dark boneless chicken and dark chicken meat and bone) prepared using different cooking methods (pan-fried, grilled/barbequed and broiled) and doneness levels (just, well and very). In addition, the database contained HCA and meat derived mutagenicity measurements for white chicken skin and dark chicken skin separately.</p>
<p>The three types of chicken/skin combinations, specific examples, and the final values used follow.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Chicken cooked and eaten with skin:</strong><br />The values can be obtained directly from the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302546" sys_contentid="302546" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7143184" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302546" rxinlineslot="103">Charred Database</a><i><strong>.<br /><br /></strong></i></li>
<li><strong>Chicken cooked without skin<br /></strong>To calculate HCA for chicken cooked without skin we computed a weighted average of the HCA measurements from white boneless chicken and dark boneless chicken. For pan fried chicken the weights used were 1/3 for white meat and 2/3 for dark meat. For broiled and grilled chicken the split was evenly at 1/2 for both white meat and dark meat.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Chicken cooked with skin but not eaten with skin<br /></strong>HCA values for chicken cooked with skin but not eaten with skin were computed by calculating a weighted average for white chicken with bone and dark chicken with bone using the same weights for white and dark meat as mentioned above for pan fried, broiled and grilled chicken.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The following examples illustrate the three different combinations for pan fried, just done chicken for PhIP.</strong></p>

<h2>About the Study</h2>
<p>Chordoma is a rare bone cancer that is diagnosed in only about 300 patients in the U.S. each year. It develops at the base of the skull, in a vertebra, or at end of the spine (in the sacrum or the coccyx [the tail bone]) with about equal frequency. The cells that give rise to chordoma come from the notochord. The notochord is an important structure in the early embryo that disappears before birth. However, even after birth, some cells from the notochord remain in bones at the base of the skull, in vertebrae, and in the tail bone. Rarely, one of these cells, which are called notochord remnants, undergoes changes that give rise to a chordoma.</p>
<p>Chordoma is diagnosed most often in people who are in their late 50s, but it can occur much earlier or later. It develops in males more often than females and, for unknown reasons, is rare in African Americans. There are few effective treatments and no cure for chordoma. Most people with chordoma die within 10 years of diagnosis.</p>
<p>No specific environmental factors that increase the risk of developing chordoma have been identified. And, the vast majority of people with chordoma have no other family members with this cancer. However, a small number of families with multiple relatives with chordoma have been reported worldwide. In most of them, chordoma has occurred in a parent and one or more of his/her children. This pattern suggests that in these families, chordoma results from the presence of an altered or mutated gene that has been passed from the affected parent to some of his/her children.</p>
<h3 id="background">Background</h3>
<p>NCI&nbsp;investigators have been studying chordoma families (families with multiple relatives with chordoma) since 1996. Recently, they identified the altered gene that caused chordoma to develop in members of four of these families. The altered gene is the <i>T</i> gene on the long arm of chromosome 6. The way in which the <i>T</i> gene is altered in these families is unusual. The sequence of the DNA within this gene has not been changed or mutated; instead the entire <i>T</i> gene has been duplicated.</p>
<p>The <i>T</i> gene makes a protein called brachyury that plays an important role in the development of the notochord. Brachyury is present in notochord cells and also in chordomas, but it is not found in most other types of cancer or in the normal cells around a chordoma. At the present time, no one knows why an extra copy of the <i>T</i> gene in members of these four families increases their risk of developing chordoma.</p>
<p>Some of the chordoma families studied by investigators did not have an extra copy of the <i>T</i> gene. This suggests that mutations of other gene(s) or an as yet unidentified process involving the <i>T</i> gene caused the increased risk for chordoma in these families.</p>
<h3 id="purpose">DCEG Chordoma Research</h3>
<p>The goals of the research are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Find the genes that cause chordoma to occur in multiple relatives in a chordoma family;</li>
<li>Describe the clinical findings in people with familial chordoma;</li>
<li>Determine whether families prone to chordoma are at increased risk of other types of cancer;</li>
<li>Develop better health care choices for families who have an increased risk for developing chordoma; and,</li>
<li>Determine whether the genes that are altered in members of chordoma families play a role in the development of chordoma in people without a family history of this cancer in the general population.</li>
</ul>
<p>DCEG&nbsp;investigators are seeking chordoma families to participate in research to identify additional genes that increase the risk of family members developing chordoma. To learn more, please see our research on <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=22&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=303761" sys_contentid="303761" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="303761" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7270597" sys_siteid="475">Familial Chordoma</a>.</p>
<p>DCEG&nbsp;investigators are also seeking individuals with chordoma who are the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">only</span> member of their family with this cancer. These types of individuals may participate in research to determine whether &ldquo;familial chordoma&rdquo; genes play a role in causing people without a family history of chordoma to develop this cancer.

<p>The goal of the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=26&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302432" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302432" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_relationshipid="7126409" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="302432">Laboratory of Translational Genomics</a> (LTG) is to develop new approaches to the study of the genetic basis of cancer and its outcomes. LTG has developed expertise in bio-informatics and advanced genetic analyses with new platforms designed to test dense sets of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are the most common genetic variants in the human genome. Specifically, the laboratory has integrated approaches to identify and validate common SNPs and ancestral haplotypes, which could be used to dissect the genetic basis of disease susceptibility. LTG utilizes programs and approaches in population genetics, epidemiology and molecular evolution, which assist in the choice and analysis of genetic variants under study. Recently, the focus of LTG has shifted to dissect the genetic basis of SNP markers validated in large scale, genome-wide association studies (GWAS). This new approach can identify new regions to be studied in great detail and eventually applied to large molecular epidemiology studies to estimate the magnitude of the effect. It will also be possible to investigate the interaction between genes and environmental factors.</p>

<p>Between 1946 and 1958 the United States tested 66 nuclear weapons on or near Bikini and Enewetak atolls, which had previously been evacuated. NCI investigators concluded, based on extensive analyses described in their publications, that populations living on any of the other atolls in the Marshall Islands archipelago were exposed to measurable radioactive fallout from 20 of those tests.</p>
<p>In this carefully considered analysis, National Cancer Institute (NCI) experts estimate that as much as 1.6% of all cancers among those residents of the Marshall Islands alive between 1948 and 1970 might be attributable to radiation exposures resulting from nuclear testing fallout. Due to uncertainly inherent to these analyses, the authors calculated a 90% confidence interval of 0.4% to 3.6%.</p>

<h2 id="purpose">Purpose of the NCI Investigation</h2>
<p>In June 2004, the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources asked the NCI to provide its expert opinion on the baseline cancer risk and number of cancers expected among residents of the Marshall Islands as a result of exposures to radioactive fallout from U.S. nuclear weapons tests that were conducted there from 1946 through 1958. In September 2004, the NCI provided the Committee with preliminary cancer risk estimates and a discussion of their basis in a report titled <!--<a href="/files/9-28Response_appendix.pdf"> -->Estimation of the Baseline Number of Cancers Among Marshallese and the Number of Cancers Attributable to Exposure to Fallout from Nuclear Weapons Testing Conducted in the Marshall Islands (PDF)<!--</a> -->. That analysis was based on a number of conservative assumptions designed to avoid underestimating the actual cancer risks and used information that could be collected quickly to provide a timely response.</p>
<p>In a considerably more thorough analysis published in the August 2010 issue of the journal <i>Health Physics</i>, NCI presents revised estimates of the number of excess (radiation-related) cancers for those residents who were exposed to radioactive fallout. These findings, reported in eight papers covering the subjects of external dose, internal dose, cancer risk projections, as well as the methodologies of dose reconstruction, are the result of several years of work to provide more precise estimates of cancer risk.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">[Return to top]</a></p>
<h2 id="summary_analyses">Summary of Analyses and Results</h2>
<p>NCI's findings are based on the most detailed dose reconstruction to date. The analyses include populations living on all inhabited atolls (except the nuclear test site atolls which were unoccupied) and include dose contributions from each of the 20 nuclear tests that resulted in measurable fallout according to the NCI analysis.</p>
<p>The investigators estimated tissue-specific absorbed doses at all historically inhabited atolls from internal (ingested) and external radiation. The information is presented by atoll, nuclear test, and year of age of the population at time of exposure. The assessment of cancer risks is for all Marshallese alive at any time during the years 1948 through 1970.</p>
<p>The authors estimate that as much as 1.6% of all cancers (about 170 cancers) among those alive between 1948 and 1970 might be attributable to radiation exposures resulting from nuclear testing fallout. Due to uncertainly inherent to these analyses, the authors calculated a 90% confidence interval of 0.4% to 3.6%. For specific populations the doses and the risk varied widely depending on location. People living in northern atoll locations received higher doses and were subject to greater cancer risks. For the 82 people who lived on Rongelap atoll, the authors projected 55% of all cancers might be attributed to fallout exposure. For Utrik, where 157 people were exposed, 10% of all cancers might be attributed to fallout. For the much larger populations exposed in mid-latitude and southern atolls (e.g., Kwajalein and Majuro), about 2% or 1% (respectively) could be due to fallout. Confidence bounds were also calculated for these estimates.</p>
<p>The completed analysis projects about 170 excess cancers (radiation-related cases) to occur among more than 25,000 Marshallese, half of whom were born before 1948. This estimate is considerably lower than the 500 cases (9% of all cancers) projected by NCI in the preliminary response to the Senate request in 2004. That analysis, produced quickly, was purposely intended to avoid underestimation of the true cancer risk.</p>
<p>The estimated 170 excess cancers occurred in the context of about 10,600 cancers that would have spontaneously arisen among the same cohort of Marshallese for reasons unrelated to fallout. In the absence of reliable cancer incidence data from the Marshall Islands, the NCI investigators used the <a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/">NCI Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)</a> database that tracks cancer incidence in a representative sample of the United States population. At the time of this analysis, the authors expect that all but about 65 of the 170 projected radiation-related cancers have already developed in the population.</p>

<h3 id="comparison">Comparison of Published Estimates to Preliminary Figures Provided to Congress</h3>
<p>The preliminary analysis conducted in 2004 was based on a number of conservative assumptions designed to avoid underestimating the actual cancer risks. The researchers used available information that could be collected quickly to provide a timely response. The present report was a scientifically rigorous study based on a more thorough and painstaking gathering of exposure data.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">[Return to top]</a></p>
<h3 id="expected">Expected Cancer Types</h3>
<p>While most cancer types can be related to radiation exposure, certain organs appear more susceptible to the cancer-causing effects of the exposure. For this reason, the NCI estimated risks for the four cancers most likely to occur given the nature of the fallout exposures. They are cancers of the thyroid, stomach, and colon, as well as leukemia.</p>
<p>The percentage of cancers expected from the exposure to fallout varied by location of the population during the years of exposure. The lowest values are for residents of the southern atolls during the testing years, while highest values are for members of the Rongelap community in the northern atolls. The corresponding percentages of cancers due to radiation in the two locations are as follows: thyroid cancer (12% and 95%), leukemia (2% and 78%), stomach (1% and 48%), colon (1% and 64%), and all cancers combined (1% and 55%).</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">[Return to top]</a></p>
<h2 id="summary_methods">Summary of Research Methods</h2>
<p>These improved estimates resulted from an extensive effort by NCI scientists over three years to collect and analyze all available relevant data, including many historical documents from the Atomic Energy Commission laboratory that conducted the fallout monitoring for the U.S. nuclear testing program. These historical measurements were collected, re-reviewed, and systematically integrated with more contemporary environmental radiation measurement data. In addition, scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration assisted NCI investigators with interpreting historical meteorological data and provided meteorological models to assist in reconstructing fallout deposition patterns. These new resources allowed investigators to construct exposure estimates for every atoll and from all nuclear tests conducted in the Marshall Islands.</p>
<p>Using the refined estimates of radiation doses, the investigators at NCI calculated cancer risks by applying statistical models for dose-specific risks from a recent report by an expert committee of the U.S. National Academies. As with any historical risk assessment of this kind, fallout-related radiation doses and associated cancer risks cannot be determined exactly and so are presented in the form of a "best" estimate and a range, consistent with the available data. This range is based on dose estimates from the study and the larger body of information from studies of cancer risk in other radiation-exposed populations. NCI investigators believe these efforts have resulted in substantially more accurate and judicious conclusions.</p>

<h2 id="summary_exposure">Summary of Radioactive Fallout Exposure from Testing for Residents of the Marshall Islands</h2>
<p>Nuclear testing took place on the islands and lagoons of Bikini Atoll and Enewetak Atoll or in nearby ocean waters. Radioactive debris from the detonations was dispersed into the atmosphere and was generally blown by the predominantly easterly winds towards the open ocean west of the Marshall Islands. In many cases, however, the winds at different altitudes blew in different directions, and upon occasion carried radioactive fallout to inhabited atolls. The radioactive debris that fell to the ground is termed fallout. The radiation doses resulting from fallout deposited on the atolls include three components: (1) doses from external radiation emitted by fallout deposited on the ground; (2) doses from ingested radioactive particles immediately or soon after fallout deposition, including accidental ingestion of particles, contamination of food, plates and eating utensils, as well as hands and faces; and (3) doses from contaminated seafood and locally grown fruits and vegetables, which occurred over long periods of time (months to years) after the fallout was deposited.</p>
<p>Radiation doses received by the residents of the Marshall Islands differed greatly by geographic location and year of birth. Of special concern is exposure at an early age because, in general, young children are more sensitive to radiation damage and received higher doses of radiation than adults.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top">[Return to top]</a></p>
<h2 id="summary_doses">Summary of Radiation Doses</h2>
<p>The larger population residing on the southern atolls received the lowest doses. Permanent residents of the southern atolls who were of adult age at the beginning of the testing period received external doses ranging from 5 to 12 mGy on average. In contrast, the external doses to adults at the mid-latitude atolls ranged from 22 to 60 mGy on average, while the residents of the northern atolls received external doses in the hundreds to over 2000 mGy. The doses received by residents of the northern atolls were essentially due to a single test, Castle-Bravo, which was detonated in 1954 and led to evacuation of the northern atolls to avert continued exposure.</p>
<p>Internal doses were calculated for the thyroid, red bone marrow, stomach wall, and colon wall. The internal doses were found to vary as a function of location, age at exposure, and type of organ or tissue. The thyroid doses were higher than the doses to the other organs and tissues. Average thyroid doses to adults ranged from 12 to 34 mGy in the southern atolls, from 67 to 160 mGy in the mid-latitude atolls, and from 760 to 7,600 mGy in the northern atolls.</p>
<p>By comparison, the annual dose from external radiation arising from exposure to natural radiation from the environment is 1 mGy in the U.S. and the dose from a single CT scan of the abdomen is typically 10 mGy.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background and History of this Investigation</h2>
<p>In June 2004, the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources asked the NCI to provide its expert opinion on the baseline cancer risk and number of cancers expected among residents of the Marshall Islands as a result of exposures to radioactive fallout. In September 2004, the NCI provided the Committee with preliminary estimates and a discussion of their basis. In the summer of 2005, the U.S. House Committees on Natural Resources and on International Relations, Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, convened a joint oversight hearing on the "United States Nuclear Legacy in the Marshall Islands: Consideration of Issues Relating to the Changed Circumstances Petition". The Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources conducted a hearing on the same topic. At those hearings, NCI investigators summarized their 2004 analysis and specified plans to develop and submit for publication in the peer-reviewed literature refined estimates of doses and cancer risks and the methods employed to derive them. From 2005 to 2008, with assistance from experts at other federal agencies, NCI radiation dosimetrists and statisticians have worked to improve the 2004 estimates and their documentation. In December 2008, the manuscripts were submitted to <i>Health Physics</i> for extensive anonymous scientific peer review, followed by publication in August 2010.</p>

    <content><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>The last three decades have seen dramatic improvements in cancer survival, mainly due to advances in treatment and the increased detection of cancer at an early stage. With more than 15 million cancer survivors in the U.S. alone, concern has turned to potential late effects, particularly the development of a new malignancy. To identify groups of cancer survivors&nbsp;who are at increased risk for multiple primary cancers, investigators in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) led a collaborative effort to provide the first comprehensive population-based analysis of the risk of subsequent cancer in the U.S., published in 2006 as a monograph entitled&nbsp;<a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/archive/publications/mpmono/MPMonograph_complete.pdf">New Malignancies Among Cancer Survivors: SEER Cancer Registries, 1973-2000 (PDF, 3.1MB)</a>,&nbsp;Curtis RE, Freedman DM, Ron E, Ries LAG, Hacker D, Edwards B, Tucker P, Fraumeni JF, Jr., editors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The 500-page monograph utilized data from nine cancer registries participating in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from 1973 to 2000. The monograph describes the patterns of subsequent cancer risk for over 50 adult first primary cancers and 19 types of childhood cancers, by gender, age at initial diagnosis, time since diagnosis, initial treatment by radiation, and histologic type. Each chapter focuses on a specific initial cancer, presents the risk of subsequent cancers, and discusses potential causal mechanisms. The monograph provides a resource that will be useful to clinicians, researchers, policy makers, and cancer survivors, especially in tailoring appropriate guidelines and strategies for prevention and early detection of new malignancies. Other studies have evaluated risk of subsequent cancers for individual cancer types or groups of cancers, usually related to the late effects of treatment, but this report provides the first complete evaluation of subsequent cancer risk in the U.S.</p>
<p>The survey of 2 million cancer survivors (including 76,000 20-year survivors) revealed that 9.1% (n = 186,000) developed a new malignancy. Development of a second cancer was likely dependent on multiple factors, including tobacco use, alcohol use, hormonal influences, viral infections, genetic predisposition, and the adverse effects of treatment. Risks of developing a new malignancy were substantially higher among children (relative risks of 6-fold) than among adults. Expanded use of aggressive cancer treatments, particularly combined modality radiotherapy and chemotherapy, likely contributed to the increased incidence of second malignancies. The highest treatment-related risks were apparent for children and young adults. Overall, radiotherapy for most adult-onset cancers (at age 50 or older) was not associated with a large increase in subsequent cancer risk, except in specific patient subgroups (e.g., 10-year survivors of breast cancer treated with high dose radiotherapy to the chest wall and lymph nodes had excess subsequent cancers of the esophagus, bone, soft tissue, and lung).</p>
<p>The monograph&rsquo;s results reveal variation in the burden of second cancers among cancer survivors. Combined tobacco and alcohol use likely accounted for a substantial excess of subsequent cancers following initial upper aerodigestive and respiratory tract cancers. Because of shared reproductive risk factors, cancers of the breast, uterine corpus, and ovary tended to cluster as multiple tumors within individual survivors. Increased risks of certain subsequent malignancies among younger patients (e.g., colon, ovarian, or breast cancer following initial breast cancer) suggested possible genetic predisposition. Evidence of virally-related second tumors was noted for initial cancers of the cervix and anus and for Kaposi sarcoma. The monograph&rsquo;s identification of patient groups at increased risk for secondary malignancy should lead to the implementation of early diagnosis programs and reduction of morbidity and mortality associated with late cancer occurrence.</p>

<p>MultiAssoc is a MATLAB software package for test of association of a disease with a group of SNPs after accounting for their interaction with another group of SNPs or environmental exposures. In addition to implementing two standard logistic regression based tests, the package implements a novel method, called TukAssoc , that uses the Tukey&rsquo;s 1 d.f. model for interaction between two groups of covariates.</p>

<p>A cohort of about 3,000 individuals who were irradiated during childhood for benign head and neck conditions at Michael Reese Hospital was assembled and monitored for the risk of thyroid and other cancers. The thyroid cancer recurrence rate was significantly lower in patients diagnosed at screening than routine medical care, however, the difference was limited to small tumors (smaller than 10 mm). Investigators also noted that the main factors for the excess of multiple tumors occurring in conjunction with thyroid cancers were radiation-related, rather than a more general increased host susceptibility or the clinical characteristics of the thyroid cancer.</p>

<p>The Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Macro (commonly referred to as the Gail Model) is a SAS macro that &nbsp;projects absolute risk of invasive breast cancer in the batch mode, according to <a href="https://bcrisktool.cancer.gov/">NCI&rsquo;s Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool</a> (BCRAT) algorithm for specific race/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Users enter data on risk factors and projection interval ages for a group of women, and the macro will return the corresponding absolute risk projections.

<p>DCEG investigators conduct a study of 35,573 patients treated for hyperthyroidism to determine whether post-therapeutic leukemia or other malignancies occurred more often in patients receiving Iodine-131 treatment compared to patients receiving antithyroid drugs or surgery.</p>
<p>To reconstruct the organ doses due to oral administration of Iodine-131, DCEG dosimetrists developed a new biokinetic model for iodine for hyperthyroid patients. Parameters of the model were obtained from results of measurements of iodine in blood, urine, and the thyroid following treatments for thyrotoxicosis for 3,138 patients. For these patients with available measured data, the individual organ doses were calculated based on the administered activity of Iodine-131 and the predictions of the amounts of iodide and protein-bound-iodine present in each organ and tissue, as well as the biological behavior of iodine in the body. Estimation of organ doses to all cohort members is in progress.</p>

<p>NestedCohort is an R software package for fitting Kaplan-Meier and Cox Models to estimate standardized survival and attributable risks for studies where covariates of interest are observed on only a sample of the cohort. Standard designs that can be handled by this software include the case-cohort and case-control studies conducted within defined cohorts. At this time, the software does not yet support nested case-control designs.</p>

<p>The mission of the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch (IIB) is to discover infectious causes of cancer, to elucidate the determinants of malignancy for established oncogenic infections, and to clarify how alterations in immunity and inflammation relate to cancer risk. At least 15% of cancers are directly related to known infectious agents, and many more result from chronic inflammation or dysfunctional immunity.</p>
<p>Current areas of emphasis include malignancies among people with AIDS or organ transplant, Burkitt lymphoma, other lymphomas, Kaposi sarcoma, and cancers of the stomach, gallbladder, liver, cervix, other HPV-related sites, oral cavity, nasopharynx, and lung. In addition to evaluating the role of infectious agents in these tumors, we are interested in evaluating the role of immunity in cancer development. IIB houses the community-based Costa Rica HPV 16/18 Vaccine Trial and other large field studies designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the HPV 16/18 virus-like particle vaccine and examine other factors of etiological and immunologic relevance.</p>
<p>In collaboration with laboratory scientists, clinicians, and statisticians, IIB uses appropriate designs (cohort, case-control, registry matching, and others) to conduct multidisciplinary research studies in domestic and international sites. In addition to epidemiologic and clinical data, many IIB field studies include an extensive biological specimen collection component that allows for careful molecular testing to better define both exposures and outcomes of interest. Descriptive epidemiology studies aimed at quantifying and explaining national and international trends in cancer incidence and mortality are also a focus.</p>
<p>Working closely with tenured and tenure-track investigators, fellows take lead responsibility for analyzing and summarizing previously collected data. Senior staff assist them in writing manuscripts and bringing these to publication in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Fellows become familiar with the entire IIB portfolio and are encouraged to participate in on-going and newly proposed studies within the Branch and throughout the Division. Advice on scientific and career development is provided to all fellows. To discuss potential opportunities in your area of research interest, you may contact <a href="http://dceg2.cancer.gov/cgi-bin/Personnel.pl?2=IIB">branch investigators</a> directly. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=157&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302548" sys_contentid="302548" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7312295" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302548" rxinlineslot="103">Meet fellows in the Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch</a>.</p>

<p>Far more than for any other common environmental cause of human cancer, the relationship between radiation dose to a population, individual, or organ site and subsequent cancer risk is well understood, and quantified. This fact led to a Congressional mandate (Public Law 97-414, Section 7(b)) to create a set of summary tables which might be used to help evaluate the merits of compensation claims for cancer cases thought to have been caused by radiation exposure.</p>
<p>In 1985, the NIH published the so-called NIH radioepidemiological tables (NIH Publication 85-2748). In 2003, a revised report was published - <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1500&amp;sys_contentid=303007" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="7276100" sys_dependentvariantid="1500" sys_dependentid="303007" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1500" sys_contentid="303007">NIH No. 03-5387 pdf, 1.05mb</a>. A hard copy of this report is available from the <a href="mailto:cisocc@mail.nih.gov">NCI Publications Ordering Service</a>.</p>
<p>In 2003 the tables were replaced with a web-based program called, <a href="https://www.irep.nci.nih.gov/irep">Interactive Radio-Epidemiological computer Program (IREP)</a>. A variant of this program, called NIOSH-IREP, was adapted by the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/homepage.html">National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)</a> for adjudication of radiation-related claims by employees of the Department of Energy and its contractors, in accordance with Public Law 106-398 (the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act of 2000). That program and related material can be accessed from the website of the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/ocas/ocasirep.html">NIOSH Office of Compensation Analysis and Support, "Probability of Causation (NIOSH-IREP)</a>".</p>

<p>In order to study cancer and other serious disease risks associated with protracted low-to-moderate dose radiation exposures, scientists identified a nationwide population of 146,022 radiologic technologists, certified for two or more years during 1926-1982, from the American Registry of Radiologic Technologists (ARRT). The technologists have been followed from 1983 to the present to obtain data on employment history and cancer risk factor information for investigations of mortality, cancer incidence, cataract, and cardiovascular disease risks as well as health risks among those conducting certain types of radiologic procedures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Efforts are underway to estimate annual and cumulative doses of individual technologists to enable assessment of occupational radiation-related dose-response patterns. The potential modification of breast and thyroid cancer risks by genetic susceptibility factors has also been investigated. Genetic studies of breast, thyroid and skin cancer are ongoing.&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a id="Summary of Cancer Risks"></a>Summary of Cancer Risks</h3>
<h4>Leukemia, multiple myeloma, and lymphoma</h4>
<p>Relative risks of the combined category of acute myelocytic, acute lymphocytic, and chronic myeloid leukemias were increased among technologists working five or more years before 1950 or holding patients 50 or more times for x-ray examinations, but risks were not significantly related to working in more recent time periods, the year or age technologists first worked, the total years worked, specific procedures or equipment used or personal radiotherapy. Working as a radiologic technologist was not significantly associated with risk of multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Hodgkin lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.</p>
<h4>Breast cancer</h4>
<p>Based on 1,050 incident breast cancers, risks were 2.9-fold increased among technologists who began working before 1935. Risks rose with number of years worked before 1940, and were significantly elevated among those who began working before age 17, but were not related to the total years worked in the 1940s or later. The risk was 1.5-fold and significantly greater for those technologists with the highest proxy index of cumulative occupational radiation exposure compared to those with a minimal exposure index.</p>
<h4>Thyroid cancer</h4>
<p>A statistically significant 1.5-fold elevated risk of thyroid cancer was observed among technologists who held patients for x-ray procedures at least 50 times. Total years worked as a radiologic technologist, years performing diagnostic, therapeutic, and nuclear medicine procedures, first employment at ages younger than 20 years, and calendar period of first employment were not associated with thyroid cancer risk. Risk of thyroid cancers diagnosed before completion of the baseline questionnaire (1983-89) were higher among those who began working in earlier decades and significantly elevated among those working more than five years prior to 1950.</p>
<h4>Non-melanoma skin cancer</h4>
<p>Among 1,355 incident cases of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) and 270 with squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in 65,304 white radiologic technologists, relative risk of BCC was 2.2-fold increased among those who first worked before 1940, but declined with more recent first year of employment. Ultraviolet radiation exposure did not modify the effect of year first worked on BCC risk, although risks were significantly stronger among technologists with lighter compared with darker eye and hair color. This study provides some evidence that chronic occupational radiation exposure at low-to-moderate levels can increase the risk of BCC, and that this risk may be modified by pigment characteristics.</p>
<h4>Melanoma</h4>
<p>Melanoma risk was increased among those who first worked before 1950, particularly among those who worked five or more years, but this finding was based on small numbers of technologists. Risk was also modestly elevated among technologists who did not customarily use a lead apron or shield when they first began working</p>
<p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a id="Lifestyle Risk Factors"></a>Lifestyle Risk Factors</h3>
<p>The U.S. Radiologic Technologists Study (USRT) Cohort has been particularly useful in examining issues related to the growing prevalence of obesity, including the nature of the relationship between body mass index and all-cause mortality. In addition, investigators are studying the risk of cancer associated with physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking.</p>
<p><a href="#Top">Back to Top</a></p>
<h3><a id="Technologists Performing or Assisting with Interventional Radiographic Procedures"></a>Technologists Performing or Assisting with Interventional Radiographic Procedures</h3>
<p>Among technologists who completed a questionnaire during 1994-1998 and were followed up through 2003, there were 3,581 deaths. Compared to radiologic technologists who never or rarely performed or assisted with fluoroscopically-guided interventional procedures, mortality was not increased overall, nor from total circulatory disease, total cancer or breast cancer among those working with such procedures daily. Based on small numbers of deaths, there were non-significant excesses (40-70%) in mortality from cerebrovascular disease among technologists ever working with these procedures, but no significant increases in technologists performing the highest frequency of such procedures. The findings should be interpreted cautiously in light of the small numbers of deaths, inability to assess risks for less common cancers, and relatively short follow-up. In addition, several genetic studies are under way in this cohort.</p>

<p>Follow-up though Dec 31, 2002 has been completed for a study of site-specific cancer mortality among tuberculosis (TB) patients treated with artificial lung collapse therapy in Massachusetts TB sanatoria (1930-1950). Treatment involved frequent chest fluoroscopy examinations, which delivered highly fractionated radiation doses to breast, lung, and other thoracic organs. The estimated mean doses to breast and lung for these patients are 0.74 and 0.84 Gy, respectively. In earlier analyses, breast cancer but not lung cancer was linked to cumulative radiation dose. Those results are consistent with the other cohort of tuberculosis patients exposed to chest fluoroscopy in Canada. Acquiring new cancer cases, particularly lung cancer, should allow DCEG investigators to conduct a more detailed dose-response analysis and refine risk estimates for fractionated radiation.</p>

<p><strong><u>Introduction:</u></strong></p>
<p>PGA is a package of algorithms and graphical user interfaces developed in Matlab for power and sample size calculation in case-control genetic association studies. The software comprises a wide verity of genetic models and statistical constraints and hence may facilitate decision making for case-control association studies of candidate genes, fine-mapping studies, and whole-genome scans.</p>
<p><strong><u>Download and installation:</u></strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To install the PGA, save the pga.exe file in an appropriate folder on your disk. Click on it, to extract the folder to a designated location on your hard drive.</li>
<li><b>Users without Matlab software should install first the MATLAB Component Runtime (MCR) on their computers. To install the MCR component, double-click on the &lsquo;MCRInstaller.exe&rsquo; file and follow the installation instructions.</b></li>
<li>Ensure that the MCR is installed on your computer in C:\Program Files\MATLAB\MATLAB_Component_Runtime\v76 or in the folder you selected in the installation process. Once the MCR is installed, you can download and run the different PGA stand-alone GUIs (pga1.exe, pga2.exe and edf.exe.</li>
</ul>
<p>** The MCR is needed to be installed only once.</p>
<p><strong><u>Software description:</u></strong></p>
<p><strong><u>PGA1:</u></strong></p>
<p>PGA1 calculates and plot the relation between statistical power and sample size for a variety of genetic and statistical parameters. The user can determine the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="bullet-blu">
<li>Type of genetic variation &ndash; SNP or Haplotype</li>
<li>Genetic mode of inheritance &ndash; Recessive, Dominant, Co-dominant(1df) or Co-dominant(2df).</li>
<li>Relative risk (RR) &ndash; The relative risk of the disease predisposing alleles. A second relative risk (RR2) is applicable only in Co-dominant model with 2 degrees of freedom (2df).</li>
<li>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) &ndash; The linkage disequilibrium value (in the form of r2 or D&rsquo;) between the causative SNP and the genotyped marker.</li>
<li>Disease prevalence.</li>
<li>Disease allele frequency - the frequency of the disease predisposing allele.</li>
<li>Marker allele frequency &ndash; the allele frequency of the genotyped marker.</li>
<li>Effective degrees of freedom (EDF) - accounts for multiple testing in the study.</li>
<li>Alpha (Type I error).</li>
<li>Control to Case ratio.</li>
<li>Maximum sample size &ndash; the maximum number of cases to be considered in the calculations</li>
<li style="list-style: none;">** The parameter values in the legend of the graph are ordered according to their order in the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong><u>PGA2:</u></strong></p>
<p>PGA2 calculates and plots the minimum detectable relative risk (MDRR) for genotyped markers with different allele frequencies. The user can determine the following parameters:</p>
<ul class="bullet-blu">
<li>Type of genetic variation &ndash; SNP or Haplotype.</li>
<li>Genetic mode of inheritance &ndash; Recessive, Dominant, Co-dominant(1df) or Co-dominant(2df).</li>
<li>Relative risk ratio (RR1/RR2) &ndash; The ratio between the two relative risks of the disease predisposing genetic alleles. This parameter is applicable only in the Co-dominant(2df) model.</li>
<li>Linkage disequilibrium (LD) &ndash; The linkage disequilibrium value (in the form of r2 or D&rsquo;) between the causative SNP and the genotyped marker.</li>
<li>Effective degrees of freedom (EDF) - accounts for multiple testing in the study.</li>
<li>Disease allele frequency - the frequency of the disease predisposing allele.</li>
<li>Case number &ndash; the number of cases in the study.</li>
<li>Control to Case ratio.</li>
<li>Disease prevalence.</li>
<li>Power (1- Type II error).</li>
<li>Alpha (Type I error).</li>
<li>Maximum sample size &ndash; the maximum number of cases to be considered in the calculations.</li>
</ul>
<p>** The parameter values in the legend of the graph are ordered according to their order in the GUI.</p>
<p><strong><u>EDF:</u></strong></p>
<p>EDF calculates the effective degrees of freedom for a particular set of SNP in linkage disequilibrium. It accepts SNP genotype data files from Hapmap (<a href="http://www.hapmap.org/">http://www.hapmap.org</a>)or tab-delimited text files with SNP genotypes (in columns) coded as 0/1/2 for major homozygous, heterozygous and minor homozygous respectively and missing data encoded as NaN. Please see example input files (<a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1500&amp;sys_contentid=410768" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="410768" sys_dependentvariantid="1500" sys_relationshipid="7316217" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1500" sys_contentid="410768">hapmap_example.pdf</a>, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1500&amp;sys_contentid=410767" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="410767" sys_dependentvariantid="1500" sys_relationshipid="7316218" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1500" sys_contentid="410767">genotype_example.pdf</a>). From these data, it computes a summary measure of the EDF (Nyholt et al., 2004) and produces a map of linkage disequilibrium patterns (r2) for the SNPs in the dataset. It allows filtering SNP according to their allele frequencies by determining a threshold of minor allele frequency (MAF).</p>
<p>The resulted EDF value can be incorporated into PGA1 and PGA2 computations.</p>

<p>Telomeres, specialized structures consisting of long DNA nucleotide repeats and a protein complex, are designed to protect the ends of chromosomes and are critical to chromosome stability. Each time a cell divides, the telomeres lose a small amount of DNA and become shorter. Eventually, telomeres become critically short, causing cellular senescence or cellular crisis, which result in apoptosis, genomic instability or a reduction in cellular lifespan. If cells bypass natural processes and continue to divide despite the presence of genomic instability, cancer can develop. DCEG investigators have been studying telomeres and their associations with cancer risk. Types of studies include</p>

<p>DCEG investigators have been studying the causes of familial blood and lymph node cancers for over 30 years. Ongoing advances in genetics, anticipated applications of advanced technologies, and our data from the families we have studied have led us to expand and intensify our research efforts in this area. We are actively recruiting new families to participate in our research. The primary focus of our protocol is on five major areas that together make up a group of diseases called "lymphoproliferative disorders":</p>
<ul>
<li>Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)</li>
<li>Hodgkin lymphoma (HL)</li>
<li>Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL)</li>
<li>Waldenstr&ouml;m's macroglobulinemia (WM)</li>
<li>Multiple myeloma (MM)</li>
</ul>
<p>With certain exceptions, we are studying families who have at least two living members who both have the same lymphoproliferative disorder (for example, a family with two members who both have CLL). The specific goals and methods vary somewhat according to the specific disease under study. The studies may include: completion of detailed medical history questionnaires, review of pertinent medical records and pathology materials, clinical evaluation, and donation of blood and/or cheek cell samples for research. The clinical evaluation includes a medical history and physical examination and may also entail disease-related laboratory or imaging studies. In certain cases, patients may be invited to visit the NIH Warren G. Magnuson Clinical Center in Bethesda, Maryland, for evaluation. Otherwise, study components can often be completed in or near the patient's home community.</p>

<p>Recent experimental and epidemiologic studies of cancers of the breast, colon, rectum, and prostate, as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), suggest that vitamin D metabolites may help prevent cancer or cancer mortality. DCEG investigators undertook the first study to examine the prospective relationship between the vitamin D status metabolite, 25-hydroxyvitamin D in serum and cancer mortality. The study was conducted in more than 15,000 persons aged 17 and older who participated in the third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). It found total cancer mortality was unrelated to baseline vitamin D status in the entire population, including men, women, non-Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans in persons younger than 70 or 70 years or older. Investigators found no interaction between vitamin D and season or vitamin D and serum retinol. Colorectal cancer mortality was inversely related to serum 25(OH)D level.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another study is examining the relationship between two vitamin D metabolites (25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)D and breast cancer in the Prostate, Lung, Colon, and Ovarian (PLCO) screening study cohort.</p>
<p>Investigators are also examining the relationship between pre-diagnostic 25(OH)D and lymphoid cancer risk in a case-control study nested in the Alpha-Tocopherol Beta Carotene Prevention Study cohort of Finnish smokers.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators in the Radiation Epidemiology Branch (REB) have reconstructed radiation dose for radiation technologists included in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=20&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302552" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="302552" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7270624" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="302552">United States Radiologic Technologists (USRT) study</a>. Different sources of data as well as relevant dosimetric models were used in the process, including extensive historical information collected from the literature; more than 1,000,000 film-badge measurements from private laboratories, employers, the military and commercial dosimetric service providers; and detailed work history data. Annual and cumulative occupational badge doses for radiation technologists were reconstructed and used to estimate organ-specific radiation absorbed doses: the thyroid, female breast, ovary, lens of eye, lung, colon, testes, heart, skin, and red bone marrow. The uncertainty of both badge and organ doses for each year of each technologist&rsquo;s working career was characterized using Monte Carlo simulation methods.</p>
<p>Major improvements in the revision included:</p>
<ul>
<li>Increased numbers of annual badge dose measurements</li>
<li>Additional information on individual apron usage</li>
<li>Refined modeling of annual badge dose probability density functions</li>
<li>Refinements in organ dose conversion coefficients to account for uncertainties in machine settings and radiographic techniques</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, investigators found a statistically significant dose response using chromosome aberrations with estimated dose to bone marrow.</p>
<h3>New Initiatives for Improved Occupational Exposure Assessment</h3>
<p>Two new initiatives have been undertaken to improve estimation of occupational radiation doses in radiologic technologists administering radionuclides and those conducting fluoroscopically-guided interventional procedures. Investigators collected historical information on nuclear medicine practices in the 1950s &ndash; 1970s through a focus group meeting with experts to estimate occupational doses for each procedure and radiopharmaceuticals available at that time.</p>
<p>In addition, the fourth survey in the USRT cohort includes two specialized work history modules for the radiologic technologists administering radionuclides and those carrying out fluoroscopically-guided interventional procedures. The survey has been completed and results are being used to refine dose estimates for those technologists.</p>

Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed procedure can be 100 to 500,000 times as efficient (in term of computing time) as the standard resampling-based procedure when evaluating a test statistic with a small p-value (e.g., less than 1e-6 ).</p>

<p>POWER V.3.0.0 has been upgraded to include:</p>
<div class="bullet-blu">
<ul>
<li>Power/sample size for one exposure (binary or categorical with multiple levels)</li>
<li>For two exposures, the specification of a dependent joint probability distribution<br />for exposures</li>
<li>Entry of values for either marginal odds ratios or main effects odds ratios for the specification of the alternative hypothesis</li>
<li>Improved handling of log and output files; and minor bug fixes</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="dceg-top"><a href="#list">Back to Table of Contents</a></div>
<h3 id="I">I. Introduction</h3>
<p>The Power program permits you to determine the power or the sample size for epidemiological studies testing interactions between two factors or testing a null odds ratio or a trend in the odds ratio for a single exposure.</p>
<div class="dceg-top"><a href="#list">Back to Table of Contents</a></div>
<h3 id="II">II. Installation</h3>
<p>To install the Power program run the "install.exe" file. This must be done from Windows, and it is recommended that all Windows programs are closed before doing so. Follow the instructions given to complete the installation.<br />Note: If your computer is running under the Windows 2000 operating system, the install program must be run from an account with installation privileges (i.e., Power User or Administrator). If you are not sure what privileges you have, please contact your System Administrator.</p>
<div class="dceg-top"><a href="#list">Back to Table of Contents</a></div>
<h3 id="III">III. Running the Program</h3>
<p>To launch the Power program, select and run the file Power.exe. This may be done through Explorer or an icon on the desktop or in a program group.</p>
<p>Please note that the calculation engine (PowerCalc.exe) is not intended to be run independently of the interface (Power.exe). The interface facilitates selection of analysis options and it ensures that all parameters are properly specified. It then launches the calculation engine appropriately.</p>
<div class="dceg-top"><a href="#list">Back to Table of Contents</a></div>
<h3 id="IV">IV. Power and Sample Size Calculations</h3>
<p>POWER bases calculations on the prospective binary response model:</p>
<blockquote>P(D|x,y) = [exp(a) X OR(x,y)]^D / [1 + exp(a) X OR(x,y)],</blockquote>
<p>where P(D=1|0,0) = exp(a)/[1 + exp(a)] is the probability of disease at baseline, and where the odds ratio (OR) for joint exposures under the alternative hypothesis may be derived from a multiplicative (i.e., logistic model),</p>
<blockquote>OR (x-x_0,y-y_0) = OR(1,0)^(x-x_0) * OR(0,1)^(y-y_0) * theta^[(x-x_0)(y-y_0)],</blockquote>
<p>or an additive,</p>
<blockquote>OR (x-x_0,y-y_0) = 1 + [OR(1,0)^(x-x_0) - 1 + OR(0,1)^(y-y_0) - 1] *<br />gamma^[(x-x_0)(y-y_0)] relationship.</blockquote>
<p>Power/sample size is based on the OR for interaction (theta) or the excess OR for interaction (gamma), and a test of the null hypothesis theta = 1 (or gamma = 1), when the true theta (or gamma) is a specified value (alternative hypothesis).</p>
<p>For one exposure, the current version of POWER bases calculations on a prospective binary response model, where the odds ratio (or trend in odds ratio with exposure) is linear in the log-odds,</p>
<blockquote>P(D|x) = [exp(a) X OR(x)]^D / [1 + exp(a) X OR(x)] where<br />OR (x-x_0) = OR(1,0)^(x-x_0).</blockquote>
<p>Power/sample size is based on the null hypothesis that OR(x)=1 for all x.</p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is studying families with multiple cases of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), the most common leukemia in adults in the Western Hemisphere. CLL is described as one of the "lymphoproliferative disorders". &nbsp;If CLL runs in your family, NCI invites you and your family to discuss joining our study, in order to help us learn more about this disease.</p>
<h4>Purpose</h4>
<p>The purpose of the study is to:</p>
<div class="bullet-blu">
<ul>
<li>Find the gene or genes that cause this type of leukemia to occur in families.</li>
<li>Describe the clinical features of familial CLL.</li>
<li>Explore whether families prone to familial CLL are also at greater risk of other types of leukemia or cancer.</li>
<li>Identify biomarkers or markers that predict risk in family members.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Who is Eligible?</h4>
<p>To participate, a family must have one of the following:</p>
<div class="bullet-blu">
<ul>
<li>Two or more living individuals in the family with a history of CLL.</li>
<li>Parents, siblings and adult children of affected family members, along with other blood relatives who are genetically linked, may also join.</li>
<li>Spouses of affected family members are welcome to participate if their children (generally aged 35 and over) are participating.</li>
<li>We may consider families in which one family member has CLL, and one or more close relatives have a related blood or lymph cancer such as Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, Hodgkin Lymphoma, or Waldenstr&ouml;m's Macroglobulinemia.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h4>Participating in Research</h4>
<p>Those who join the study will be asked to:</p>
<div class="bullet-blu">
<ul>
<li>Provide a blood sample or cells rinsed from the inside of the cheek for genetic studies.</li>
<li>Provide personal and medical history and family history information.</li>
<li>Give consent to obtain medical records for cancer and related conditions.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Since the genes that increase the risk of this type of familial cancer have not yet been discovered, clinical genetic testing is not part of this study. If our research finds one of these important genes, then interested individuals may be able to have formal genetic testing, either as part of this study or through an additional study.</p>
<p>Some participants will be offered the opportunity to visit the Clinical Center in Bethesda Maryland at no cost to them for more detailed clinical, genetic and laboratory studies aimed at finding other factors that contribute to risk among family members.</p>
<p>Although treatment is not a part of this study, treatment options will be discussed with participants. NCI will provide assistance in establishing care with appropriate physicians as needed. Study participants remain under the care of their primary doctors while participating in this study.</p>
<h4>Continuing Contact</h4>
<p>Participants and families will be asked periodically to complete a follow-up form in order to update medical and family information.</p>
<p>Participants are encouraged to contact the Familial CLL Team with questions or family news.</p>
<p>Information that would change a patient's clinical status, such as the results of routine clinical studies, will be shared with participants.</p>
<h4>Other Details:</h4>
<p><b>Confidentiality&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>NCI is required by Federal Law not to reveal information that is collected from study participants to anyone other than persons directly involved in the study. No personal identifying information will be released or published.</p>
<p>Participants are asked if they would like us to send their health care providers a copy of the clinical findings (physical exam, routine blood work) from their visit to NIH.</p>
<p><b>Costs</b></p>
<p>All study related medical expenses and travel costs to the NIH Clinical Center for participants are paid by NCI.</p>

<p>During the past few decades, there has been dramatic growth in the numbers of higher-dose diagnostic x-ray examinations and fluoroscopically&ndash;guided (FG) procedures. These complex procedures use long and on-time radiological imaging, resulting in high radiation exposure not only to patients but also to physicians. The mortality experience and cumulative radiation exposure level to radiologists, cardiologists and other physicians performing FG procedures are not well known. Although cancer mortality has been studied previously in the U.S. radiologists, this study will update the previous findings and will provide longer term follow-up of radiologists who started practicing more recently who should have been exposed to much lower levels of exposure compared to those radiologists practicing in earlier years. Cancer mortality has not been investigated in the other physicians exposed to radiation from FG procedures. A large cohort of radiologists and other physicians exposed to radiation has been assembled to determine the cause of death compared to physicians who are not exposed to radiation.&nbsp;</p>

<p>CNVfam is a software package for jointly detecting copy number variations (CNV) in nuclear families genotyped using the Illumina platform. CNVfam has the ability to detect both inherited CNVs and de novo CNVs. Compared to algorithms designed for unrelated subjects, CNVfam substantially improves the power of detecting short CNVs carried by multiple family members. CNVfam is computationally very fast, taking less than one minute to analyze a trio and five minutes to analyze a nuclear family with five offsprings.<br /><br />CNVfam detects CNVs in two steps. In the first step, CNVfam infers haplotype sharing pattern at each probe using high quality genotype data. In the second step, CNVfam jointly detects CNVs conditioning on the inferred haplotype sharing pattern by maximizing a penalized likelihood function. Once the haplotype sharing is inferred using SNP genotype data, CNVfam allows the detection of CNVs for subjects with poor intensity data (but with acceptable SNP data).<br /><br />CNVfam is implemented using C++ and currently running in Linux platform. The package has been tested in Illumina 550K, 610K and 660K genotyping platforms. The package includes a readme file and a data example. Please contact Peng.Li2@nih.gov or Jianxin.Shi@nih.gov if you have questions.</p>

<p>The Childhood Cancer Survivor Study (CCSS) was established in the early 1990s as a cohort of more than 14,000 childhood cancer survivors from 26 centers in North America who were originally diagnosed between 1970 and 1986. Investigators from the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=84&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302459" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7124502" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302459" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1422" sys_contentid="302459">Radiation Epidemiology Branch</a> played major roles in CCSS collaborative efforts during the 2000s in case-control studies to quantify the dose-response relationship between radiotherapy exposures and second primary cancers of the thyroid, central nervous system, breast, and sarcomas after childhood cancer. A strong dose-response relationship for glioma and meningioma was noted over a wide range of doses, up to 50 Gy. In addition, risk of thyroid cancer increased through doses of 15 to 20 Gy, but decreased at higher doses. A study of breast cancer among members of the cohort indicated an association with chest irradiation and a personal or family history of bone or soft tissue sarcoma. In the last 10 years, CCSS has broadened to include a similar number of survivors diagnosed between 1987 and 1999, and expanded to include patients from additional centers.</p>
<p>In 2011, DCEG initiated a collaboration with CCSS to conduct a <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=1057944" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7124503" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_dependentid="1057944" rxinlineslot="103" sys_variantid="1418" sys_contentid="1057944">genome-wide association study</a> (GWAS) aimed at identifying genetic variants associated with 1) development of second cancers (either independent of treatment exposures or jointly with specific treatments), 2) development of childhood cancer, and 3) development of non-malignant late adverse effects of treatment (e.g., cardiomyopathy, obesity, ototoxicity). The GWAS includes over 5700 survivors. Analyses for aims 1-2 are ongoing, and the data are being posted to the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap">database of Genotypes and Phenotypes</a> (dbGaP) to facilitate analyses related to aim 3. <a href="https://ccss.stjude.org/develop-a-study/gwas-data-resource.html">Find out more about the CCSS GWAS data resource</a>.</p>
<p>DCEG and CCSS investigators are now conducting whole exome sequencing of the cohort to identify other types of genetic variants (e.g., rare variants, multi-allelic substitutions, insertions, and deletions) that may be related to the development of childhood cancer and late effects following childhood cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>REB and CCSS investigators are also collaborating on a case-control study of breast cancer occurring after childhood cancer. Previous studies have shown that chest radiotherapy for childhood cancer confers strikingly elevated risk for developing subsequent breast cancer. The current study aims to understand whether the radiation-related risks are modified by other key risk factors and if the risks are consistent for all types of breast cancer, which has important implications both for understanding breast cancer etiology as well as for decision-making for long-term follow-up of childhood cancer survivors.</p>

<p>A multi-center U.S. case-control study of benign and malignant brain tumors is addressing a variety of possible risk factors for these poorly understood tumors. Analyses did not indicate associations with use of cellular telephones, which emit radiofrequency radiation, nor with exposure to low-frequency electromagnetic fields (EMF) from electrical appliances used in the home. Employment in several occupations was associated with these tumors. These observations are being followed in detailed studies of the possible role of specific exposures, including solvents, lead, pesticides and EMF. One of these suggested a gene-environment interaction involving occupational exposure to lead and risk of meningioma that depended on a polymorphism in the gene (<i>ALAD</i>) that&nbsp;influences the toxicokinetics of lead.</p>
<p>Investigators did not observe associations between glioma or meningioma and occupational exposure to insecticides or herbicides. Additional occupational exposures can be evaluated in this study. No association was seen for use of hair dyes, which contain aromatic amines. A significant inverse association between the risk of glioma and history of allergies or autoimmune diseases was observed, as well as a positive association of glioma with age at menarche and an inverse association with age at first live birth. Studies of self-reported family history and brain tumor risk indicated increased risk of glioma in persons with a first degree relative with stomach cancer, prostate cancer or Hodgkin lymphoma. DNA, serum and plasma samples are available for future studies.</p>

<h2>Cancer incidence among children undergoing computed tomography (CT) scans</h2>
<p>Due to the lack of empirical data on CT use and cancer, DCEG has initiated a retrospective cohort study with the University of Newcastle to evaluate the relationship between radiation exposure from CT scans conducted during childhood and adolescence and the subsequent development of cancer. We currently are identifying a cohort of 200,000 people who received CT scans as children or adolescents in the UK during 1985-2002. The cohort will be followed for cancer incidence and mortality using national records. We also are assessing trends in use of CT examinations in various parts of the UK.</p>
<p>In addition, two studies of CT examinations were conducted in Israel. In a descriptive study of pediatric and adolescent CT scan use during 1999-2003 in a large health maintenance organization in Israel we found that the cranium was the most frequently scanned region of the body, ranging from 78% in young children to 39% in adolescents. The highest annual CT examination rate (per 1,000) was recorded in 2001 (10.1) compared to 7.0 and 6.3 in 1999 and 2003, respectively. The lowest rate (three scans per 1,000) was found for 3-year-old children, with increasing rates with age. In the second study, we estimated that 17,686 pediatric scans were conducted annually in Israel during 1999-2003. We projected that 9.5 lifetime deaths would be associated with 1 year of pediatric CT scanning. This number represents an excess of 0.29% over the total number of patients who are eventually estimated to die from cancer in their lifetime.</p>

<p>CompareTests is an R package to estimate agreement and diagnostic accuracy statistics for two diagnostic tests when one is conducted on only a subsample of specimens. A standard test is observed on all specimens. We treat the second test (or sampled test) as being conducted on only a stratified sample of specimens. We treat the total sample as stratified two-phase sampling and use inverse probability weighting. We estimate diagnostic accuracy (category-specific classification probabilities; for binary tests reduces to specificity and sensitivity, and also predictive values) and agreement statistics (percent agreement, percent agreement by category, Kappa (unweighted), and symmetry tests (reduces to McNemar's test for binary tests)).</p>

<p>The Colon Cancer Risk Assessment-Gauss Program is an executable file that projects absolute colon cancer risk according to <a href="https://ccrisktool.cancer.gov/">NCI&rsquo;s Colorectal Cancer Risk Assessment Tool</a> (CCRAT) algorithm in the batch mode. It also computes 95% confidence intervals for the risk projections.</p>
<p>Users can enter risk factor data and projection interval ages for a group of men or women, and the program will return the corresponding absolute risk projections. This program may be useful for research purposes when one needs risk projections for an entire study population. The program can be run on either a 32-bit or a 64-bit system. To find a program in SAS to compute absolute risk projections (without confidence intervals), please see the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1418&amp;sys_contentid=302539" sys_contentid="302539" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="302539" sys_dependentvariantid="1418" sys_relationshipid="7317663" sys_siteid="475" sys_variantid="1418">Colon Cancer Risk Assessment - SAS Macro</a> page.</p>

<p>Researchers in the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) investigate the causes of cancer at the population level. Together with their trainees, our experts pair genetic and genomic studies of common and rare malignancies with classical epidemiological approaches. We utilize cutting-edge technology for large-scale processing of biological samples that yield data rich with clues to etiologic patterns. Families with rare inherited cancer syndromes, such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome, participate in DCEG clinical studies. Their contributions to research allow us to advance our understanding of genetic and modifiable factors in disease risk, and to generate cancer screening or prevention techniques for these unique populations.</p>

<h2 class="firstli">Closed to Patient Enrollment, Data Analysis Ongoing</h2>
<p class="firstli">DCEG has been studying the Hereditary Breast/Ovarian Cancer (HBOC) syndrome since the 1960s; it now comprises a genetic disease paradigm for addressing vital translational clinical cancer genetics research questions. Resources include a prospective cohort of 32 <i>BRCA</i> mutation-positive families with extensive clinical and epidemiologic information, as well as biological samples. One hundred fifty new mutation-positive families have enrolled during the past several years. <b>This study is now closed to new patient enrollment. Patient- related clinical activities have ended.</b> Our focus will be on analyzing previously-collected data.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=42&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302430" sys_contentid="302430" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1422" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7270629" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302430" rxinlineslot="103">Clinical Genetics Branch</a> (CGB) HBOC family cohort was part of the original international collaborative research effort coordinated by the Breast Cancer Linkage Consortium that contributed to the mapping and cloning of <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i>. More recent research highlights include documenting a 62% reduction in breast cancer risk among women undergoing risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy in a prospective cohort of <i>BRCA</i> mutation-positive families, a series of counseling/psychosocial reports of our early experience with HBOC families undergoing genetic risk assessment, and definitive-negative candidate gene studies analyzing genetic modifiers of <i>BRCA1/2</i>-related breast cancer risk as part of the Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of <i>BRCA1/2</i> ("CIMBA") project, and. The most noteworthy CIMBA-related findings include confirmation that <i>RAD51</i> significantly modifies the risk of <i>BRCA2</i>-related breast cancer, and that <i>FGFR2</i> and <i>TNRC9</i> (modifiers of sporadic breast cancer risk that were identified through the analysis of unselected breast cancer cases) also play important roles in the risk of <i>BRCA</i>-related breast cancer.</p>
<p>We plan additional clinical, genetic, behavioral and translational research studies of the cohort of DCEG hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) families. In those families in which we have documented disease-related mutations in <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i>, the initial effort will be focused on providing genetic risk assessment, pre-test counseling and clinical germline mutation testing for those members of the CGB cohort of HBOC families who have been long-term participants in DCEG studies over the past 30 years. The members of these families have been invited to participate in other CGB protocols, including the Breast Imaging/Breast Duct Lavage study, the National Ovarian Cancer Prevention and Early Detection study, and a Phase I PARP-inhibitor trial targeting women at increased genetic risk of ovarian cancer being run by investigators in NCI's Center for Cancer Research (CCR). We have also collaborated with CCR's breast cancer Phase II chemoprevention trials of raloxifene and exemestane, and its pilot study of increasing physical activity as a breast cancer risk-reduction strategy.</p>
<p>DNA collected from these families is being contributed to an international collaboration seeking genetic modifiers of <i>BRCA1</i> and <i>BRCA2</i> penetrance, using both the candidate gene and genome-wide association study (GWAS) research strategies. Our <i>BRCA</i> mutation-negative families are being used to evaluate new candidate breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility genes. These families are also eligible to participate in various ancillary studies evaluating behavioral and psychosocial aspects of being at increased genetic risk of breast and ovarian cancer. We are currently analyzing the prospective risk of breast cancer among <i>BRCA</i> mutation-negative members of mutation-positive families, after an average of 18 years of follow-up. This is one of the very few long-term prospective studies of cancer risk in families with known <i>BRCA</i> mutations.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This package is for subset-based association analysis of heterogeneous but possibly related traits.</p>
<h3>Details</h3>
<p>ASSET is a suite of statistical tools specifically designed to be powerful for pooling association signals across multiple studies when true effects may exist only in a subset of the studies and could be in opposite directions across studies. The method explores all possible subsets (or a restricted set if user specifies so) of studies and evaluates fixed-effect meta-analysis-type test-statistics for each subset. The final test-statistic is obtained by maximizing the subset-specific test-statistics over all possible subsets and then evaluating its significance after efficient adjustment for multiple-testing, taking into account the correlation between test-statistics across different subsets due to overlapping subjects. The method not only returns a p-value for significance for the overall evidence of association of a SNP across studies, but also outputs the "best subset" containing the studies that contributed to the overall association signal. For detection of association signals with effects in opposite directions, ASSET allows subset search separately for positively- and negatively- associated studies and then combines association signals from two directions using a chi-square test-statistic. The method can take into account correlation due to overlapping subjects across studies (e.g. shared controls). Although the method is originally developed for conducting genetic association scans, it can also be applied for analysis of non-genetic risk factors as well.</p>

<p>DCEG research has identified that red and processed meats are associated with an increased risk of several cancers, while poultry and fish intake may be protective. Investigators are currently studying carcinogenic compounds formed in meat during processing or cooking, such as:</p>
<ul class="bullet-blu">
<li>Heterocyclic amines</li>
<li><i>N</i>-nitroso compounds</li>
<li>Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</li>
</ul>
<p>DCEG investigators have developed a variety of specialized questionnaires and databases to help study nutritional aspects of cancer causation such as diet and physical activity. Measuring exposures to carcinogenic compounds requires different kinds of measurements. To accommodate this need, investigators are performing studies on the metabolism and excretion of these compounds, analyzing their metabolites to help identify biomarkers that we can use to measure internal exposures.</p>

<p>Waldenstr&ouml;m's macroglobulinemia (WM) is a rare type of tumor that belongs to a group of disorders called lymphoproliferative diseases. It occurs in approximately 1100 people/year in the U.S. Although WM can occur in people of both sexes and any race, the majority of patients are white males. The cause of WM is unknown. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) is conducting a study to obtain clinical information about WM and to determine what causes WM to sometimes develop in two or more family members.</p>
<h4>Definition of Familial WM</h4>
<p>Most people who have WM are the only member of their family with this condition. Sometimes, however, WM occurs in two or more blood relatives; the affected family members are said to have familial WM. The reasons why WM may run in families are unknown. It might be that the affected family members shared a susceptibility to WM, or they may have been exposed to similar environmental factors. At the present time, little is known about either host factors or environmental exposures that might be associated with WM. We want to study families in which two or more blood relatives have developed WM because they might provide important clues about what causes WM in the general population.</p>
<h4>Our Study</h4>
<p>We are especially interested in persons from families with 2 or more members affected with WM. Persons who were diagnosed with WM at an early age (less than 35 years old) are of interest to us even if no one else in their family has WM.</p>
<p>If you participate in our study, we would ask you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Complete a questionnaire that asks about your family's structure and medical history and about certain factors that may be important in causing WM.</li>
<li>Give us permission to obtain medical records documenting cancer&nbsp;diagnosis in the affected family members.</li>
<li>Allow us to obtain blood and/or saliva samples from both affected and unaffected family members for a variety of laboratory studies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some study participants may be invited to the NIH for clinical and other studies. All information obtained from our study would remain confidential to the extent permitted by law, and participation in any part of it is voluntary.</p>
<p>If you are interested in more information about the study, please contact Stephanie Steinbart, our Cancer Genetics Referral Nurse, at 1-800-518-8474, or e-mail her at <a href="mailto:stephaniesteinbart@westat.com">stephaniesteinbart@westat.com</a>.</p>

<h3 id="Overview">Overview</h3>
<p>Clinical cancer genetics research aims to understand cancer etiology and to translate this knowledge into evidence-based management strategies for persons at increased risk of cancer. Investigators work to identify new cancer susceptibility genes and factors contributing to elevated cancer risk in individuals and populations. They also characterize phenotypic manifestations of inherited cancer syndromes and study the psychological and social challenges related to being at high risk of cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fellows in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=42&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=475&amp;sys_variantid=1422&amp;sys_contentid=302430" sys_contentid="302430" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1422" sys_dependentvariantid="1422" sys_dependentid="302430" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="475" sys_relationshipid="7294810">Clinical Genetics Branch</a> work with researchers engaged in conducting clinical research studies targeting high-risk individuals and families, in pursuing astute clinical observations of unusual cancer occurrences, and in applying genomic and epidemiologic methods to the study of high-risk individuals. They gain practical knowledge about conducting clinical studies and learn about basic molecular laboratory techniques and approaches. Fellows work on interdisciplinary epidemiologic, genomic, and translational studies. These are not primary laboratory-based positions. Instead, they involve extensive collaboration with core facilities and laboratory collaborators. Postdoctoral and predoctoral positions in CGB are available and applications are accepted on a continuous basis.</p>

<p>Diets containing substantial amounts of red meat may increase the risk of various types of cancer. The association with red meat intake may be due to a combination of factors, such as content of fat, protein, and iron, and/or meat preparation (e.g. cooking or preserving methods). Experimental studies have shown that meats cooked at high temperatures contain heterocyclic amines (HCAs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are mutagenic and carcinogenic in animals. To estimate intake of these meat-cooking mutagens, a detailed meat cooking module within a Food Frequency Questionnaire in conjunction with a mutagen database was developed. Charred is a software application to estimate intake of the mutagenic compounds in cooked meats.</p>

<h3>In Remembrance of Arthur Schatzkin, M.D., Dr.P.H., 1948 - 2011</h3>
<p><img width="150" height="194" style="float: left; margin: 5px 10px 5px 0;" alt=" Arthur Schatzkin, M.D., Dr.P.H." src="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1482&amp;sys_contentid=303093" inlinetype="rximage" sys_relationshipid="7251743" sys_dependentvariantid="1482" sys_dependentid="303093" rxinlineslot="104" />Dr. Arthur Schatzkin, an outstanding scientist, mentor, and leader in the field of nutritional epidemiology, passed away on January 20, 2011 from cancer. An internationally renowned pioneer in the field of nutrition and cancer and a gifted public speaker, he was a man of great personal and professional integrity who cared deeply about the impact of his work on public health.</p>
<p>Dr. Schatzkin received a B.A. from Yale University, an M.D. from the State University of New York, and an M.P.H. and Dr.P.H. from Columbia University. He came to NCI in 1984, and in 1999 was appointed as the Chief of the Nutritional Epidemiology Branch (NEB) in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG).</p>
<p>Dr. Schatzkin was committed to understanding the role of nutrition in cancer etiology and prevention. Early in his career, he was the first to describe an association between moderate alcohol intake and breast cancer risk. He then turned his attention to the role of diet in the prevention of colorectal cancer. He led the landmark NCI Polyp Prevention Trial, which determined that eating fiber did not prevent the recurrence of polyps in the colon.</p>
<p>Dr. Schatzkin was instrumental in addressing the major methodological issues that have limited progress in nutritional epidemiology. As an example, to overcome the limited range of reported dietary intake in cohort studies, he conceived and launched the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study, which at the time was the largest prospective cohort investigation of diet and nutrition in relation to cancer causation. This long-term study of approximately 500,000 men and women already has generated more than 100 original scientific papers and continues to be an invaluable resource utilized by investigators worldwide.</p>
<p>Dr. Schatzkin was dedicated to the pursuit of strategies in nutritional epidemiology and to the training, mentoring, and support of young scientists. During his tenure as Branch Chief, NEB grew from two investigators to a highly productive team of more than 20 scientists.</p>
<p>Dr. Schatzkin was at the forefront of efforts to meet the challenges of research in nutritional epidemiology. By developing new methods to assess the components of nutritional status, he provided strong leadership that inspired creativity and passion in trainees and senior scientists alike. His great personal warmth, intellectual curiosity, and genuine commitment to improve public health through exemplary science will be greatly missed.</p>

It is designed to give the users flexibility of using a number of different methods for analysis of SNP-environment or SNP-SNP interactions. It is known that power of interaction analysis in case-control studies can be greatly enhanced if it can be assumed that the factors (e.g. two SNPs) under study are independently distributed in the underlying population. The package implements a number of different methods that can incorporate such independence constraints into analysis of interactions in the setting of both unmatched and matched case-control studies. These methods are more general and flexible than the popular case-only method of analysis of interaction that also assumes gene-gene or/and gene-environment independence for the underlying factors in the underlying population. The package also implements various methods, based on shrinkage estimation and conditional-likelihoods, that can automatically adjust for possible violation of the independence assumption that could arise due to direct causal relationship (e.g. between a gene and a behavior exposure) or indirect correlation (e.g due to population stratification). A number of convenient summary and printing functions are included. The package will continue to be updated with new methods as they are developed. The methods are currently not suitable for analysis of SNPs on sex chromosomes.</p><h3>Details</h3><p>The main functions for unmatched data are snp.logistic and snp.scan.logistic. Whereas snp.logistic analyzes one SNP with each function call, snp.scan.logistic analyzes a collection of SNPs and writes the summary results to an external file. With snp.logistic, a data frame is input in which the SNP variable must be coded as 0-1-2 (or 0-1). If not, recode.geno can be used for recoding the SNP variable before calling snp.logistic. The functions getSummary, getWaldTest and snp.effects can be called for creating summary tables, computing Wald tests and joint/stratified effects using the returned object from snp.logistic (see Examples in snp.logistic). With snp.scan.logistic, the data is read in from external files defined in snp.list and pheno.list. The collection of p-values computed in snp.scan.logistic, can be plotted using the functions QQ.plot and chromosome.plot.<br /><br />The function for analysis of matched case-control data is snp.matched. Optimal matching can be obtained from the function getMatchedSets.<br /><br />This package contains sample genotype data SNPdata, sample covariate data Xdata, and sample SNP meta data LocusMapData. The current version of the packag is only suitable for analysis of SNPs on non-sex chromosomes.<br />&#160;</p><h3>Author(s):</h3>Samsiddhi Bhattacharjee, Nilanjan Chatterjee and William Wheeler<br /><h3>References:</h3><h3>Maximum-likelihood estimation under independence:</h3>Chatterjee, N. and Carroll, R.

<p>It is estimated that more than 16 million cancer survivors are currently alive in the United States, which has led to an increasing focus on the long-term outcome of cancer treatment. DCEG has a long-standing interest in cancer survivorship research, particularly the role of radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal treatments in second cancer risk. DCEG investigators monitor NCI&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer registry database to assess patterns and trends in the occurrence of second primary cancers. The overall objective is to identify cancer survivors who appear to be at increased risk for developing second primary cancers. These survivors can then be targeted for increased surveillance and primary and secondary prevention strategies, as well as identifying areas that require additional analytic study.</p>
<p>To facilitate research into the etiology of second cancers, investigators from DCEG's Radiation Epidemiology Branch led the development of an interactive PC-based software module (&ldquo;SIR&rdquo;) to perform analyses of multiple primary cancers using NCI&rsquo;s SEER database. The analysis module was added to the SEER*Stat program, a publicly available software package created by NCI that calculates SEER incidence, mortality, and survival rates (<a href="http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/">http://seer.cancer.gov/seerstat/</a>). The multiple primary cancer module calculates standardized incidence ratios by second cancer site, histology, treatment, sex, race, calendar year, age, time since diagnosis, and registry. DCEG researchers have used this software tool to evaluate the risk of second cancers in SEER among survivors of a number of malignancies, including breast cancer, childhood cancer, and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Occupational exposure to electromagnetic fields (EMF) has been linked with brain tumors based on job titles and industry. A multi-center U.S. case-control study of benign and malignant brain tumors investigated occupational exposure to EMF using a detailed, rigorous assessment strategy to improve exposure assessment for EMF, in conjunction with industrial hygienists in DCEG. Four exposure metrics were evaluated: (1) maximum exposed job; (2) total years of exposure &gt; 1.5 mG; (3) cumulative lifetime exposure; and (4) average lifetime exposure. No statistically significant elevation in odds ratios or trends in odds ratios across exposure categories were seen for glioma or meningioma.</p>

<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This function uses the effect sizes for a set of known susceptibility SNPs and the power of detection of these SNPs from the original discovery samples to obtain an estimate of the total number of underlying susceptibility SNP for that trait and the distribution of their effect sizes. The function can further use the estimated number of loci and distribution of effect sizes to evaluate the power for discovery of a future GWAS study (up to three-stage).</p>

<p>DCEG investigators are studying risk of anal cancer in HIV-positive men who have sex with men. They have established a cohort of 370 HIV-positive men through the Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC) health maintenance program. Under written, informed consent, participating KPNC members responded to a self-administered risk factor questionnaire and underwent two anal specimen collections, using liquid-based cytology (LBC) medium, as well as a digital exam and high resolution anoscopy. Participants were followed annually for two years to collect follow-up clinical data related to outcomes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Baseline clinician-collected specimens were tested in a masked fashion for the following clinical biomarkers: 1) carcinogenic HPV DNA in aggregate and individual carcinogenic HPV genotypes; 2) carcinogenic HPV RNA and HPV16/18 RNA; 3) p16INK4a and Ki-67 immunocytochemical staining. For reference, clinician-collected specimens are being used to make LBC slides and for evaluation by an expert cytopathology laboratory. Investigators are estimating the HPV genotype-specific risk and the clinical performance (sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and referral rates) of individual tests and combinations of tests for detection of prevalently-detected, one-year cumulative, and two-year cumulative histologically-confirmed anal precancer (anal intraepithelial neoplasia grade 3) or worse (=AIN3).</p>

<p>To better understand the etiology of rare cancers that form in the biliary tract (bile duct, gallbladder, ampulla of Vater), DCEG researchers are conducting studies to examine the molecular and epidemiologic characteristics of cancer at different sites in the biliary tract and identify potential molecular subtypes. Tumor and other biologic samples are compiled from various efforts in China and Chile, where incidence of these cancers is higher than in the United States.</p>
<p>As more samples and accompanying exposure information are collected, investigators are able to study increasingly rare subtypes with cutting-edge techniques to determine the epidemiologic and molecular contributors to the development of biliary tract cancers. A better understanding of the molecular differences across these malignancies can lead to more precise diagnosis and effective treatment, as well as provide clues as to etiology.</p>
<p>Studies include:</p>
<h2>Chile Biliary Longitudinal Study (Chile BiLS)</h2>
<p>The Chile Biliary Longitudinal Study (Chile BiLS) is a cohort of women diagnosed with gallstones in an area of Chile with high risk for gallbladder cancer. The purpose of this study is to explore the etiology and natural history of gallbladder dysplasia and biliary cancer, identify potential non-invasive risk stratification methods, such as inflammatory markers, and develop strategies for prevention.</p>
<h2>Biliary Tract Cancer Pooling Project (BiTCaPP)</h2>
<p>The Biliary Tract Cancer Pooling Project (BiTCaPP) is an international study involving 28 cohorts with over 4,500 biliary tract cancer cases from over 2.8 million participants. This resource allows for the prospective evaluation of risk factors. BiTCaPP is the first effort of its kind for the joint evaluation of cancers throughout the biliary tract and offers great promise for a more definitive understanding of the etiology of cancer across the entire biliary tract.</p>
<h2>Cholecystectomy Risk Stratification (CRS) Study</h2>
<p>The Cholecystectomy Risk Stratification (CRS) Study is a cross-sectional study of 1645 cholecystectomy patients with pre-surgery blood recruited from hospital wards in Chile. This study allows the evaluation of circulating blood markers to assess their potential for risk stratification. Current work is focused on circulating inflammatory markers.</p>
<h2>Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study</h2>
<p>The Shanghai Biliary Tract Cancer Study is a case-control study conducted in China, including 627 BTC cases, 1,037 patients with biliary stones, and 959 population-based controls. This study allows cross-sectional evaluation of biologic markers and epidemiologic risk factors for gallbladder, extrahepatic bile duct, and ampulla of Vater cancer.</p>

<p>DCEG conducted a large interdisciplinary case-control study of bladder cancer (1,200 cases and 1,200 controls) in 18 hospitals from five different regions in Spain. This effort was a collaboration between investigators in DCEG's Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch (OEEB) and investigators from the Centre for Research in Environmental Epidemiology (CREAL) in Barcelona and Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO) in Madrid, Spain. A computer-aided personal interview (CAPI) system was developed to collect detailed information on tobacco use (black or blond), occupational and environmental exposures, medical history and drug use, family history and diet. Blood collection and processing allowed for testing for genetic susceptibility markers such as <i>CYP1A1</i>, <i>NAT1</i>, <i>NAT2</i>, <i>GSTM1</i>, DNA repair capacity, and mutagen sensitivity.</p>

<p>Osteosarcoma, the most common primary bone tumor, occurs most frequently in adolescents, but there is a second incidence peak among individuals aged 60 and older. Most osteosarcoma epidemiology studies have been embedded in large analyses of bone tumors in general, all histologic subtypes combined, or focused on cases occurring in adolescence. Detailed descriptions of osteosarcoma incidence and survival in particular, with direct comparisons among patients of all ages and ethnicities, are not available. Investigators in DCEG have completed and published several analyses of cancer registry data from the National Cancer Institute's population-based Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program from U.S. (SEER) and international cancer registries, to more fully characterize the descriptive epidemiology of osteosarcoma.</p>
<p>From NCI/SEER, investigators identified frequency, incidence, and survival rates for 3,482 patients with osteosarcoma diagnosed between 1973 and 2004. They described these cases by age, race, sex, pathology subtype, stage, and anatomic site. There were large differences in incidence and survival rates by age. There was a high percentage of osteosarcoma with Paget disease and osteosarcoma as a second or later cancer among the elderly. Tumor site differences among age groups were noted. Survival rates varied by anatomic site and disease stage, and did not improve significantly from 1984 to 2004. In this comprehensive, population-based description of osteosarcoma, investigators identified important differences in incidence, survival, pathologic subtype, and anatomic site among age groups, and quantified the impact of osteosarcoma in patients with Paget disease or as a second cancer on incidence and mortality rates. These findings may have implications in understanding osteosarcoma biology and epidemiology.</p>
<p>The international patterns of osteosarcoma incidence in children have been described, whereas those for young, middle age or elderly adults have not. Using the Cancer Incidence in Five Continents, International Agency for Cancer Research database,&nbsp;DCEG investigators compared incidence rates for children and adolescents (age 0-24 years), the middle age group (25-59 years) and elderly (&gt; or = 60 years) persons by world regions and individual countries. Overall, worldwide osteosarcoma incidence rates were quite similar in the younger age groups. The greatest variation in incidence rates was observed in the elderly.</p>

<h2>A Case-Control Study of Osteosarcoma</h2>
<p>As part of a case-control study of osteosarcoma&nbsp;initiated in 1995 between the NCI and the Harvard Dental School (the Bone Disease and Injury Study of Osteosarcoma [BDISO]), DCEG investigators have studied genetic variation in many genes potentially important in growth pathways. They identified a small haplotype block that was associated with two-fold increase in risk of&nbsp;osteosarcoma in the <i>IGF2R</i> gene. This region (around exon 16) consisted of CpG islands, and functional analysis of the SNPs in this block suggested that a SNP associated with&nbsp;osteosarcoma risk results in differential methylation at that SNP site.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Although most cases of&nbsp;osteosarcoma are sporadic, it is also a prototypic syndrome-related malignancy in the Li-Fraumeni syndrome; germline <i>TP53</i> mutations are the primary genetic basis for this rare disorder. Therefore, we investigated the role of germline genetic variation in <i>TP53</i> as risk factors for sporadic osteosarcoma. Although our data did not indicate a strong link between variation in <i>TP53</i> and&nbsp;osteosarcoma risk, they did provide preliminary evidence suggesting an increased risk of&nbsp;osteosarcoma associated with <i>TP53</i> variants IVS2+38 and Pro72Arg. While this was a small study, genetic variation across the <i>TP53</i> gene was thoroughly investigated. Genetic variants in telomere maintenance genes are the focus of ongoing analysis. Preliminary data suggest a possible protective effect associated with specific variants in several different telomere pathway genes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A formal meta-analysis of this plus other published osteosarcoma case-control studies is now underway, under the leadership of&nbsp;DCEG investigators. It will focus on a pooled analysis of birth weight, birth length and height as&nbsp;osteosarcoma risk factors.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a follow-up to these pilot observations, subjects from the BDISO case-control study were genotyped as part of DCEG's Rare Cancer iSelect project. Comprehensive analysis of more than 25,000 variants in several hundred carcinogenesis-related candidate genes and pathways is being conducted. Increased statistical power will be achieved through pooling of control subjects obtained from other DCEG studies, after careful correction for population stratification. Analysis of these data is currently underway.</p>

<h2>Closed to Patient Enrollment, Data Analysis Ongoing</h2>
<p>Women who are at high genetic risk of cancer because they have a mutation in one of the BReast CAncer susceptibility genes, <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i>, are at increased risk of developing breast cancer. Many high-risk women develop breast cancer before the age of 50. For these women, cancer risk is managed through vigilant surveillance, in hopes of identifying the disease at an early stage. The Breast Imaging Study evaluated the use of several new, promising breast cancer screening techniques in women at high genetic risk of breast cancer. These techniques include magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and breast duct lavage (BDL) and/or nipple aspiration. This study has completed accrual and follow-up. Investigators found no differences in mammographic density between <i>BRCA</i> mutation carriers and non-carriers, and demonstrated that breast duct lavage is an unsatisfactory clinical procedure. Data from this cohort led to the development of a novel breast MRI imaging phantom and has been used to identify novel breast imaging features (e.g., &ldquo;texture&rdquo;) which may permit discrimination between mutation-negative and mutation-positive women.</p>

<p>The Columbia, Missouri serum bank was established as part of the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Biological Markers Project to identify serum markers for breast cancer. A total of 7,224 women living in and around Columbia, MO who were free of cancer other than non-melanoma skin cancer, donated blood to the serum bank on one or more occasions between 1977 and 1987. Approximately 25% of the women were premenopausal. At the time of each blood collection, interview information was obtained from participants on the major known breast cancer risk factors including age, height, weight, reproductive and menstrual histories, family history of breast cancer, medical conditions, and drug use, including oral contraceptives and menopausal hormone therapy. Date of last menstrual period was obtained for women who were premenopausal at the time of each blood collection. Approximately 30% of the women donated multiple samples over the first 10 years of the study, including 20% who had 3 or more samples, with collections occurring on average one year apart. In 1989, the first follow-up ascertained 107 breast cancers among women who were cancer-free at blood collection. A subset of these breast cancers was included in a number of biomarker studies, including the measurement of sex steroid hormones, carotenoids, alpha-tocopherol, selenium, organochlorine pesticides and PCBs. A more recent follow-up was completed in 2002, at which time an additional 279 breast cancers were identified.</p>
<p>Using the expanded group of breast cancer cases in the Columbia, MO Serum Bank Follow-up Study, additional biomarker studies have been conducted, including how adipokines relate to breast cancer risk factors. These analyses showed lower levels of adiponectin and higher levels of absolute plasminogen activator inhibitor (aPAI-1) were associated with increasing body mass index, but not with breast cancer risk. In more recently completed analyses, a newly developed tandem mass spectrometry assay was used to measure a panel of 15 estrogens and estrogen metabolites in relation to postmenopausal breast cancer risk. This showed that both a higher ratio of the 2/16 hydroxylation pathway and of the ratios of 2- or 4- hydroxylation were associated with reduced breast cancer risk. These findings support that analyses of metabolic pathways may help elucidate the role of estrogen metabolism in breast carcinogenesis.</p>

<p>The Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project Follow-up Study involves approximately 64,000 women who were participants in the Breast Cancer Detection Demonstration Project, a 5-year screening program conducted between 1973 and 1980 at 29 centers throughout the United States. The follow-up study began in 1980 and follow-up continued through 2005. Information on cancer diagnoses, benign breast procedures, and exposure to established and hypothesized cancer risk factors has been ascertained through questionnaires administered over the course of the follow-up study. Researchers are analyzing exogenous hormones, lifestyle factors, and other risk factors for breast, ovarian, endometrial, and colorectal cancers.</p>

<p>Terminal duct lobular units (TDLUs)&mdash;also referred to as lobules&mdash;are epithelial structures within the breast that produce milk during lactation; they are also the primary anatomical source of most breast cancer precursors and cancers. With completion of childbearing and physiological aging, TDLUs involute (shrink), resulting in a reduction in the number of acini (epithelial substructures) per TDLU and total TDLU counts. Delayed age-appropriate TDLU involution could be associated with increased breast cancer risk because of a higher amount of &ldquo;at-risk&rdquo; epithelium.&nbsp;</p>

<p>We are conducting molecular epidemiologic studies of TDLU involution, which could provide insights into early carcinogenic events. We are performing these studies&nbsp;in collaboration with the Susan G. Komen&reg; Tissue Bank at the Indiana University Simon Cancer Center (KTB)&mdash;a unique resource of normal breast tissues, questionnaire data, saliva, and blood donated by volunteers for use in research. Quantitative measures of TDLU involution have been annotated on 1938 women ages 18-74 from this repository without any evidence of breast cancer. The aims of this study are to assess how breast cancer risk factors relate to TDLU involution, which could clarify the natural history of the disease and could lead to novel strategies for risk assessment, early detection and prevention.</p>

<p>This population-based case-control study was conducted from 2000-2003 in two major cities in Poland, Warsaw and Lodz, and enrolled 2,386 breast cancer cases and 2,798 age and site matched controls. The study utilized state-of-the art exposure assessment techniques, including detailed personal interviews, anthropometric measurements, physical activity monitors, and collection of dust samples from the participants&rsquo; homes. In order to facilitate study of a wide range of biomarkers, biological specimen collection included blood samples processed as cryopreserved whole blood, serum+ blood clot, plasma+buffy coat+red blood cells; 12-hour overnight urine; paraffin-embedded tumor and normal tissue; and fresh tissue from tumors, non-neoplastic breast tissue, and mammary fat tissue.</p>
<p>Investigators in DCEG obtained ten-year follow-up information from medical records for approximately 1,300 breast cancer cases recruited in Warsaw and 300 cases recruited in Lodz, as well as mortality data on most cases in the study using the Cancer Registry and Death Certificate Office database in Poland. The main research projects being conducted include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyses of questionnaire-based factors and anthropometric/physical activity measurements in relation to cancer risk and clinical outcomes;</li>
<li>Identifying genetic susceptibility markers of cancer risk and clinical outcomes using candidate gene and genome-wide association (GWAS) approaches;</li>
<li>Analyses of breast tissue/tumor markers to evaluate relationships with cancer risk factors (known or suspected), and their impact on predicting recurrence and survival after diagnosis;</li>

<p>Investigators in DCEG are currently collaborating with colleagues in NCI&rsquo;s Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium at the University of Vermont, the University of California at San Francisco, and in NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences, on the Breast Radiology Evaluation and Study of Tissues (or &ldquo;BREAST&rdquo;) Stamp Project. A total of 466 women ages 40-65 years who were clinically referred to radiologically-guided breast biopsy were enrolled from fall 2007 through summer 2010. The BREAST Stamp Project aims to characterize the radiologic, histologic, molecular, and biochemical features of dense breast tissue and to understand how the microenvironment of dense breasts promotes neoplastic transformation of the breast epithelium. Risk factor data and biological specimens (blood, buccal cells, tissue fluids, and tissue) required to discover mechanisms and biomarkers that link high mammographic density (as measured quantitatively using computerized methods) to breast cancer risk were collected from study participants.</p>

<p>Mammographic breast density, the radiological representation of the fibroglandular composition of the breast, is one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer. Epidemiologic evidence suggests that changes in breast density are related to changes in breast cancer risk. Ultrasound tomography (UST) is a novel radiological method that provides a three-dimensional image of the breast. Collaborators at Karmanos Cancer Institute have developed a UST device that allows the calculation of sound speed, an objective physical measurement that is positively correlated with breast density. Thus, UST offers the possibility of determining breast density serially over time as a volume, without compression of the breast or exposure to potentially harmful ionizing radiation.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In collaboration with researchers at Karmanos Cancer Institute and the University of Toronto, DCEG investigators are using UST to define the time course of volumetric breast density changes among women receiving tamoxifen treatment. Tamoxifen is known to reduce breast density and breast cancer risk. Investigators enrolled women receiving tamoxifen for atypical lobular or ductal hyperplasia, lobular or ductal carcinoma <i>in situ</i>, or invasive breast cancer at Karmanos Cancer Institute to undergo repeated volumetric breast density assessment with UST. Investigators are assessing whether UST examinations performed as early as 1-3 months following initiation of tamoxifen can identify women whose breast density is demonstrated to have declined at one year using mammography. For comparison, they enrolled age-, race-, and menopausal status-matched women without breast cancer to assess changes in UST density over time without tamoxifen exposure. Risk factor data and blood have also been collected from study participants. The broader study objective is to assess the concept of breast density as a biosensor of tamoxifen response and UST as a useful tool for making this determination.</p>

<p>Investigators in DCEG conducted a population-based case-control study of breast cancer to address a number of etiologic hypotheses best addressed among younger women, including effects on risk of oral contraceptive usage, dietary and physical activity patterns early in life, and prenatal factors. The study was conducted in three different geographic areas: Atlanta, New Jersey, and Seattle. Controls were identified through random digit dialing, although one site also employed a series of women identified through a complex area survey sampling technique. The majority of the subjects were younger than 45 years of age, although the age range was extended at one site to 55 years to allow a broader perspective on several issues. Detailed interviews and anthropometric measurements were undertaken. Pre-operative blood samples were obtained at one site from early stage cases and controls.</p>

<p>Investigators in DCEG and the Division of Cancer Prevention conducted a study of the clinical management of minor cervical cytologic abnormalities. The major hypothesis tested was whether HPV testing could be used reliably and accurately to triage the common cytologic diagnoses of ASC-US (atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance) and LSIL (low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions), which represent the bulk of cervical abnormalities seen on Pap smears. &#160;&#160;This clinical trial of management alternatives consisted of three arms: immediate colposcopic referral of all patients; triage using HPV testing as an adjunct to cytology; and conservative management with repeat Pap smears. All participants were followed every six months for two years. Over 5,000 women were randomized during enrollment that ended in December, 1998. The data showed that HPV DNA testing is a viable strategy for clarifying ASC-US cytology. However, HPV DNA prevalence in cases of LSIL proved too uniformly high to permit use of HPV DNA testing for triage. &#160;Residual specimens from ALTS are being used to validate new HPV tests, and to explore natural history questions.</p>

<p>Researchers now know that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the necessary but not sufficient cause of cervical cancer. Cervical pathogenesis evolves as follows: normal cervical tissue, to oncogenic HPV infection, to precancer and then to invasive cancer. The majority of women with oncogenic HPV infections will not develop cancer, and most HPV infections, even those with associated cellular changes, regress in 1-2 years, probably eradicated or controlled by cellular immune response. Moreover, while invasive cancer and precancer are histologically well-defined, the histological classification of low-grade lesions, now better defined as HPV infection, is very heterogeneous and poorly reproducible. Identifying women at highest risk for cancer prior to neoplastic progression is therefore a challenge. At present, researchers are unable to predict with any accuracy which HPV infections will progress and which are among the majority that regress. It is therefore of etiologic interest and of public health benefit to develop a method for identifying the HPV-infected women at risk for progressing to precancer and invasion.</p>
<p>In order to develop an accurate and reproducible division of precursor lesions (HPV infection and precancer), researchers must gain knowledge about the molecular distinctions at each progressive disease state. The goal of SUCCEED (Study to Understand Cervical Cancer Early Endpoints and Determinants) is to comprehensively assess biomarkers of risk for progressive cervical neoplasia, and thus develop biomarkers that can distinguish those at highest risk of cervical cancer from those with benign infection.</p>
<p>Investigators in DCEG have implemented a cross-sectional study to develop a comprehensive list of potential biomarkers by examining biospecimens and cervical tissues from over 2,500 women with HPV infection, precancer, and cancer. Several HPV-based markers, including HPV genotyping and detection of HPV integration have been evaluated in SUCCEED. A major focus is the evaluation of gene expression profiles to gain an accurate and comprehensive <i>in vivo</i> picture of cervical carcinogenesis. Investigators will validate the most promising identified candidate biomarkers in a prospective design by assessing their predictive values for key outcomes related to progression (HPV persistence, diagnosis of precancer) or non-progression (HPV clearance).</p>

<p>A collaborative study on colposcopic biopsy is being conducted at the University of Oklahoma, as part of an established project on cervical cancer risk-marker discovery. The aims of the study are to study cervical disease on the lesion level, to optimize criteria for biopsy placement, and to analyze the incremental benefit of taking multiple biopsies. The study is being conducted in close collaboration with the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Following a standardized protocol for biopsy placement based on decreasing order of lesion severity as judged by colposcopic impression, up to four biopsies, including one randomly taken, were performed on 700 women referred to colposcopy. Endocervical curettage was performed in women age 30 and older. Colposcopic impression, acetowhitening, and biopsy placement was documented using the Boundary Marking Tool (BMT), a digital imaging system developed in collaboration with the National Library of Medicine. All biopsies taken from each woman were analyzed separately using conventional histology, HPV typing, and biomarkers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators quantified the incremental benefit of taking additional targeted and random biopsies, and found that a single targeted biopsy missed over a third of prevalent precancers. Very few precancers were found with random biopsies. The results of the study will impact colposcopy and cervical cancer screening procedures in general. Making colposcopy more effective is important in a time of extensive screening (smaller lesions are detected) and vaccination against HPV (leading to an overall reduction of high grade lesions).</p>
<p>Several secondary aims are addressed in the study, including evaluation of biomarkers for cervical precancers like p16/Ki-67 cytology and urinary HPV testing. Investigators are also studying the topographic distribution and functional relation of multiple lesions on the cervix using HPV genotyping and biomarkers for viral transformation.</p>

<p>Human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and HPV-related cancers are a growing problem among HIV-infected populations, particularly in low-resource countries. Traditional cytology-based screening programs for cervical cancer prevention have failed everywhere other than resource-abundant settings. In resource-constrained settings, tests such as visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) can provide a suitable platform for clinical evaluation and are very cheap, however they are highly rater-dependent and suffer from substantial false positivity. Carcinogenic HPV DNA detection (e.g., HPV DNA testing by Hybrid Capture-2 assay) is less specific than cytology and cannot differentiate between the great majority of benign infections and the few persistent infections linked to cervical pre-cancer. A reliable and robust test that improves both the sensitivity and specificity of screening may provide better alternatives for HIV-infected women than conventional cytology screening or VIA.</p>
<p>This study, funded through the NIH Office of AIDS Research &lsquo;Intramural-to-India&rsquo; initiative, is being conducted in collaboration with the National AIDS Research Institute, a permanent institute of the Indian Council of Medical Research in Pune, India. A cohort of 1,000 HIV-infected women are undergoing evaluation using two novel and potentially sustainable, lower-cost tests for accurate screening for cervical cancer. These tests include HPV mRNA testing and immunocytochemical staining using p16INK4a/Ki-67 (a biomarker correlated with the oncogenic transformation of cervical cells following persistent carcinogenic HPV infection). The study involves simultaneous and independent evaluation of these novel biomarkers along with confirmation by colposcopy/histopathology for all participants. This observational study is enabling investigators to describe the sensitivity and specificity of any of the tests or combinations with reasonable precision in HIV-infected women. It is allowing evaluation of the field adoption and efficacy of these newer assays and is permitting validation of collection, transport, storage, and evaluation protocols.</p>

<p>The Colorectal Neoplasia Screening with Colonoscopy in Asymptomatic Women at Regional Navy/Army Medical Centers (CONCeRN) study is a multi-center study of asymptomatic women between the ages of 40 and 75 referred to regional military medical centers for routine colorectal screening. The primary purpose of the study is to determine the extent to which advanced neoplastic lesions will be missed if clinicians only perform sigmoidoscopies rather than full colonoscopies as a screening procedure and to resolve current debate about the significance of sigmoidoscopic detection of single, small, tubular adenomas. Women enrolled in the study receive colonoscopy during which all identified polyps are removed and also during which two pinch biopsies of apparently-normal tissue are taken. A NCI-led sub-study added a more extensive questionnaire to assess dietary and other lifestyle factors potentially related to colorectal cancer, and obtained additional blood for assessment of nutritional status and for analysis of genetic polymorphisms related to colorectal cancer. With the additional information, it will be possible to explore the extent to which various dietary and genetic risk factors are related to colorectal polyps in asymptomatic women of average risk for disease.</p>

<p>Currently, there are no convincing early detection approaches for endometrial and ovarian cancers. Although it is well established that some endometrial and ovarian tumors shed cytologically recognizable cells in routinely prepared Pap tests, it is clear that this approach rarely detects occult tumors. Accordingly, we need to develop strategies for collecting biological samples that have high patient acceptability, good sensitivity for detecting early disease, and excellent specificity.</p>
<p>DCEG investigators have been assessing the feasibility of using alternative sampling techniques in combination with molecular assays to detect endometrial and ovarian cancers. They are comparing two sampling techniques &ndash; one using a tampon, and the other using a sheathed endometrial brush (called a Tao brush), and are assessing the quality of DNA extracted from the different samplers. The investigators aim to study the association between methylation of somatic DNA for a selected marker panel and cancer status.</p>
<p>Testing began with a pilot study of 117 women aged 45 years and older with suspected endometrial cancer or ovarian cancer, and 53 age-matched controls without malignancy, conducted in collaboration with researchers at the Mayo Clinic. Several candidate methylation markers for endometrial cancer were successfully evaluated in tampon and Tao brush specimens collected from women with endometrial cancer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators seek to replicate their findings in a larger study to evaluate biomarkers for endometrial cancer at the Mayo Clinic. Samples are being collected, using Tao brush and tampon, from over 800 women who present with increased risk of endometrial cancer. Women will be prospectively followed for endometrial hyperplasia and cancer endpoints.</p>

<p>This is a case-control study nested within a retrospective cohort of approximately 8,000 women diagnosed with endometrial hyperplasia from 1970-2002 in a pre-paid health plan. The goal of the study is to define risks of progression for histological categories of endometrial hyperplasia, the precursor of typical forms on endometrial carcinoma, and to validate candidate molecular pathological prognostic markers to assess risk of subsequent carcinoma. Cases included 138 women with pathology panel confirmed endometrial hyperplasia who progressed to carcinoma; controls consisted of 241 women with pathology confirmed endometrial hyperplasia matched on age, date of diagnosis and duration of follow-up and counter-matched on severity of hyperplasia. The study has shown that the risk of progression among women with atypical hyperplasia, the most severe form, is 8% through four years rising to 28% through 19 years of follow-up. The study has shown that non-atypical forms of endometrial hyperplasia are far less likely to progress than atypical hyperplasia. The study includes basic data related to patient characteristics and treatment and multiple tissues from initial and repeat biopsies. A tissue microarray has been prepared from the endometrial cancer tissues. Current activities are focusing on validating biomarkers in endometrial hyperplasia that predict risk of progression to cancer, including immunohistochemical stains and molecular assays.</p>

<p>This population-based case-control study was conducted in the metropolitan areas of Detroit and Chicago in collaboration with Wayne State University and the University of Illinois at Chicago. The aims of this study are to evaluate risk factors for renal cell cancer and examine why rates of this disease are higher among U.S. blacks than whites. Between 2002 and 2007, DCEG investigators interviewed and collected saliva and blood samples from 1,217 cases (856 white, 361 black) and 1,235 controls (712 white, 523 black). Tumor tissue blocks, diagnostic slides, and medical records were also collected from cases. Factors being evaluated include hypertension and other medical conditions, medication use, obesity and weight fluctuation, cigarette smoking, occupational exposures, markers of genetic susceptibility, and several molecular markers in tumor tissue and peripheral blood. Findings to date suggest that black-white differences in hypertension and chronic kidney disease might explain a substantial portion of the racial disparity in kidney cancer incidence.</p>

<p>Childhood leukemia is the most common type of childhood cancer and its etiology is largely unknown. Investigators in DCEG are collaborating with investigators at University of California at Berkeley on a population-based case-control study of childhood leukemia in the San Francisco Bay area and the agricultural Central Valley (35 counties). A substantial proportion of the population in this area is employed in agriculture or lives in close proximity to agricultural fields, making this an ideal study population to evaluate agricultural pesticide exposures and risk of childhood leukemia. Furthermore, a large proportion of the study population is Hispanic. No previous large-scale childhood leukemia studies have targeted Hispanics or agricultural populations. A major aim of the collaboration is to improve the exposure assessment of agricultural and home and garden pesticides by measuring pesticides in house dust samples. Investigators are also measuring other chemical exposures including cotinine, PCBs, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. In addition to evaluating specific chemical levels in dust and risk of childhood leukemia, investigators are conducting several methodological studies to evaluate factors associated with residential exposure to these chemicals.</p>

<p>Liver cancer incidence and mortality have been increasing in the United States since 1980. Reasons for the increases are not clear. Known risk factors include chronic infections with hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus, excessive consumption of alcohol, certain rare metabolic disorders (e.g., hemochromatosis), diabetes and obesity. Whether these factors explain liver cancer in the U.S. has not been adequately examined. As a result, investigators in DCEG are conducting a liver cancer pooling project among existing U.S. cohorts in order to explore liver cancer etiology in a prospective manner. Cohorts are contributing questionnaire data and serum samples to this effort. As liver cancer remains a rare disease, despite the increasing incidence, additional U.S. cohorts are being sought to participate in this investigation.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://emblem.cancer.gov/">Epidemiology of Burkitt Lymphoma in East-African Children and Minors (EMBLEM)</a> study is a large, multidisciplinary epidemiological effort designed to evaluate environmental and host factors associated with childhood Burkitt lymphoma (BL) in sub-Saharan Africa. The study is expected to enroll 1,500 BL cases and 3,000 population controls from six rural sites in the East African regions northern Uganda, northeastern Tanzania, and western Kenya. The primary objectives of EMBLEM are to characterize and quantify the association between BL and: a) malaria, based on carriage of malaria-resistance genes; b) carcinogenic Epstein-Barr virus variants; and c) non-malaria-resistance related germline and somatic genetic polymorphisms. In addition to collecting a unique data and sample resource for study of the interplay between infectious agents, genetics, and behavioral/lifestyle factors in the pathogenesis of childhood BL, EMBLEM provides a new model for direct and immediate improvements in BL communication, diagnosis, and treatment of BL in Africa.</p>

<p>The goal of the <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/InterLymph/">International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium</a> (InterLymph) is to enhance collaboration among epidemiologists studying lymphoma, provide a forum for the exchange of research ideas, and create a framework for collaborating on analyses that pool data from multiple studies. Within the consortium, DCEG investigators are currently leading pooled analyses to 1) investigate whether the risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma associated with cigarette smoking and personal hair dye use is modified by genetic variation in N-acetyltransferase 1 (<i>NAT1</i>) and 2 (<i>NAT2</i>), which encode enzymes that metabolize aromatic and heterocyclic amines, and 2) provide the first comprehensive assessments of risk factors for several rare lymphoma subtypes.</p>

<p>For the last decade, DCEG investigators have collaborated on the NCI-SEER Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) Case-Control Study, a multi-center, population-based study of 1,321 NHL cases and 1,057 controls that includes detailed interview data, biospecimens, and environmental samples. Currently, DCEG investigators are collaborating on studies using the candidate gene approach to identify common genetic variants in relation to both NHL susceptibility and survival within the NCI-SEER NHL Study, focusing on key genes in cell cycle control, DNA repair, and immune function pathways that likely contribute to lymphomagenesis. They are also conducting molecular studies utilizing the paraffin-embedded tumor tissue collected for approximately 70% of the cases.</p>

<p>DCEG investigators conducted a case-control study of 718 non-Hispanic white patients with cutaneous melanoma from melanoma clinics in Philadelphia and San Francisco, and are completing analyses of the risk factors for melanoma and nevi. Investigators have also analyzed data on sunbed use and found that sunbed use is a significant risk factor for melanoma, after adjustment for all other UV exposure. Sunscreen use provided some protection, particularly in those most susceptible.</p>

<p>A case-control study is being conducted in Italy to study the role of pigmentation and other host factors in the etiology of melanoma in a population with a wide range of pigmentary phenotypes and intense sun exposure. This is a collaborative study between the NCI, Bufalini Hospital, Cesena, and the University of L&rsquo;Aquila, L&rsquo;Aquila, Italy. The study includes over 350 melanoma cases and 350 healthy controls, matched by age, sex and residence. To address the genetic determinants of melanoma in the Mediterranean population through a different approach, a family study of melanoma is also currently ongoing in the same areas of Italy. To date, the study includes 76 families with 2 to 5 melanoma-affected individuals per family. Unaffected relatives from these families are also enrolled.</p>
<p>An additional project includes melanoma patients participating in either the Italian case/control or the Italian family study of melanoma who have agreed to donate multiple tissue biopsies from normal skin, common melanocytic nevi, dysplastic nevi and melanoma to allow the investigation of the pathways potentially involved in the transition from common nevi to melanoma.</p>
