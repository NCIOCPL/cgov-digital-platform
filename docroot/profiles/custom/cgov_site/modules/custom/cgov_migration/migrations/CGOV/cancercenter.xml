It became an NCI-designated cancer center in 1978 and received Comprehensive Cancer Center status in 1990. UACC developed a scientific program in cancer prevention and control in the 1980s, with special emphasis on colon, breast, prostate, and skin cancer. UACC is also a translational center that has developed a range of new cancer treatment and preventive agents and has spun off more than 17 companies.</p><p>The Center&#8217;s basic, translational/clinical, and cancer prevention research is carried out in four scientific programs: cancer prevention and control, cancer biology, cancer imaging, and therapeutic development. Specific research projects include breast and ovarian cancer, lung cancer, prostate cancer, gastrointestinal cancers (colon, pancreas, and liver), lymphoma, and melanoma/skin cancer.</p><p>To serve the diverse population of Arizona and the Southwest, UACC established a Cancer Health Disparities Institute to focus on cancers in underserved Hispanic and Native American populations. The Institute provides research and training opportunities for investigators proposing research or planning to work in underserved communities.</p><p>UACC hosts a Cancer Biology Graduate Interdisciplinary Program. The program draws faculty from 14 academic departments and five colleges across the University of Arizona.<br />The Center&#8217;s research is conducted in Tucson and in Phoenix. There are also more than a dozen research and education offices throughout the state, as well as affiliate sites in Mexico and Colorado. UACC has 73 research laboratories, where 300 physicians and scientists conduct collaborative research.</p><p>Using a research-driven and evidence-based approach, patients at UACC are treated in multidisciplinary, disease-site-oriented clinics by teams of physicians and health care professionals. The Center&#8217;s hospital affiliates are the University of Arizona Medical Center in Tucson, and Dignity Health St. Joseph&#8217;s Hospital and Medical Center in Phoenix, where a new outpatient facility is opening in mid-2015.</p><p><em>* This profile was provided by the University of Arizona Cancer Center.</em></p></div>]]></body>

In 1994, it became an NCI-designated cancer center, and it achieved comprehensive cancer center status in 1997. Soon after, it was renamed in honor of the Chao family as the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center (CFCCC), operating fully integrated research, prevention, diagnostic, treatment, and rehabilitation programs.</p><p>The Center fosters bench-to-bedside research, with programs ranging from basic science research to clinical trials. The mandate for the entire range of programs is to translate the findings of basic research into treatments that can benefit patients. Clinical research at CFCCC focuses on breast, skin, colon, liver, oral, pancreatic, and prostate cancer, and includes prevention. The Center is deeply involved in a national test program investigating the effectiveness of promising new cancer prevention drugs at several sites across the country. This work involves the design of early-phase clinical trials to assess the cancer prevention potential of a variety of agents, many of which target specific molecules known to be active in precancerous conditions.</p><p>An active program of research and a quest for productive affiliations led to an institutional affiliation with Children&#8217;s Hospital of Orange County. This relationship enabled the integration of pediatric oncology with the research activities of the Center&#8217;s Development Biology Research program. The overwhelming majority (85 percent) of children at the hospital are enrolled in clinical trials.</p><p>There are other important collaborations at CFCCC. The dual approach of structure-based chemical targeting from the Center&#8217;s chemical synthesis facility, combined with advanced imaging techniques, provides a powerful platform for the development of new cancer prevention and therapeutic interventions now and in the future. The expanding integration of chemoprevention and genetic epidemiology brings together at-risk individuals and chemoprevention in a next generation of trials. Initial therapeutic successes in this field have led to further trials in the fields of gynecologic malignancies, brain, lung, prostate, melanoma, breast, colorectal, pancreatic, and hepatic cancers. In this effort, the Center&#8217;s disease-oriented Translational Working Groups combine their research work with the Population Sciences program.</p><p>Community outreach is a major element of the Center&#8217;s work. The transfer and dissemination of new technologies to the community is a major goal of the CFCCC. The members of the Onco-Imaging and Spectroscopy program, housed in two centers at the university, are applying technologies they have developed to several hypothesis-driven, investigator-initiated clinical trials. The activity in the breast cancer area led to the formation of a translational Breast Health and Research Clinic.</p><p>CFCCC&#8217;s international outreach extends to several countries in the Middle East, Russia, Korea, Japan, and China. Several formal agreements have been signed to enable joint education and research activities with those countries.</p><p><em>* This profile was provided by the Chao Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.</em></p></div>]]></body>

<p>In 1973, the University of Pennsylvania established a cancer center to serve as the focus and stimulus for all cancer-related activities at the University. In 1974, it was designated as a comprehensive cancer center by NCI and in 2002, it was renamed the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania. The mission of the Center is the eradication of cancer as a cause of human disease and suffering. The Abramson Cancer Center seeks to achieve this through relentless progress in basic research, innovative translation of new knowledge through clinical trials, and state-of-the-art cancer care. The Abramson Cancer Center established the Madlyn and Leonard Abramson Family Cancer Research Institute at the Center so that patients benefit directly from research advances.</p>
<p>The 314 faculty members at the Center support 11 Research Programs that bring together investigators from 47 departments and eight schools with a shared interest in specific types of cancer or scientific themes. The goal of the Abramson Cancer Center is to facilitate collaborations that would otherwise not be possible in a traditional cancer center organized by departments. The research teams are multidisciplinary, bringing together experts in fundamental and translational research. The Center&rsquo;s Research Programs cover: breast cancer, cancer control, cancer therapeutics, hematologic malignancies, immunobiology, melanoma and cutaneous malignancies, pediatric oncology, radiobiology and imaging, tobacco and environmental carcinogenesis, tumor biology, and tumor virology. Areas of concentrated research and clinical focus within the Center include the Basser Research Center for BRCA1/2, the Center for Personalized Diagnostics, the Center for Rare Cancers, the Penn Pancreatic Cancer Research Center, and the Center for Advanced Cellular Therapy.</p>
<p>The Abramson Cancer Center has led the way in innovative cancer care in a number of areas including: discovery of the Philadelphia Chromosome &mdash; the first evidence that abnormal chromosomes can cause cancer; development of antibody approaches to fighting cancer, leading the way in targeted cancer treatment, including the breast cancer drug Herceptin&reg;; development &nbsp;of transoral robotic surgery (TORS), a breakthrough minimally invasive procedure; &nbsp;providing evidence of sustained remissions of up to three years among a group of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and acute lymphocytic leukemia patients treated with genetically engineered versions of their own T-cells; engineering a second generation of T-cells that can eradicate deadly ovarian cancer; and founding OncoLink &ndash; the first cancer resource on the Internet.</p>
<p>Cancer treatment at the Center is provided by multidisciplinary teams that include physician specialists, nurses, patient support specialists, cancer counselors, dietitians, genetic counselors and rehabilitation therapists. The full range of cancer therapies are offered at the Abramson Cancer Center&rsquo;s main building, the Perelman Center for Advanced Medicine, including proton therapy at the Roberts Proton Therapy Center and through the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Penn Presbyterian Medical Center, Pennsylvania Hospital, and Chester County Hospital.The Center takes a holistic approach to care, addressing the psycho-social and physical needs of patients and offers a full range of services geared toward prevention, risk management, diagnosis, advanced treatment, a full range of clinical trials and surveillance after cancer. Support services are provided during and following treatment, from dietary plans to rehabilitation and integrative/complementary programs and assistance for cancer survivors through its Living Well After Cancer&trade; Program and the OncoLife survivorship care plan powered by Oncolink.</p>

The Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center (JAXCC) comprises three campuses. The approximately 50 JAXCC members have complementary expertise and are united in research aimed at understanding and targeting the genomic complexity of cancer. The Bar Harbor faculty have deep expertise in mouse biology, complex genetics, and computational biology that informs new experimental platforms including genetically defined mouse models bearing humanized disease alleles; improved mouse hosts for patient derived xenografted (PDX) primary human cancers; and novel mouse populations that model the genetic variation of human populations. The Farmington faculty are experts in human cancer genomics; genome biology; quantitative cell biology; computational biology and analytics, all centered on developing approaches to precision medicine. The Sacramento campus has established a large, collaborative resource of PDX models as a major preclinical platform.</p><p>The JAXCC has one research program entitled Genetic models for precision cancer medicine. The program&#8217;s three overlapping themes collectively drive research towards identifying precise interventions to prevent cancer from progressing to an untreatable state. The cancer cell robustness theme identifies genome alterations at a systems level that render cancer cells resistant to new therapies. The genetic and genomic complexity theme explores the overall genome architecture of cancer cells and how deviations from normal cells drive cancer biology and can be exploited for novel therapeutic interventions. The progenitor cell biology theme addresses the molecular and cellular mechanisms that drive progenitor cell transformation and progression. Work in all three themes requires collaboration with innovators in genomic technologies and computational analyses, cell biology, and mouse model development.</p><p>The scale of these converging resources and expertise position the JAXCC and its collaborators to generate and validate improved preclinical models; extract from them meaningful molecular indicators of tumor response or resistance to therapy; and move these indicators toward incorporation in clinical trials. The JAXCC, together with SWOG and Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, have engaged with the NCI&#8217;s National Clinical Trials Network to form an Integrated Translational Science Center that supports incorporation of molecular indicators into clinical trials. Collaborations with a growing number of NCI-designated as well as regional cancer care centers also fuel this translational pipeline.<br /><br />Educational programs include a post-doctoral program, cooperative PhD programs with the University of Maine and with Tufts University, and a summer residential internship program. Annually, 20 courses and conferences are held on the JAXCC campuses. Cyberlearning programs, with a priority on physician continuing education in cancer genetics and genomics, expand the outreach potential of the JAXCC.</p><p><em>* This cancer center is one of seven cancer centers that only conduct laboratory research and do not provide patient care.<br />* This profile was provided by the Jackson Laboratory Cancer Center.</em></p></div>]]></body>

Research and development in each of these programs involves cross-disciplinary teams of faculty, students, and staff. To add strength to their efforts, they also encompass collaborations with clinical, industrial, and organizational partners.</p><p>The Koch Institute is committed to shortening the time needed for breakthrough discoveries to directly benefit cancer patients. Research partnerships with medical schools, hospitals, and industry expand the reach of MIT&#8217;s cancer research into pre-clinical and translational projects. Through the Bridge Project, a joint program of the Koch Institute and the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center, researchers from both NCI-designated cancer centers in Massachusetts form cross-disciplinary teams to bring bioengineering, advanced cancer science, and clinical oncology together to solve today&#8217;s most challenging problems in cancer research and care. In addition, the Koch Institute&#8217;s Clinical Investigator program provides support for physician-scientists to conduct cancer research at MIT while maintaining clinical activity at oncology treatment centers in Boston. The Koch Institute has also developed important translational partnerships with biopharmaceutical companies and has spun out a number of biotechnology and medical device companies as well.</p><p>The Koch Institute&#8217;s facility on the MIT campus, completed in 2010, provides space for 600 cancer researchers to deploy leading-edge technology, engineering, biology, and computation to invent new and more effective ways to address cancer. The collaboration of Institute researchers with over 20 other MIT departments and laboratories brings MIT&#8217;s total interdisciplinary cancer research force to over 1,000, augmented by the Institute&#8217;s proximity to more than 90 biotechnology and biopharmaceutical firms and 14 hospitals. Included in the building is the Swanson Biotechnology Center, which provides technical tools, services, and training to the Institute&#8217;s life scientists and engineers.</p><p><em>* This cancer center is one of seven cancer centers that only conduct laboratory research and do not provide patient care.<br />* This profile was provided by the David H.

<p>The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey was established in 1991 at Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, and is a matrix/consortium with Princeton University and New Jersey&rsquo;s only NCI-designated Comprehensive Cancer Center. The Rutgers Cancer Institute focuses the strengths and resources of the major research institutions in the state on addressing the cancer burden in its catchment area, the state of New Jersey, where it serves a diverse population of 8.9 million people. &nbsp;The Rutgers Cancer Institute is an independent institute of Rutgers University, optimizing its potential for growth, transdisciplinary collaboration, and impact across the catchment area. There are 227 members (206 Rutgers, 19 Princeton, and 2 collaborating). Another component of the cancer center is The State Cancer Registry and Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, which collects cancer statistics, serves as a local and national resource for epidemiologic studies into the causes, treatments and outcomes in patients with cancer in New Jersey.</p>
<p>The Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey is dedicated to improving the prevention, detection, treatment, and care of patients with cancer, through the translation of laboratory discoveries into clinical practice. Its research base spans five Programs: Cancer Metabolism and Growth, Genomic Instability and Cancer Genetics, Cancer Pharmacology, Clinical Investigations and Precision Therapeutics, and Cancer Prevention and Control. These Programs are supported by eight shared resources (Biomedical Informatics, Biometrics, Biorepository and Histopathology Service, Comprehensive Genomics, Flow Cytometry/Cell Sorting, Genome Editing, Metabolomics, and Research Pharmacy), and two developing shared resources (Immune Monitoring, Small Molecule Screening). With this organizational structure, the Rutgers Cancer Institute mobilizes and leverages exceptional scientific and clinical capabilities to reduce the burden of cancer in New Jersey and beyond by advancing cancer research, prevention, screening and education.</p>
<p>Groundbreaking research at the Rutgers Cancer Institute identified novel metabolic and genomic characteristics of tumors and mechanisms of cancer metastasis that are being targeted for anti-cancer drug discovery. Through the practice of precision medicine, molecular characterization of patient tumors through targeted DNA analysis and assessment of the findings by a molecular tumor board guides diagnosis and implementation of the most advanced targeted therapies. Research breakthroughs have established the optimal means to deploy the newest immune therapies to treat and eradicate cancer. Population research illuminated ways that big tobacco companies circumvented increased regulation of cigarettes by marketing alternative products, which led to new State and national regulations to curb tobacco use and the cancers that subsequently arise. In collaboration with the New Jersey Department of Health, the Rutgers Cancer Institute launched enhanced colon and lung cancer screening, <u>ScreenNJ</u>, to reduce cancer incidence and mortality through an effective cancer prevention and screening program, which includes education, navigation, and analysis of the impact of improving cancer screening on patient health.</p>
<p>Comprehensive treatment is provided by multidisciplinary teams of experts including oncologists, hematologists, nurses, pharmacists, social workers, nutritionists and others all under one roof to help educate patients so that they can make informed decisions about their care. Patients have access to clinical trials and other services through a partnership with the RWJBarnabas Health System, the largest in the state. Thus, the Rutgers Cancer Institute provides state-of-the-art cancer care delivery that spans New Jersey.</p>

<p>In 1971, the Georgetown Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center (Georgetown Lombardi) was established at Georgetown University, becoming an NCI-designated cancer center in 1974. The Center achieved NCI comprehensive status in 1990. Georgetown Lombardi is part of Georgetown University Medical Center and Georgetown University Hospital. The mission of the Center is to improve the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of cancer through innovative basic science, clinical research, patient care, community outreach, and the training of cancer specialists of the future.</p>
<p>Georgetown Lombardi comprises 165 members, scientists and physicians, who work in five research programs focusing on breast cancer, cancer control, cancer risk, clinical experimental therapeutics, and molecular oncology and carcinogenesis. The Center&rsquo;s research emphases include high-priority transdisciplinary initiatives, minority health and health disparities, and systems biomedicine initiatives.</p>
<p>The Center pursues local and regional partnerships to expand its community outreach. Georgetown Lombardi researchers and clinicians contributed to the first cancer control plan for Washington, D.C. in 2006. The Capital Breast Care Center (CBCC) in southeast Washington is a major initiative to reduce breast cancer disparities. The Center also established a joint partnership with the University of the District of Columbia to investigate ways to increase cancer awareness and reduce cancer incidence among African Americans.</p>
<p>Georgetown Lombardi established an Office of Minority Health and Health Disparities to conduct research focused on reducing cancer disparities among underserved minority populations in Washington, including African Americans, Latinos, and Asian Americans and plans to open a satellite office in the city to better fulfill its community-based research mission.</p>
<p>The Center has recently expanded its tissue banking and clinical annotation capabilities to support systems biomedicine in collaboration with Indivumed GmbH. Recently, Georgetown Lombardi launched the Georgetown Database of Cancer (G-DOC), a data integration platform and knowledge discovery system for the oncology and translational research communities. By aggregating public and proprietary clinical, molecular, and genomic data from across the Medical Center, G-DOC is expected to bring about significant advances in personalized medicine and promote the identification of new drug targets and therapeutic modalities.</p>
<p>Patient care takes place at the Georgetown University Hospital, a part of MedStar Health, a non-profit regional network of nine hospitals and 20 other health-related businesses. The Georgetown Lombardi-MedStar relationship has resulted in increased accrual to clinical trials.</p>
<p>Education and training of tomorrow&rsquo;s leaders in cancer treatment and research is at the core of Georgetown Lombardi&rsquo;s mission, spanning all levels of learning, from programs for high school students to postdoctoral fellowships.

<p>Founded in 1972, Norris Cotton Cancer Center (NCCC)&rsquo;s comprehensive NCI designation was renewed through peer review in 2014. The Center integrates cancer research at the College, and in particular its Geisel School of Medicine and Thayer School of Engineering, with patient-centered cancer care provided at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, NH, and at 16 regional locations and partner hospitals in New Hampshire and Vermont. NCCC is the only NCI-designated clinical center based in this Northern New England catchment area. NCCC is committed to providing access to research-based care, advanced technologies, and clinical trials for patients throughout northern New England. We are an active partner with the CDC-funded New Hampshire Comprehensive Cancer Collaboration and Dartmouth&rsquo;s CDC-funded Prevention Research Center.</p>
<p>The Center&rsquo;s 150 member investigators advance cancer science in six program areas: cancer control, cancer mechanisms, cancer epidemiology, cancer imaging and radiobiology, immunology and cancer immunotherapy, and molecular therapeutics. Cancer research represents a majority ($60 million annually) of all peer-reviewed research in the Geisel School of Medicine, and a majority of the clinical trial enrollment at Dartmouth-Hitchcock. In partnership with The Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice (TDI), NCCC has developed important NCI-funded cancer registries in breast and colon cancer screening, and is shaping new work in health delivery, outcomes, and comparative effectiveness research. NCCC&rsquo;s Rubin Building on the Dartmouth-Hitchcock campus provides facilities to foster these collaborations, with expansion into the adjacent Williamson Translational Research Building scheduled for 2015.</p>
<p>Physicians and scientists collaborate to speed the translation of research advances into novel treatments for cancer patients through interdisciplinary clinical programs to 3,000 new and 33,000 current patients annually. More than 200 cancer specialists work in teams, meeting in weekly interdisciplinary tumor boards, to treat patients with all types of cancer using the latest technologies in diagnostics and imaging; medical, radiation, and surgical oncology; bone marrow transplantation; and immunotherapy. NCCC is one of 30 NCI-designated Lead Academic Participants in the National Cancer Trial Network. The newly opened Center for Surgical Innovation integrates intra-operative imaging into clinical care and research.</p>
<p>Community education and care are of great importance to NCCC. Research on behavioral risk factors (such as smoking, obesity, and sun exposure) and on environmental risk factors (such as arsenic) is translated into community education and prevention programs targeted to the region&rsquo;s rural, underserved populations.</p>
<p>The Center has developed innovative approaches to delivering advanced cancer care and technologies to remote patients throughout its rural region. Web- and computer-based media enable patients to provide important medical and psychosocial input to their care team. Interdisciplinary clinics coordinate visits to several providers in a single day, allowing patients to meet with the specialists who together will design their personalized treatment plan. Once a plan is developed, patients may receive much of their care close to home through a regional center or affiliated hospital, partnering with the American Cancer Society patient navigation program.</p>

<p>The Herbert Irving Comprehensive Cancer Center (HICCC) at Columbia University Medical Center was founded in 1911 as the Institute for Cancer Research. In 1972, it became an NCI-designated cancer center, and it was awarded comprehensive status in 1979. The HICCC is the University&rsquo;s organizational component for the conduct of basic, clinical, and population-based cancer research and patient care.</p>
<p>The Center&rsquo;s mission is to understand the biology of cancer and apply that knowledge to the design of cancer therapies and prevention strategies that reduce its incidence and progression. HICCC&rsquo;s more than 240 members are drawn from six schools at Columbia and, joined with the cancer-related patient services provided at New York Presbyterian Hospital, form an extensive collaborative group of researchers and clinicians working to provide the best approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of all types of cancer.</p>
<p>Research at HICCC is organized into eight research programs within three divisions. The Basic Science Division includes programs in Cancer Regulatory Networks and Cancer Genetics and Epigenetics. Programs in the Disease-Specific Division focus on Breast Cancer, Lymphoid Development and Malignancy, Prostate Cancer, and Neuro-Oncology. The Population Science Division&rsquo;s programs include Cancer Epidemiology as well as Prevention, Control, and Disparities. These programs focus on different aspects of cancer from its molecular and cellular mechanisms through its unique behavior in different tissues to statistical aspects of its occurrence and treatment in large populations. The members of each program share a commitment to reduce cancer incidence and tumor progression and to improve the quality of life of those affected by cancer.</p>
<p>The Center offers training programs in affiliation with the University in the areas of basic laboratory research, epidemiology and public health, and clinical science, with special emphases on cancer biology, environmental health/epidemiology, and adult and pediatric hematology/oncology.</p>
<p>HICCC is located in the Washington Heights neighborhood, one of the most ethnically and racially diverse populations in New York City. The Center has created a range of patient care and clinical research programs to bring its services to every group in the neighborhood. To that end, HICCC has developed two specific activities: Research Recruitment and Minority Outreach to bring underrepresented people into clinical trials; and the Columbia University Cancer Screening Center to provide free mammography and other screening services to our local community.</p>

<p>Roswell Park Cancer Institute (RPCI) was the first institution in the nation dedicated exclusively to cancer research. Founded in 1898 by eminent American surgeon Roswell Park, M.D., it began as the University of Buffalo Pathological Laboratory. With the opening of a hospital in 1913, the Institute strengthened its focus on moving scientific discoveries from the laboratory to the patient&rsquo;s bedside.</p>
<p>Today more than 31,000 patients from 48 states and 13 countries are in active care at RPCI, where clinicians and scientists work together to fulfill its mission: to understand, prevent and cure cancer. The emphasis on both research and treatment has earned RPCI a place among the NCI&rsquo;s 41 comprehensive cancer centers, a distinction it has held continuously since 1974.</p>
<p>RPCI&rsquo;s Cancer Center Support Grant (CCSG) was renewed by the NCI in 2014 with a rating of Outstanding. The CCSG supports the Institute&rsquo;s six research programs: Cell Stress &amp; Biophysical Therapies, Experimental Therapeutics, Genetics, Genitourinary Cancers, Population Sciences, and Tumor Immunology &amp; Immunotherapy.</p>
<p>RPCI provides access to the newest and most promising cancer therapies through clinical research studies (clinical trials), and is home to the largest phase I clinical trials program in New York State. Through clinical trials, RPCI patients were among the first to benefit from such drugs as Herceptin&reg; and Gleevec&reg;, as well as therapies pioneered at RPCI, including 5-FU + leucovorin therapy for colorectal cancer.</p>
<p>In recent years the Institute has accelerated the development of new treatments aimed at harnessing the power of the immune system. Its Center for Immunotherapy, opened in 2011, supports the creation of cancer vaccines, which are offered through clinical trials for many types of solid tumors. RPCI is one of 30 member sites of the Cancer Immunotherapy Trials Network and home to an FDA-approved Therapeutic Cell Production Facility. The Institute has also launched a Center for Personalized Medicine, where rapid, next-generation gene sequencing matches a patient&rsquo;s unique genetic profile with the most appropriate treatments.</p>
<p>Through the Roswell Park Graduate Division of the State University of New York at Buffalo, RPCI provides specialized clinical and research training in oncology for hundreds of students and medical professionals from all over the world.</p>

<p>The Wistar Institute was founded in 1892 as an anatomical museum and anatomical research and training center, but quickly evolved into a biomedical research facility that gained an international reputation over the course if its rich history. Throughout the 20th century, Wistar pioneered animal model studies and vaccine development. Continuing its course of discoveries and biomedical breakthroughs, Wistar today is an international leader in basic biomedical research in cancer and infectious diseases, with a focus on discoveries leading to the development of novel therapies and vaccines.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 1972, the Institute became the first NCI-designated cancer center in basic research. The mission of the Wistar Institute Cancer Center is to merge basic, translational and patient-oriented cancer research in a single scientific continuum with focus on cancer prevention, diagnosis and therapy. The Center&rsquo;s scientists pursue research to understand the causes, treatment, and prevention of cancer. The Cancer Center has a long history of significant advances in cancer genetics, cancer biology, tumor immunology, and virology, including the identification of genetic alterations associated with cancer, the development of monoclonal antibodies used to study pathways and proteins involved in tumor development, and contributions to improved cancer treatments and diagnostic tests.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Wistar Institute Cancer Center is structured into three research programs, taking an interdisciplinary approach to cancer research: Gene Expression and Regulation; Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis; and Immunology, Microenvironment and Metastasis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The Gene Expression and Regulation Program leverages expertise in genomics, biochemistry and structural biology approaches to characterize mechanisms of transcriptional regulation, epigenetics, chromosome organization and RNA-mediated gene regulation, with an emphasis on their roles in cancer etiology and therapeutics. The Program aims to merge basic understanding of fundamental biological mechanisms with translational identification of new, actionable therapeutic targets in cancer. To address this goal, the Program brings together complementary and synergistic scientific expertise in three themes: 1) transcription and chromatin organization, 2) non-coding RNAs and epigenetics, and 3) chromosomes and genome dynamics. In addition, the Program is also at the forefront of an interdisciplinary theme in chemical biology and novel cancer drug targets.</li>
<li>The Molecular and Cellular Oncogenesis Program focuses on the underlying processes of normal and malignant cell growth and differentiation. The goal of the Program is to employ a strong mechanistic understanding of cancer signaling networks to improve diagnosis and therapy, spanning the continuum of basic, translational and patient-oriented cancer research. Program members merge unique expertise in basic and translational cancer biology with proteomics, functional genomics, bioinformatics and medicinal chemistry to provide impactful contributions on three main research themes: 1) mechanisms of cancer growth control, 2) targeted cancer therapeutics, and 3) systems biology/cancer &ldquo;&ndash;omics&rdquo;.</li>
<li>The Immunology, Microenvironment and Metastasis Program addresses the basic mechanisms that govern the host-tumor interactions and metastatic dissemination to find novel translational opportunities for diseases diagnosis and therapy, with special emphasis on the mechanisms regulating immune responses in cancer and their potential therapeutic manipulation. Program members focus on three main themes in the biology of the tumor microenvironment: 1) mechanisms of local immunosuppression; 2) tumor-host crosstalk in disease progression and treatment response; and 3) pathways of metastatic competence.</li>
</ul>
<p>Wistar cancer research is also organized through collaborative research centers that support the work of the Cancer Center. The Wistar Institute Melanoma Research Center strives to understand the unique biology of melanoma, especially concentrating on the mechanisms of therapy resistance and on the role of the tumor microenvironment in tumor progression. The Center serves as a collaborative hub bringing together basic scientists, clinicians, the life sciences industry and melanoma advocates to save lives through research and development of new and better therapies.</p>
<p>Additional scientific centers of note at Wistar are the Center for Systems and Computational Biology and the Vaccine &amp; Immunotherapy Center, which are synergistically aligned with the Cancer Center to leverage the Institute&rsquo;s strengths in immunology, virology and immune-oncology to improve public health through the creation of next-generation vaccines and therapeutic antibodies for life-threatening diseases, including cancer.</p>
<p>Functioning as engines of discovery for biomedical research initiatives, Wistar Institute Shared Resources provide professional expertise and innovative state-of-the art technologies to Cancer Center Program members. Shared Resources supported by the Cancer Center Support Grant, awarded by the National Cancer Institute, include: Animal Facility, Bioinformatics, Biomedical Research Support Facility, Flow Cytometry, Genomics, Imaging, Molecular Screening &amp; Protein Expression and Proteomics &amp; Metabolomics.</p>
<p>Scientific collaboration is at the core of the Institute&rsquo;s approach to research. Through agreements with other institutions, Wistar researchers have preferred access to collaborating resources, including the Gene Editing Institute at Helen F. Graham Cancer Center and the Cell Culture and Transgenic Mouse Facilities at the Fox Chase Cancer Center.</p>
<p>Since the Institute&rsquo;s inception, training the next generation of scientific investigators has been a vital part of Wistar&rsquo;s mission. Wistar is committed to training pre-doctoral students, postdoctoral fellows, and visiting scientists. Education at the Institute extends into the Philadelphia community, including science mentoring programs for high school students, a biotechnology training program for college students and a biomedical research apprenticeship program.</p>
<p>The Wistar Institute Cancer Center is committed to accelerating research advances from bench to bedside through brilliant science and distinctive approaches to collaboration among scientific investigators and academic and industry partners worldwide.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1974, the Cancer Therapy &amp; Research Center (CTRC) at the University of Texas (UT) Health Science Center at San Antonio began to offer outpatient radiation therapy to the local community. In 1991, CTRC launched its Institute for Drug Development (IDD) to find new treatments for patients with cancer through the integration of research programs of excellence in the translational and clinical sciences. Over the years, the Center expanded, and, in 1993, CTRC became an NCI-designated cancer center. Since 2007, CTRC has been a component of the UT Health Science Center at San Antonio.</p>
<p>The mission of CTRC is to conquer cancer through research, prevention and treatment. The CTRC is located in the center of a growing complex of clinical and science facilities at the UT Health Science Center. Working in disease-specific, multidisciplinary clinics, the more than 50 physician-members of the Center work with the staff to build a regimen of treatment for each patient in a convenient, one-stop approach.</p>
<p>The CRTC treats cancer in all its forms. Its physicians offer treatment at 10 disease-specific, multidisciplinary clinics:&nbsp;breast, gastrointestinal, gynecologic, genitourinary, geriatric, head and neck, hematologic/blood, neuro-oncology, sarcoma, and thoracic-pulmonary cancers. The Center offers its patients the full spectrum of clinical and support services to meet the medical, nutritional, and spiritual needs of the patient from diagnosis through treatment, rehabilitation, discharge and follow-up care. In providing care, the CTRC partners with several community hospitals.</p>
<p>CTRC accelerates the development of anticancer agents by integrating basic, translational, and clinical research on the UT campus. The IDD serves as the focal point for clinical trials, attracting patients from the community and beyond to join Phase I, II, and III studies.</p>
<p>Novel treatments under investigation at the Center include a new class of cancer drugs that are nontoxic to healthy cells. Investigators are also exploring ways to develop novel immune therapies that promise to be more selective for cancer with less damage to normal tissue.</p>
<p>CTRC also collaborates with the Barshop Institute for Longevity and Aging on investigations of ways to prolong life and reduce cancer development.</p>
<p>Cancer therapy at CTRC began with radiation therapy. Its use in treatment is enhanced through updated applications and radiation technologies. The CTRC currently has a focus across the spectrum of cancer care from prevention to detection to treatment, with major scientific discoveries in each of these areas. The CTRC-sponsored San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium attracts 9,000 physicians and scientists from around the world to San Antonio each December.</p>
<p>Throughout the CTRC, it is the collaboration among scientists, clinicians, and staff that both provides and advances the standard of care for cancer.</p>

<p>Founded in 1884 as the New York Cancer Hospital, Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) is one of the oldest cancer centers in the country. The hospital combined with the Sloan Kettering Institute in 1960 to form MSKCC. It was one of the first cancer centers to receive the NCI designation in 1971. As a Comprehensive Cancer Center, MSKCC provides patient care and conducts cancer research.</p>
<p>There is close collaboration between physicians and scientists at the Center. This enables its 804 hospital attending staff and 142 Sloan-Kettering Institute researchers to both deliver a high level of cancer care and enable the discovery and application of effective strategies to prevent, control, and provide treatment for cancer. MSKCC&rsquo;s experts have established standards of care and treatment protocols for each type and stage of cancer. A high degree of specialization means the Center&rsquo;s physicians treat more than 400 different subtypes of cancer.</p>
<p>At the same time, MSKCC offers a full range of programs to help patients and families throughout all phases of treatment, including support groups, genetic counseling, help in managing pain and symptoms, rehabilitation, integrative medical services, and assistance in navigating life after treatment.</p>
<p>Research conducted at the Center includes pioneering work in developing novel therapeutic regimens that have made possible remarkable progress in treating cancer. MSKCC physicians are currently leading more than 550 clinical trials for pediatric and adult cancers. The Center has been a leader in understanding the disease and developing new ways to diagnose and treat cancer. It has also made progress in understanding the biology of cancer through research programs in cancer biology and genetics, cell biology, computational biology, developmental biology, immunology, molecular biology, molecular pharmacology and chemistry, and structural biology.</p>
<p>MSKCC has initiated a series of training programs to prepare the next generation of physicians, scientists, and other health care professionals for leadership roles in the life sciences and medicine. The Gerstner Sloan-Kettering Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences at MSKCC was established in 2004 and offers a Ph.D. degree in cancer biology.</p>
<p>Ancillary facilities comprise a network of community-based, state-of-the-art cancer treatment sites. The Center has continued expanding its facilities since 2000 with the Zuckerman Research Center, the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center and MSKCC Imaging Center, the Brooklyn Infusion Center, and an Outpatient Rehabilitation Center.</p>
<p>MSKCC has made advances in a number of fields, including drug discovery, radiation therapy, and pediatrics. A program was created to treat children and young adults even with the rarest types of cancers. With the creation of the Pediatric Day Hospital, children predominantly receive their treatment in an outpatient setting, improving the quality of life for patients and families. In addition, a follow-up survivor program is available for adults and children.</p>

<p>Virginia Commonwealth University (VCU) Massey Cancer Center was founded in 1974 and received its NCI designation the following year. &nbsp;The mission of VCU Massey Cancer Center is to discover, develop and deliver effective means to prevent, detect, treat and ultimately cure cancer through innovative research, patient care and education.</p>
<p>Massey Cancer Center conducts cancer research at every level, including basic science, translational, clinical and population sciences research. Engaged in this research are more than 180 Massey research members, including scientists and physicians from 36 academic departments, six schools and one college at VCU. They collaborate on research in five key scientific programs: Cancer Cell Signaling, Cancer Molecular Genetics, Cancer Prevention and Control, Developmental Therapeutics, and Radiation Biology and Oncology. These programs are highly interdisciplinary and span across multiple cancer types.</p>
<p>Massey Cancer Center has a major strength in translational research, in which collaborations between laboratory scientists, population scientists and clinicians facilitate the translation and real-world application of research discoveries into improved patient care and advances in cancer prevention and control. &nbsp;These advances include the development of new drugs and new combinations of drugs, such as pemetrexed, a leading medication for lung cancers that a Massey researcher co-developed; neoadjuvant therapy (chemo before surgery), which Massey helped pioneer; new technologies, such as Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT), which Massey was the first in the nation to offer for delivery of high radiation doses to tumors while sparing surrounding normal tissue; new approaches to symptom management, such as Calmare pain therapy, which Massey was the first in the U.S. to test for the alleviation of pain; and cancer prevention interventions, such as Massey&rsquo;s discovery that simpler colonoscopies (ones without surgery to remove polyps) are safer.</p>
<p>A key part of the translational research cycle is developing and conducting clinical trials that test promising scientific breakthroughs, and Massey Cancer Center is a leader in Virginia offering more than 100 clinical trials for a variety of cancers. Massey also leads a statewide network for cancer clinical research that brings state-of-the-art clinical trials to patients in their own communities and emphasizes the inclusion of minorities in clinical trials. Massey is one of only 12 institutions in the nation to receive the type of NCI grant that supports this network that fosters access to cancer research for minority and medically underserved patients.</p>
<p>The inclusion of minorities in research is critical to broadening the applicability of the research and helping to reduce the health disparities prevalent in these populations. &nbsp;Massey Cancer Center is nationally recognized for its work in cancer disparities, studying the socioeconomic and cultural forces causing or contributing to disparities in cancer outcomes with a focus on both underserved minority populations and communities, and the medically indigent.</p>
<p>In addition to its research activities, Massey Cancer Center provides comprehensive, award-winning clinical oncology care, including a full range of medical and support services. Massey treats patients with all kinds of cancer, including rare and complex cancers. Both ambulatory and inpatient care are delivered at Massey at various sites across the state by multidisciplinary teams of disease-specific specialists to fully coordinate and personalize each patient&rsquo;s course of treatment. Massey is also an internationally recognized leader in palliative care, providing pain and symptom management as well as emotional, spiritual and psychological support for patients and their families.</p>

<p>The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (MD Anderson) was established by the Texas State Legislature in 1941and is a free-standing, degree-granting health institution within The University of Texas System. Mission areas include patient care, research, education, and prevention. &nbsp;In 1971 MD Anderson became one of the nation&rsquo;s first NCI-designated comprehensive cancer centers. MD Anderson&rsquo;s strength lies in its ability to rapidly translate scientific knowledge into improved cancer therapies and prevention strategies.</p>
<p>MD Anderson houses one of the largest, most developed cancer prevention programs in the nation, conducting research to assess and manage cancer risk through early detection, genetic counseling and clinical interventions, and implementing prevention programs that include genetic testing, chemoprevention, behavioral and nutritional counseling. Translational goals are to develop and deliver comprehensive evidence-based strategies to achieve a measurable lasting reduction in the cancer burden, especially among the underserved.</p>
<p>Cancer is the singular focus for MD Anderson&rsquo;s workforce of more than 19,000 employees with over 1,600 full-time faculty scholars who lead the largest number of NCI-funded grant programs and clinical trials of any institution in the nation. &nbsp;More than 6,500 trainees take part each year in educational programs, including advanced degrees at the Graduate School of Biomedical Science covering training from Cancer Biology to Clinical and Translational Science and bachelor&rsquo;s degrees in allied health disciplines. MD Anderson invested approximately $700 million in research (FY14) which is anticipated to increase with our cancer Moon Shots Program.</p>
<p>The multidisciplinary approach to treating cancer pioneered at MD Anderson brings together teams of experts across disciplines to collaborate on the best treatment plan for patients. A major focus is to increase access to quality cancer care worldwide. This mission is reflected by more than 122,000 patients annually from across the nation and the world who receive care in Houston and 114,000 patients receiving care through our local, national and international affiliations. &nbsp;The global outreach to drive science and improve care also includes academic collaborations with 30 sister institutions in 23 countries as well as the development of a decision support platform known as the MD Anderson Oncology Expert Advisor powered by cognitive computing. Advancing care for patients is also enabled by 800 interventional clinical trial protocols involving more than 12,000 patients each year, engaged in testing approximately one-third of all new FDA-approved cancer drugs. The Institute for Personalized Cancer Therapy and the immune therapy platform provide profiling for more precise patient care and innovative clinical trials.</p>
<p>A goal-oriented Moon Shots Program was launched in 2012 to dramatically accelerate the pace of converting scientific discoveries into clinical advances that would significantly reduce cancer deaths.

<p>Founded in 1984, the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (UPCI) was first designated as an NCI Comprehensive Cancer Center in 1990. UPCI seeks to accomplish its mission of reducing the burden of cancer in western Pennsylvania and the nation, through exceptional research, clinical care, education, and community outreach, through integrated programs in basic, clinical, translational, and population science research. The breadth of UPCI&rsquo;s cancer research focus spans from preventive strategies in healthy individuals, high-risk individuals, and individuals with precancerous lesions, to issues affecting long-term cancer survivors and end-of-life care.</p>
<p>UPCI has 320 faculty members from 42 University departments. Many are based at the Hillman Cancer Center &ndash; a state-of-the-art facility opened in 2002, which supports side-by-side performance of laboratory research, clinical research, routine clinical care, and population sciences program administration, for maximum efficiency and patient benefit. &nbsp;Each UPCI member is assigned to a research program that focuses on one of the following topic areas: molecular and cellular cancer biology, cancer immunology, cancer virology, cancer therapeutics, head and neck cancer, lung cancer, melanoma, biobehavioral oncology, cancer epidemiology and prevention, and breast and ovarian cancer. The research programs are strengthened through UPCI&rsquo;s three Specialized Program of Research Excellence (SPORE) awards (lung, head and neck, and melanoma and skin cancer) and a recent fourth joint SPORE award with Roswell Park Cancer Institute (ovarian cancer). &nbsp;</p>
<p>UPCI provides its members with 13 shared resources for accessing cutting-edge equipment, technologies, and expertise. Included are capabilities for: sequencing genomic DNA and identifying proteins through mass spectrometry; imaging the location and function of specific molecules in tissues and single living cells; manufacturing cellular and virus-based therapies for use in clinical trials; and imaging tumors and therapy response, in small animals and patients enrolled on clinical trials. UPCI also sponsors a variety of activities, throughout the year, that promote collaboration across research programs and disciplines. The education and training opportunities made available through UPCI, and its partnerships with UPMC and the University of Pittsburgh, span the career-level continuum from providing high school and undergraduate students (including those from minority and other groups under-represented in the biomedical work force) with a summer research experience, to providing senior investigators and practicing oncology professionals with opportunities to update their knowledge and learn new clinical skills, while earning continuing education credits.</p>
<p>Through UPCI, more than 300 ongoing clinical trials are available to patients at UPMC CancerCenter&rsquo;s four flagship hospitals (including Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC) and 33 community network sites, which are located throughout 29 western Pennsylvania counties. These include: large, late-phase trials sponsored by the NCI&rsquo;s National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) for which UPCI is a Lead Academic Participating Site; early-phase trials sponsored by the NCI&rsquo;s Experimental Therapeutics-Clinical Trials Network (ET-CTN) for which UPCI is a Lead Academic Organization; and early-phase institutional trials, designed and sponsored by UPCI investigators, to test new therapies (including those discovered at UPCI) and therapy combinations.</p>
<p>The web-based Clinical Pathways system has been implemented to ensure consistent patient care throughout the large UPMC CancerCenter network, and inform clinicians of specific ongoing trials that could benefit individual patients. Through UPMC&rsquo;s Molecular Genomic Pathology Laboratory, UPMC CancerCenter patients are able to receive personalized cancer treatment and participate in genome-driven trials of new targeted therapies.</p>

<p>St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital was founded in 1962. The Cancer Center received its NCI designation in 1977 and was awarded status as a comprehensive cancer center by NCI in 2008. The hospital&rsquo;s mission is to advance cures and means of prevention for pediatric catastrophic diseases through research and treatment.</p>
<p>St. Jude has a staff of more than 4,000, including over 160 researchers who are part of the Cancer Center. They are engaged in a broad spectrum of research, including discovery-oriented basic science research, the investigation of disease pathogenesis and drug resistance, biobehavioral and quality-of-life research, and therapeutic trials.</p>
<p>The Cancer Center supports five major interdisciplinary research programs that are organized with the specific intent of translating basic science discoveries into curative therapies for children with cancer, while minimizing long-term side effects. &nbsp;Our three disease-oriented programs focus on Developmental Biology and Solid Tumors, Hematological Malignancies, and Neurobiology and Brain Tumors; our Cancer Prevention and Control Program strives to improve the quality of life of individuals surviving childhood cancer; and our Cancer Genetics, Biochemistry and Cell Biology Program embeds basic cancer research within the heart of the center, facilitating direct interaction between the disease-oriented Programs and the major laboratory resources in the Center.</p>
<p>The department of Chemical Biology and Therapeutics at St. Jude provides the Center with advanced high-throughput drug screening and chemistry capabilities and our Pediatric Cancer Genome Project, a joint research initiative in pediatric cancer between St. Jude and the Genome Center of Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri has decoded the complete genomes of more than 700 childhood cancer patients.</p>
<p>The children who are accepted for cancer treatment at St. Jude are treated on disease-specific frontline protocols developed by Cancer Center investigators. The hospital also accepts children who have already been treated elsewhere and are eligible for transplantation, relapse, or Phase I or II clinical trials. Several major multi-institutional studies are centered at St. Jude, including the NCI-funded Childhood Cancer Survivors Study and the Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium. &nbsp;The St. Jude LIFE study is recruiting more than 4,000 alumni cancer survivors who were treated at the hospital to return for on-campus, clinical evaluations, every year, for life. The objectives of St. Jude LIFE are to describe the occurrence and timing of selected late effects as the age increases for the survivor population, as well as to identify treatment, genetic, demographic, behavioral and psychosocial related predictors.</p>
<p>Education programs at St. Jude include lectures, symposiums and the preparation of curriculum for the local pediatric practitioner community. Residents and students are part of the fabric of life at St. Jude. Outreach programs range from the local community to international partnerships, such as St. Jude Global, a major expansion of the former St. Jude International Outreach Program, a strategic initiative led by the St. Jude Department of Global Pediatric Medicine. St. Jude Global actively fosters the development of regional networks among our international partners and collaborators. This model of outreach moves beyond our successful one-on-one partnership approach by promoting self-sufficiency and the sharing of expertise among international sites. Through this model, we aim to accelerate global improvements in the clinical care of children with cancer and other life-threatening diseases.</p>

<p>The University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCC) traces its origins to 1965, when NCI created an off-campus intramural program in the Division of Cancer Treatment at NCI and located it in the U.S. Public Health Service Hospital (USPHS) in Baltimore. After the USPHS hospitals were closed in 1974, the program was transferred to the University of Maryland. In 1982, the program was moved from a public to a private facility and renamed the University of Maryland Cancer Center, changing in 1996 to the UMGCC. The Center received its NCI designation in 2008.</p>
<p>The mission of the UMGCC is to conduct innovative basic and clinical research that will impact the understanding and treatment of cancer around the world and to provide state-of-the-art clinical care to cancer patients in Maryland and beyond. Clinical and research facilities are located on the UM medical campus in downtown Baltimore. The bridge that connects the clinical area of the hospital to the research laboratories in the UM School of Medicine Bressler Research Building illustrates the connection between the research scientists and clinicians giving patients care. The Center&rsquo;s membership includes more than 270 faculty for research and patient care.</p>
<p>The comprehensive research programs at UMGCC include: Experimental Therapeutics, Hormone Responsive Cancers, Molecular and Structural Biology, Population Science, and Tumor Immunology and Immunotherapy. Research is conducted at the UM School of Medicine and in the Medical Center laboratories, with clinical research taking place through patient interactions within the Medical Center's inpatient and outpatient facilities.</p>
<p>The goal of the UMGCC&rsquo;s interactive, multidisciplinary research program&mdash;consisting of both clinical and basic researchers&mdash;is to take advantage of discoveries in basic cancer biology and in the research programs in order to develop and apply innovative cancer treatment and prevention strategies. Researchers seek to describe the molecular mechanisms underlying specific clinical phenotypes and behaviors and apply these discoveries and strategies to the Maryland population and others, with a specific focus on cancer disparities.</p>
<p>The Center serves an inner city population with significant minority representation. In its emphasis on health disparities, UMGCC seeks to understand the basis for differences in cancer incidence, response, and survival in different populations. In addition to these studies of health disparities, another priority of the UMGCC is to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in clinical trials, achieving a current participation rate of 30 percent.</p>
<p>The Center has comprehensive treatment programs for all types of cancer, each staffed by a multidisciplinary team of experts to care for the needs of each patient. There is a wide range of support services for patients, ranging from genetic and nutrition counseling to the Image Renewal Center. Both patients and their families are the focus of UMGCC&rsquo;s education programs.</p>

<p>The Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Chapel Hill received NCI-designation in 1975, becoming a comprehensive cancer center in 1990. With research that spans from the laboratory to the bedside to the community, UNC Lineberger works to understand the causes of cancer at both the genetic and environmental level, to conduct groundbreaking research and to translate that research into innovative treatment and prevention measures. &nbsp;UNC Lineberger&rsquo;s 301 members are drawn from more than 40 departments at UNC, including the School of Medicine, the Gillings School of Global Public Health, the Eshelman School of Pharmacy, the School of Dentistry, the School of Nursing, and the College of Arts and Sciences.</p>
<p>The Center conducts interdisciplinary research through nine programs: cancer cell biology, immunology, molecular therapeutics, virology, cancer genetics, clinical research, breast cancer, cancer prevention and control, and cancer epidemiology.</p>
<p>UNC Lineberger&rsquo;s emphasis on breast cancer research includes studies of molecular phenotypes and pathogenesis, particularly in those patients with the worst prognosis. These basic biological investigations are linked to the Center&rsquo;s work on population studies, particularly within the African-American community.<br />UNC&rsquo;s chemists, physicists, oncologists, and drug discovery scientists come together in the Carolina Center of Cancer Nanotechnology Excellence (CCNE), an NCI-funded multidisciplinary center. Scientists at CCNE are utilizing innovative and cutting edge nanotechnologies, such as PRINT (Particle Replication on Non-Wetting Templates) nanoparticles and carbon-nanotube-based x-ray sources, to enhance treatment and early detection of lung, brain and breast cancer.</p>
<p>UNC Lineberger also works collaboratively with the UNC Eshelman School of Pharmacy through the Center for Integrative Chemical Biology and Drug Discovery to develop novel small-molecule anti-neoplastics. Projects include potential treatments for renal cell carcinoma, basal-like breast cancer, pediatric leukemia and glioma.</p>
<p>UNC Lineberger has an extensive array of pre-clinical infrastructure. UNC is the repository for the Collaborative Cross, an international effort investigating the genetic and environmental factors that contribute to cancer susceptibility in mouse models. UNC Lineberger also houses the Mouse Phase I Unit, which performs pre-clinical efficacy testing of novel therapeutics from industry and academia in state-of-the-art mouse models of cancer.</p>
<p>UNC Lineberger is a driving force of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a multi-institutional, NCI-funded effort to molecularly characterize several thousand human cancer samples. Work at UNC on TCGA has transformed the understanding of several common cancers including those of the breast, kidney, oropharynx, skin, lung and brain.</p>
<p>The Center is also building population-based data resources to improve cancer prevention and early detection. One powerful resource is the Integrated Cancer Information and Surveillance System (ICISS), a system linking metrics of cancer incidence, mortality, and burden in North Carolina to describe health care, economic, medical claims, social, behavioral, and environmental patterns.</p>
<p>UNC Lineberger offers patient-centered care provided by UNC&rsquo;s nationally-known clinical faculty, and offers clinical trials across the state, giving North Carolina patients access to leading-edge treatments. The N.C. Cancer Hospital is the flagship site for UNC Cancer Care and the clinical home of UNC Lineberger. The state&rsquo;s only public cancer hospital, the 315,000-square-foot facility includes multidisciplinary clinic space with a healing atmosphere created with patient input along with a nationally recognized Comprehensive Cancer Support Program.<br />&nbsp;</p>

<p>The University of Virginia (UVA) Cancer Center was founded in 1984 and received its NCI designation in 1987.&nbsp;The Center&rsquo;s vision is of a collaborative approach to basic and translational research coupled with the delivery of multi-specialty, patient-centered care.</p>
<p>The special mission of the Center is to identify new frontiers of knowledge that can be brought to bear in the fight against cancer. UVA has a long tradition of discovery research in cancer cell regulation, especially in the area of signal transduction.&nbsp;To that end, the Center has fostered partnerships between molecular pharmacologists and tumor virologists, which spearheaded the creation of the cancer cell signaling field. The Center has worked with the private sector to translate discoveries into useful tools for cancer care.</p>
<p>The Center draws more than 130 researchers from 22 different academic departments. UVA&rsquo;s research activities are organized around five programs that combine a foundation of basic science with translational or clinical components: Chemical and Structural Biology, Molecular Genetics and Epigenetics, Cancer Cell Signaling, Women&rsquo;s Oncology, and Cancer Immunology and Immunotherapy.</p>
<p>Over the past decade, the Center has expanded from its core expertise in cell and molecular biology into the physical and quantitative sciences, including collaborations with biomedical engineers and structural biologists. UVA has developed basic programs in endocrinology and immunology into translational programs in women&rsquo;s oncology and immunology/immunotherapy. Other partnerships have been established with behavioral investigators, particularly in the School of Nursing.</p>
<p>Consonant with these productive partnerships are UVA&rsquo;s early clinical trials of targeted agents and immunotherapies. The Center also plays a leadership role in cooperative group trials in gynecologic oncology, neuro-oncology, and hematologic malignancies.</p>
<p>Inter-institutional collaboration is woven into the fabric of the Center&rsquo;s work. UVA is the lead institution in an NIH-funded program of 23 institutions worldwide working to understand the fundamental mechanisms that control cell movement, a key to understanding and controlling the invasion and metastasis that is often the lethal event in cancer. UVA is also involved in the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project, providing high quality tissue samples from hundreds of subjects. The Center is one of eight international centers in the ENCODE consortium to functionally annotate 1 percent of the human genome.</p>
<p>Since the Center is located in a largely rural area, it has a broad geographic reach. This extends as far as the Appalachian regions of southwest Virginia, where the Center leads the Healthy Appalachia initiative &ndash; with network hospitals and clinics, telemedicine, mobile digital mammography, and dedicated nurse navigators.&nbsp;UVA engages in partnerships to overcome both health disparities and the economic disparities that underlie them.</p>

<p>Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center was established in 1993 and became an NCI-designated cancer center in 1995. The Center was awarded status as a comprehensive cancer center in 2001. Vanderbilt-Ingram has more than 280 members devoted to conducting research and providing care for both adult and pediatric cancers.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt-Ingram&rsquo;s mission is to alleviate cancer death and suffering through pioneering research, innovative patient-centered care, and evidence-based prevention, education and community initiatives. Central to achieving these goals are the Center&rsquo;s thematically-organized research programs, which span the spectrum of scientific endeavors &ndash; from basic science to clinical and population-based research:<br />&bull; Breast Cancer<br />&bull; Cancer Epidemiology<br />&bull; Cancer Health Outcomes and Control<br />&bull; Gastrointestinal Cancer<br />&bull; Genome Maintenance<br />&bull; Host-Tumor Interactions<br />&bull; Signal Transduction and Chemical Biology<br />&bull; Translational Research and Interventional Oncology</p>
<p>Major research priorities for Vanderbilt-Ingram include:<br />&bull; Conducting cutting-edge basic science and translating the resulting discoveries into the clinic<br />&bull; Identifying individuals and populations at high risk of cancer and developing interventions to lower this risk<br />&bull; Advancing molecularly-based diagnosis and treatment for cancers<br />&bull; Analyzing health care outcomes to inform clinical decision-making<br />&bull; Understanding and meeting the medical, physical, psycho-social, cognitive, and other needs of a rapidly growing population of cancer survivors</p>
<p>A hallmark of the Center is a strong collegial culture that fosters extensive research collaborations. The Center&rsquo;s partners at Vanderbilt University include the Vanderbilt Institute of Chemical Biology, the Vanderbilt University Institute of Imaging Science, and the Monroe Carell Jr. Children&rsquo;s Hospital.</p>
<p>Vanderbilt-Ingram&rsquo;s commitment to community outreach is exemplified by a long-standing partnership with historically black institutions Meharry Medical College and Tennessee State University, as part of the Meharry-Vanderbilt Alliance. This collaboration focuses on reducing health disparities by: increasing access to care and clinical trials among the underserved; providing support and mentoring students, trainees, and young scientists from underrepresented groups; and conducting research to reduce the burden of cancer among minorities and the underserved.</p>
<p>Another major program is the Southern Community Cohort Study (SCCS), an NCI-funded initiative of Vanderbilt, Meharry, and dozens of federally funded community health centers in the southeastern United States. The SCCS is enrolling and following approximately 90,000 people&mdash;two-thirds of them African American&mdash;with the goal of understanding and addressing why African Americans and people in this region face a higher burden of cancer than other groups and regions in the nation.</p>
<p>To address the growing need for cancer care in the region, Vanderbilt-Ingram continues to develop partnerships with community health care providers throughout Tennessee to bring the Center&rsquo;s expertise and quality of care to more communities across the region.</p>

<p>The Case Comprehensive Cancer Center (Case CCC) at Case Western Reserve University was both founded and became an NCI-designated cancer center in 1987. It was recognized as an NCI-designated comprehensive cancer center 11 years later. In 2004, the institutional and membership base from the founding partnership between Case Western Reserve and Ireland Cancer Center of University Hospitals (UH) expanded to include the Cleveland Clinic. Cancer research and care at these three institutions are now unified under the leadership of the Case CCC. In addition, the freestanding cancer hospital at UH, the Jane and Lee Seidman Cancer Center, open in Spring 2011.</p>
<p>The mission of the Case CCC is fourfold. The first goal is to improve the prevention, diagnosis, and therapy of cancer through discovery, evaluation, and dissemination. The second goal is to stimulate and support innovative, coordinated interdisciplinary clinical research on cancer diagnosis, treatment, prevention, and control. The third objective is to develop clinical applications of discovery and make these available to northern Ohio residents as quickly as possible through the integrated efforts of the major health systems in the region. The fourth goal is to develop cancer prevention and control activities that build on the expertise of the Center and result in a reduction of cancer morbidity and mortality in the northern Ohio region and throughout the nation.</p>

<p>The Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center is a leading academic cancer research center in the United States. It is located in Indianapolis on the IU School of Medicine campus.<br />Established in 1992 as the Indiana University (IU) Cancer Center, the IU center became an NCI-designated cancer center in 1999. The center was renamed the Indiana University Melvin and Bren Simon Cancer Center in 2006.</p>
<p>Its mission is to decrease the mortality and suffering from cancer by conducting outstanding translational research, providing excellence in education, and by delivering high quality patient-centered care. With an intent of delivering its services to all Hoosiers, the center&rsquo;s researchers and physicians are also focused &nbsp;on improving the health and well-being of racial, ethnic, and rural area populations in Indiana by establishing strong relationships with key organizations and leaders in diverse and underserved communities.</p>
<p>A partnership between the IU School of Medicine and Indiana University Health, the center has more &nbsp;than 200 research members, including basic, clinical, and population science investigators. The researchers work collaboratively with the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research and the Harper Cancer Research Institute, a partnership between the IU School of Medicine and the University of Notre Dame.</p>
<p>The scientists conduct research in five different programs. The goals of those programs range from understanding the molecular changes that cause cancer to the development of targeted therapies to prevent and treat cancer.</p>
<p>The center&rsquo;s physician scientists have made protocol-defining discoveries that have changed the way doctors treat testicular cancer, breast cancer, gastrointestinal cancer, genitourinary cancer, leukemia, multiple myeloma, thymoma and thymic carcinomas, and thoracic cancers. IU Simon Cancer Center physicians at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health and IU Health University Hospital are recognized nationally for their bone marrow and stem cell transplantation programs.</p>
<p>Through a partnership with IU Health, cancer patients benefit from the scientific discoveries made at the IU Simon Cancer Center. The center&rsquo;s patient care building brings together a multidisciplinary team for patients that combines treatment, research, and supportive care in a manner that is individualized for each person.</p>
<p>Many patients come to the IU Simon Cancer Center because of clinical trials that are available only here. The IU Simon Cancer Center offers more than 700 adult and pediatric clinical trials. And because of the reach of the Hoosier Cancer Research Network, the community outreach arm of the center, every Hoosier is within 60 miles of a clinical research site. A model for community-academic partnerships, the Hoosier Cancer Research Network, formerly Hoosier Oncology Group, offers ease of access to clinical studies for patients in rural parts of the state so they can receive their treatments close to their homes.</p>
<p>Also of note, the Susan G. Komen Tissue Bank at the IU Simon Cancer Center &ndash; the first and only such bank -- collects breast tissue samples from women without breast cancer. By collecting samples from women without breast cancer, researchers may be able to determine the differences between healthy and cancerous tissue, which will lead to a better understanding of the cellular changes of the disease. The bank&rsquo;s samples are available to researchers around the world.</p>
<p>On the global stage, the center works with the IU School of Medicine-Kenya Partnership to deliver prevention, treatment and palliative care for cancer patients at the Moi Teaching Referral Hospital in western Kenya.</p>
<p>As for the future, the center&rsquo;s members serve as teachers to the next generation of physicians and researchers. As educators, the research members teach nearly 2,000 students, residents, and fellows each year. Overall, the center offers training programs for students ranging from high-school students to postgraduates.</p>

<p>The Ohio State University Cancer Research Center was established in 1973 and received National Cancer Institute designation in April 1976 as a comprehensive cancer center (OSUCCC). The patient care arm of the OSUCCC is the Arthur G. James Cancer Hospital and Richard J. Solove Research Institute. The center is known as the OSUCCC &ndash; James.</p>
<p>The OSUCCC &ndash; James is a founding member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), an alliance of 21 leading cancer centers that develops clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of care.</p>
<p>The OSUCCC &ndash; James comprises five interactive cancer research programs: Cancer Control, Leukemia, Molecular Biology and Cancer Genetics, Molecular Carcinogenesis and Chemoprevention and Translational Therapeutics. Engaged in this research are more than 300 center members from 12 of the 14 colleges at Ohio State and affiliated academic institutions, including scientists and physicians from multiple specialties. Their work contributes to the center&rsquo;s larger mission to eradicate cancer from individuals&rsquo; lives by generating knowledge and integrating groundbreaking research with excellence in education and patient-centered care.</p>
<p>Within the James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute, the OSUCCC &ndash; James can rapidly translate the latest cancer research discoveries to innovative cancer care and prevention strategies. A multidisciplinary, high-technology and multimodality approach to cancer care includes disease site groups with surgical oncologists, medical oncologists, pathologists, radiologists, radiation oncologists, researchers and other experts collaborating to provide the latest in cancer diagnosis, treatment and prevention.</p>
<p>In December 2014, the OSUCCC &ndash; James opened a new James Cancer Hospital and Solove Research Institute. With 21 floors, 1.1 million square feet and 306 beds in private rooms, the new James ranks as the third-largest cancer hospital in the nation &ndash; a transformational facility that is designed to integrate researchers, clinicians and educators more closely than ever before and enhance science-based patient care.</p>
<p>The hospital includes a 36-bed blood and marrow transplant unit, inpatient units in which sub-specialists focus on just one type of cancer, a cancer clinical trials unit, 14 state-of-the-art operating rooms, six interventional radiology suites, special isolation rooms, chemotherapy and transfusion areas, seven linear accelerators for radiation therapy, an above-ground radiation oncology department that enables patients to benefit from the calming and healing effects of natural light and a fully integrated cancer emergency department for treating cancer-related medical emergencies.</p>
<p>This concentration of cancer research and care has led the OSUCCC &ndash; James to become one of only a few cancer centers awarded contracts by the NCI to conduct both phase I and phase II clinical trials on new NCI-sponsored anticancer drugs. Those trials take place in inpatient and outpatient facilities at the center.</p>
<p>Ambulatory patients access services from a variety of outpatient facilities on campus and across central Ohio. Among the many locations, Ohio State&rsquo;s Stefanie Spielman Comprehensive Breast Center, which opened in 2011, provides the full spectrum of breast care and other women-focused oncology programs. Overall, the OSUCCC &ndash; James has more than 1.5 million square feet of clinical and research space to facilitate the translation of discovery to treatment.</p>
<p>Finally, the OSUCCC &ndash; James&rsquo; outreach to underserved populations includes its work with the Appalachia Community Cancer Network and an effort by the Centers for Population Health and Health Disparities to understand the reasons for high rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality in Appalachian Ohio.</p>

In 1973, the University started the University of Wisconsin Clinical Cancer Center. They were combined as the University of Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Center and received their NCI designation in 1973. The Center was renamed the UW Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC) in 2006.</p><p>The UWCCC is an integral part of the UW School of Medicine and Public Health and brings together more than 280 physicians and scientists from 55 departments and nine schools to conduct research and translate laboratory discoveries into new patient treatments. Much of the research is conducted in the Wisconsin Institutes for Medical Research Building, while clinical care is provided at the UW Hospital and Clinics.</p><p>Research scientists, academic faculty, and clinicians work together across eight research programs: cancer control, cancer genetics, chemoprevention, experimental therapeutics, human cancer virology, imaging and radiation sciences, nuclear signaling, and tumor microenvironment. The teamwork exemplified in these programs has led to other significant collaborations within the local community that focus on research, community outreach, clinical trial accrual, and work with underserved populations.</p><p>The Wisconsin Oncology Network, for example, is a regional network established to allow community health centers from throughout Wisconsin and northern Illinois to enroll patients in select cancer clinical trials that are open at the UWCCC. The Wisconsin Network for Health Research is another collaborative research partnership which promotes the discovery and application of scientific knowledge for researchers throughout the state.</p><p>Several collaborations fall in the area of cancer prevention and control. The UW Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention (UW-CTRI) takes a leadership role in reducing the burden of illness and death from tobacco use. Researchers in this program seek to expand understanding of tobacco dependence and its treatment, as well as to design interventions that will significantly reduce tobacco use. UWCCC is also part of the Wisconsin Comprehensive Cancer Control Program, a community-based program established by the state to develop a Comprehensive Cancer Control Plan 2010-2015. The program is guided by the Wisconsin Cancer Council, a coalition of 75 statewide, regional, and local organizations.</p><p>One of two significant minority outreach programs at UWCCC is the Partnerships with Underserved/Minority Populations, a project using community-based participatory research principles. The project is studying community readiness for change and undertaking an assessment of quality cancer care in eight underserved communities, including African Americans, Latinos, Hmong, American Indians, Amish, and the rural poor. The second outreach program, called the Spirit of Eagles, addresses comprehensive cancer control through partnerships with American Indian tribes and other entities throughout the upper Midwest.</p><p><em>* This profile was provided by the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center.</em></p></div>]]></body>

<p>The Wake Forest University (WFU) School of Medicine was founded in 1902 and North Carolina Baptist Hospital opened in 1923. It has grown into a large academic medical center with 900 faculty members, more than 100 buildings on 290 acres, and 900 licensed beds. The Comprehensive Cancer Center of Wake Forest University (CCCWFU) started in the early 1960&rsquo;s and became an NCI-designated cancer center in 1972 and a comprehensive center in 1990.</p>
<p>The mission of the Cancer Center is to improve the lives of cancer patients by focusing basic, clinical, and population sciences on the problems of cancer prevention, early diagnosis, and novel treatment. The membership of CCCWFU is comprised of more than 125 faculty members from 34 departments. The Center&rsquo;s research is divided into four programs: Cell Growth and Survival, Cellular Damage and Defense, Clinical Research, and Cancer Prevention and Control. To facilitate the scientific and translational goals of the programs, the CCCWFU has established three Centers of Excellence in brain, breast, and prostate cancer.</p>
<p>The CCCWFU recognizes the importance of building cross-departmental and trans-disciplinary team approaches to advance the science and treatment of cancer. Teams have been developed in cancer genomics, the tumor microenvironment, nanotechnology, imaging, novel anticancer drugs and devices, cancer survivorship, tobacco control, and cancer health disparities. Collaborations with other centers and schools within the institution are an essential element to the success of this research. The Cancer Center has strong connections with the Wake Forest Institute of Regenerative Medicine, the Center for Genomics and Personalized Medicine, the Wake Forest University Departments of Physics and Chemistry, and the Virginia Tech-Wake Forest University School of Biomedical Engineering and Sciences.</p>
<p>The Center is the main tertiary referral center for patients in a large geographic region. The CCCWFU provides a multidisciplinary approach to treatment in a state-of-the-art facility. A six-story expansion of the Cancer Center opened in December 2013. The new portion of the building contains acute care oncology inpatient beds and an oncology intensive care unit, in addition to the existing floors which house all outpatient oncology services. This new building provides an exceptional environment for patients, family and caregiver experience. &nbsp;Cutting-edge research and precision medicine is available to all patients who have access to approximately 200 clinical trials.</p>
<p>The CCCWFU was founded with a strong community orientation and continues this tradition by addressing cancer issues that are important to the region&rsquo;s large contingents of African Americans, Latinos, Native Americans, rural poor, and pockets of urban poor. The Center works very closely with the Maya Angelou Center for Health Equity at WFU, which was founded by the renowned poet to address health disparities across the region and the nation.</p>

<p>The University of Colorado Cancer Center at the Anschutz Medical Campus received NCI designation in1988 and became a comprehensive cancer center in 1997.</p>
<p>The CU Cancer Center is the hub of cancer research in Colorado. It is a consortium of three universities and three institutions: University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Colorado State University, University of Colorado Boulder, University of Colorado Hospital, Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado, and Denver Veteran&rsquo;s Administration Medical Center. The more than 400 members are working toward one goal: translating science into life.</p>
<p>CU Cancer Center&rsquo;s clinical partner University of Colorado Hospital is ranked 15th by US News and World Report for Cancer and the CU Cancer Center is a member of the prestigious National Comprehensive Cancer Network&reg;, an alliance of the nation&rsquo;s leading cancer centers working to establish and deliver the gold standard in cancer clinical guidelines.</p>
<p>Working collaboratively, CU Cancer Center members discover, develop, and deliver breakthroughs that improve cancer care for people and companion animals. The Center focuses on interdisciplinary research conducted in six programs: Cancer Prevention and Control, Cancer Cell Biology, Developmental Therapeutics, Hormone Related Malignancies, Molecular Oncology, and Lung/Head and Neck Cancer.</p>
<p>Basic scientists at CU Cancer Center strive to understand better the fundamental biological activity that leads to cancer. They work closely with clinical researchers to translate laboratory findings into drugs, therapies, and techniques that can be applied to patients. Clinical researchers then enroll patients in clinical trials to test these new treatments in cancer research studies. The results of this collaboration are promising new techniques to diagnose, treat, and prevent cancer.</p>
<p>The CU Cancer Center is a leader in identifying new targets for cancer therapies and then creating or matching the proper therapeutic agents. It also is the coordinating center for the Lung Cancer Mutation Consortium, a national initiative to examine non-small cell lung cancer tumors and match patients to the best possible therapies.</p>
<p>Another focus of the Center is cancer survivorship. CU is home to three unique cancer survivorship clinics for the region: the HOPE clinic for young adult survivors of cancer at Children&rsquo;s Hospital Colorado; the TACTIC clinic for adult survivors of childhood cancer at the University of Colorado Hospital; and the THRIVE clinic for transitioning adult cancer patients back to primary care.</p>
<p>Outreach also is an important component of the work at the Center, with the Colorado Colorectal Screening Program for uninsured state citizens as just one example. The Center also conducts a wide range of clinical trials in both people and companion animals, especially dogs, through the Flint Animal Cancer Center at CSU. Clinical trials in dogs have led to new treatments for people.</p>
<p>CU Cancer Center physicians also travel across the state of Colorado to see patients and bring clinical trials to outlying areas of the state. Hospital affiliates of the Center around the state facilitate and collaborate in this work. The Center also offers educational opportunities for professionals, students, and the public.</p>

<p>New Mexico is a beautiful and vast geographic region of the southwestern United States with rich multiethnic diversity, tremendous scientific opportunity, and challenging health and socioeconomic disparities. Since first achieving National Cancer Institute Designation in 2005, the University of New Mexico Cancer Center (UNMCC) and its Consortium Institutions - Lovelace Respiratory Research Institute, Los Alamos National Laboratory, and Sandia National Laboratories – have built a single transdisciplinary cancer-focused research enterprise and statewide networks for cancer care delivery and community participatory research. As the only NCI Designated Cancer Center within a 500 mile radius, the special characteristics of the UNMCC include: the multiethnic and geographically dispersed populations that it serves - primarily Hispanic/Latino, American Indian, and non-Hispanic White - with strikingly different patterns of cancer incidence, mortality, and disparity; the integration of regional scientific strengths into its Research Programs and Shared Resources; statewide registries and community partnerships that facilitate screening, prevention, and intervention research; and a statewide cancer clinical trials network, supported in part by the NCI NCTN NCORP program, that includes all New Mexico community based oncologists collaborating with those at the UNMCC. The UNMCC mission is to focus its scientific and clinical expertise and interdisciplinary training programs on those cancers that have high incidence, mortality, or disparity in the multiethnic and underserved populations of New Mexico, and, to translate discoveries to interventions that reduce the cancer burden in New Mexico and the nation. With extensive program planning, evaluation, and recruitment, the UNMCC has significantly built is programs, creating 15 Endowed Positions. The Center’s 125 Members are clustered in 4 interdisciplinary, highly translational Research Programs: Cancer Control; Cancer Genetics, Epigenetics, &#38; Genomics; Translational Cancer Biology &#38; Signaling; and Cancer Therapeutics: Technology, Discovery, &#38; Targeted Delivery that are highly interactive (with overall collaborative publications ranging from 30-52%), producing high quality science (with &#62;15% of &#160;publications in high impact journals). Since 2010, total peer-reviewed and total annual research funding increased 33%. Since 2010, UNMCC members were issued 33 U.S. patents (117 pending) and started 11 new cancer-focused startup companies. Transdisciplinary research also increased markedly with the awarding of 15 new large interdisciplinary, multi-investigator, programmatic grants. UNMCC science was translated to 10 investigator-initiated clinical trials, 3 funded by NCI and DOD, and several new trials are in development. On average, 16.6% of the Center’s annual newly diagnosed and/or treated patients were accrued to therapeutic trials; 43% of the Center’s therapeutic and 70% of non-interventional accruals are racial and ethnic minorities.</p>

<p>Founded in 1913, City of Hope began focusing on cancer research and treatment in the late 1940s. Receiving its NCI designation in 1981 and its designation as a comprehensive cancer center in 1998, City of Hope is today a biomedical research, treatment, and education center.</p>
<p>The Center&rsquo;s more than 200 physicians and scientists are dedicated to developing innovative, disease-fighting strategies in the battle against cancer. In this multidisciplinary, interactive environment, basic, clinical, translational, and prevention and control scientists work closely together. Their work is a continuum, starting with research on the biomedical mechanisms of cancer genesis and progression, moving on to the development of new therapies, testing those treatments in clinical trials, and, finally, delivering the best in patient care and providing support and education to patients, their families, and the public. That work contributes to further understanding of cancer risk assessment and prevention. Examples of the basic research findings developed at City of Hope are recombinant DNA technology and monoclonal antibodies and these discoveries were then applied to therapy.</p>
<p>City of Hope houses the National Medical Center, Beckman Research Institute, City of Hope Medical Foundation and the Irell &amp; Manella Graduate School of Biological Sciences. Major facilities include City of Hope Helford Clinical Research Hospital and the Center for Biomedicine &amp; Genetics, a manufacturing facility specializing in the production of pharmaceutical materials. Some of the cancers researched and treated at City of Hope include hematologic malignancies and solid tumors including breast, genitourinary/prostate, thoracic/lung, gastrointestinal/liver, musculoskeletal, gynecological, and brain cancers, as well as several pediatric cancers.</p>
<p>There are three major areas of research at the Center. The Cancer Biology program conducts basic laboratory research, contributing to understanding the underlying genetic, molecular, and biological bases of cancer. City of Hope&rsquo;s clinical and translational research area consists of Developmental Cancer Therapeutics, Cancer Immunotherapeutics, and Hematologic Malignancies. These programs translate laboratory observations into patient treatments.</p>
<p>The third area encompasses the Center&rsquo;s Cancer Control and Population Sciences program. It includes a broad spectrum of disciplines and is complemented by collaborations with physician investigators. This program focuses on four areas of concentration: host and environmental determinants of cancer; health-related outcomes and quality-of-life after cancer; interventional studies to reduce cancer-related morbidity; and educational initiatives.</p>
<p>Frequent interactions among investigators in the various City of Hope research programs result in shared insights. The research flow is circular, moving from prevention and basic discovery to treatment and providing insights back to basic and preventive research. These interrelated studies often link to Phase I and II clinical trials. They also are part of follow-up studies in survivorship and symptom management.</p>
<p>City of Hope collaborates with numerous other institutions through the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, the Blood and Marrow Transplant Clinical Trials Network, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group, the Southwest Oncology Group, the Clinical Trials Consortium, the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group, and the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group.</p>

<p>The Cancer Center at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies was established in 1970 and received its NCI designation in 1973. Today, the Cancer Center includes 29 faculty members, 184 postdoctoral researchers, 27 staff researchers and 27 graduate students. It accounts for about half of the Institute&rsquo;s research.</p>
<p>Research at the Center is aimed at understanding fundamental aspects of biology related to cancer with the ultimate goal of reducing cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality. The work of the Center is based on the philosophy that basic research in molecular, cellular, and developmental biology has the power to illuminate underlying causes of cancer, often in unexpected ways.</p>
<p>The interactive research at Salk often produces significant insights into basic mechanisms of cell growth regulation underlying cancer. Salk&rsquo;s collaborative research is organized under three major programs: Metabolism and Cancer, Mouse Models and Cancer Stem Cells, and Growth Control and Genomic Stability.</p>
<p>The main focus of the Metabolism and Cancer program is to study the intersection between metabolism and cancer, which is fast emerging as an important focus of the Center, and which is seen to have real therapeutic relevance.</p>
<p>The Mouse Models and Cancer Stem Program pursues three avenues of research. The first looks at aspects of stem cell function, including self renewal and differentiation, growth factor requirements and microRNAs with the goal of learning more about tissue and cancer stem cells. The second path of research concerns developmental signaling pathways that are often reactivated and used to drive the cancer cell phenotype. A third theme of this program is the use of mouse models to study cancer biology and the role of inflammation. This part of the program also works on the improvement of lentivirus vectors for cancer therapy and for the development of new cancer models.</p>
<p>The Growth Control and Genomic Stability program&rsquo;s research is based on the increasing recognition that genomic instability and epigenomic changes are a key to cancer progression. Several researchers in this program are pursuing different aspects of the ways that cells respond to DNA damage and maintain genomic integrity.</p>
<p>In addition to research, the Center has an active program of graduate and postdoctoral education and training. The Salk Institute and the Division of Biology at the University of California at San Diego (UCSD) conduct a joint graduate program. In March 2013 the Salk Institute Cancer Center joined the UCSD Moores and the Sanford Burnham NCI-designated cancer centers in forming the San Diego NCI Cancer Centers Council (C3). &nbsp;C3 was created to leverage the distinct resources and talents of the three centers, and to build a new structure and process that would increase interaction and collaboration between cancer center faculties, leading to a deeper understanding of cancer and, ultimately, development of new and better treatments. &nbsp;Thus, the C3 alliance provides unique opportunities in collaborative and translational cancer research afforded by the close proximity of the 3 NCI designated centers.</p>

<p>Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) at the University of Utah is the official cancer center of Utah. HCI's mission is to understand cancer from its beginning, to use that knowledge in the creation and improvement of cancer treatments, to relieve the suffering of cancer patients, and to provide education about cancer risk, prevention, and care.</p>
<p>HCI's roots lie in the Utah Regional Cancer Center, which originally received National Cancer Institute (NCI) Cancer Center designation in 1986. Following a major gift from the Jon M. and Karen Huntsman family, the center was renamed Huntsman Cancer Institute in 1995. In 2015, HCI earned Comprehensive Cancer Center designation from the NCI.</p>
<p>The Cancer Center coalesces the work of more than 200 cancer researchers, and is organized into four research Programs that provide an environment of cancer focus and collaborative exchange: Nuclear Control of Cell Growth and Differentiation, Cell Response and Regulation, Experimental Therapeutics, and Cancer Control and Population Sciences. Ten Disease-Oriented research Teams (DOTs) provide a forum to promote translational research across the Programs. The cancer campus includes nearly one million square-feet of contiguous research and clinical care space. HCI operates a dedicated cancer specialty hospital, two cancer research buildings, a statewide network of Cancer Education Centers, and training programs for cancer researchers and health care professionals. HCI treats patients with all forms of cancer and operates several clinics focusing on patients with a family history of cancer. As the only Comprehensive Cancer Center in the Mountain West, HCI serves the largest geographic region in the country, drawing patients primarily from Utah, Nevada, Idaho, Wyoming, and Montana. HCI also has regional clinics and works with five affiliated hospitals in the region, providing more access to quality cancer care for patients living in rural areas.</p>
<p>The research focus of HCI is cancer genetics. HCI manages the Utah Population Database (UPDB), which is the largest database of its kind in the world with information on more than nine million people linked to genealogies, health records, and vital statistics. This information helps researchers look for genetic patterns of cancer in families, and is used to inform research in precision cancer prevention and personalized cancer treatments. Using the UPDB, HCI researchers have identified numerous cancer-related genes including <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> (breast), <em>APC</em> (colon), <em>p16</em> (melanoma), <em>NF-1</em> (neurofibromatosis), and <em>SDH5</em> (paraganglioma).</p>
<p>At any given time, HCI has 200 clinical trials open, and some trials are available to patients at clinics located in Utah's suburban areas and in neighboring states. HCI is the only facility between Denver and San Francisco offering Phase 1 clinical trials.</p>
<p>Cancer education and outreach are core components of HCI's mission and activities. Our patient and public education services are recognized nationally, reaching more than one million people across the globe, including residents in all 29 Utah counties, all 50 states, and six continents. Utah covers 80,000 square miles, of which 96% is rural or frontier. It is home to seven American Indian tribes or nations. HCI's outreach programs are designed to increase access to cancer education, screening, and care for our underserved populations.</p>

<p>The Fred Hutchinson/University of Washington Cancer Consortium is a research collaboration comprising Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center and its collaborators, the University of Washington, Seattle Children&rsquo;s, and the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance (SCCA). Founded in 1972, Fred Hutch received its NCI comprehensive center designation in 1976, which was expanded to include the entire Consortium in 2003.</p>
<p>By bringing together over 500 faculty with research interests in basic, clinical and public health sciences related to cancer, the Consortium conducts research across many types of cancer to accelerate scientific progress. The faculty in the Consortium are organized into nine research programs: Biostatistics and Computational Biology; Cancer Basic Biology; Cancer Epidemiology, Prevention and Control; Gastrointestinal Cancer; Global Oncology; Hematologic Malignancies; Immunology and Vaccine Development; Prostate Cancer; and Women&rsquo;s Cancer.</p>
<p>There are five scientific areas of special focus in which the Consortium is poised to make an impact: cancer immunotherapy; basic biology of cancer; population-based research; health care economics and outcomes research; and global oncology.<br />One focus of particular significance is Fred Hutch&rsquo;s work on immunotherapy, starting with bone marrow transplantation. Consortium researchers are developing novel approaches to harness immunotherapy to treat leukemia and other cancers. The Consortium is expanding this work into treatment of more common solid tumors such as melanoma, breast, prostate, colon, kidney and ovarian cancer.</p>
<p>The Consortium has an active program of clinical trials, with more than 600 clinical studies active at any one time, investigating the safety and efficacy of new methods of diagnosis, treatment, preventive and supportive care.<br />Research-based outreach by the Consortium to underserved communities takes several forms. In the Asian American community, the Consortium focuses on community development and health education. A collaboration with New Mexico State University focuses on increasing minority engagement in cancer research. Fred Hutch&rsquo;s collaboration with the Seattle Cancer Care Alliance emphasizes activities related to cancer prevention and survivorship.</p>

NCI designation as a comprehensive cancer center came in 1999 and the Center was renamed the UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center in 2007. The Center is a member of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network.</p><p>The Center integrates the work of researchers and clinicians who are dedicated to four fundamental pursuits: laboratory research into the causes and events of cancer&#8217;s progression; clinical research to translate new knowledge into viable treatments; sensitive, state-of-the-art patient care; and population research that can lead to prevention, early detection, and quality-of-life improvement for those living with cancer.</p><p>The Center&#8217;s nearly 400 members and associate members represent dozens of departments and institutes across UCSF, which is the only University of California campus devoted exclusively to the health sciences. Members are faculty investigators in laboratory, clinical, and population-based research who collaborate across the cancer spectrum, from basic biology to risk factors and prevention and control strategies. Among the 11 formal research programs, six are disease-focused (breast, prostate, hematopoietic, neurologic, pancreas, and pediatric), and five address cross-cutting emphases (genetics, cancer and immunity, cell cycling/signaling, society/diversity/disparities, and tobacco control).</p><p>Many other members of the UCSF community&#8212;physicians, nurses, and staff&#8212;contribute to patient care at the Center. Physical facilities, including two dedicated laboratory research buildings, are divided among three UCSF campuses. Eventually, both inpatient and outpatient cancer services will be housed at the University&#8217;s Mission Bay campus, where a new integrated medical center is being built. Clinical areas of special interest at UCSF include breast, prostate, and central nervous system tumors, and neuroblastoma. Patients are offered an opportunity to join clinical trials.</p><p>Other programs of note include a Cancer Risk Program that identifies families and individuals at high risk for colorectal, breast, ovarian, and prostate cancer. Extensive support services include the Ida &amp; Joseph Friend Cancer Resource Center and an award-winning Art for Recovery program, as well as services focusing on cancer survivorship, symptom management, and psycho-oncology.</p><p>Future researchers have many opportunities to pursue studies at UCSF in cancer-focused basic science, prevention and control, and clinical research within M.D., Ph.D., and other graduate programs. There is also a minority training program in cancer control research to increase ethnic diversity in this research field. The Center has a special relationship with Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory to leverage cancer research capabilities, and it also partners with San Francisco State University, a minority-serving institution, to improve the health of minority populations served by the Center.</p><p><em>* This profile was provided by the University of California San Francisco Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center.</em></p></div>]]></body>

<p>Founded in 1971, the University of Southern California Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center (USC Norris) received its NCI designation in 1973. The Center is committed to investigating the complex origins and progression of cancer, developing treatment and prevention strategies, and searching for cures.</p>
<p>USC Norris is located in Los Angeles County, an ethnically diverse and populous region. This population provides an opportunity for the study of cancer patterns, causes, prevention, and treatment. The region&rsquo;s diversity provides the backbone for the Center&rsquo;s efforts in cancer control research and molecular epidemiology.</p>
<p>USC Norris&rsquo; members, including almost 200 scientists and physicians, are drawn from the Keck School of Medicine, College of Letters, Arts and Sciences, and other schools and departments at USC. Together, they are working toward an understanding of the fundamental aspects of cancer. The Center&rsquo;s research takes place in the Renette and Marshall Ezralow Tower, Norman Topping Tower, and the Harlyne J. Norris Cancer Research Tower, where many of the basic scientists work with clinical and population-based researchers.</p>
<p>The Center&rsquo;s research is organized into five thematic and five translational programs. The thematic programs focus on molecular genetics, epigenetics and regulation, tumor microenvironment, cancer epidemiology, and cancer control research. The translational programs concentrate on genitourinary cancers, gastrointestinal cancers, women&rsquo;s cancers, leukemia and lymphoma, and developmental therapeutics. The developmental therapeutics program functions as a bridge, linking together the thematic and translational programs.</p>
<p>The transdisciplinary structure of the research programs allow physicians, epidemiologists, and biologists to work together. For example, when searching for novel treatments for breast cancer, the epidemiologists and geneticists study the environmental and genetic causes of breast cancer while the biochemists investigate the sub-cellular effects of hormonal therapies on breast cancer cells.</p>
<p>In partnership with the Eli and Edythe Broad Center for Regenerative Medicine and Stem Cell Research at the University, USC Norris established the Center for Molecular Pathways and Drug Discoveries, as part of its strategy to integrate stem cell research and cancer therapy.</p>
<p>USC also established the USC Epigenome Center and collaborates with Johns Hopkins University to collect epigenomic data from all major types of cancer. Additionally USC Norris contributes to The Cancer Genome Atlas Project (TCGA) at NCI. Another notable initiative is the Physical Science Oncology Center, which brings together medical, mathematical, and engineering disciplines. Partnerships include the Global Health Institute, the Center for Health Diversities, the Institute for Prevention Research, and the Clinical Translational Science Institute.</p>
<p>Patient care is provided in affiliated hospitals and outpatient clinics, including Children&rsquo;s Hospital Los Angeles, USC Norris Cancer Hospital, USC University Hospital, and the Los Angeles County+USC Medical Center. Many of the patients participate in clinical trials. USC Norris also offers an array of educational opportunities for faculty, staff, students, patients and the community, including continuing education for physicians and other professionals in the community.</p>

<p>The University of Kansas (KU) Cancer Center became an NCI-Designated Cancer Center in 2012. The center&rsquo;s mission, through its innovative approach to drug discovery, delivery, and development, is to transform cancer research and clinical care delivered in Kansas and western Missouri.</p>
<p>KU Cancer Center operates as a matrix organization that includes: the University of Kansas Medical Center campuses in Kansas City, Wichita, and Salina; the University of Kansas in Lawrence and its highly ranked School of Pharmacy (per NIH funding); The University of Kansas Health System; the Stowers Institute for Medical Research; and Children&rsquo;s Mercy Kansas City (via NCI consortium agreements).</p>
<h2>Research at The University of Kansas Cancer Center</h2>
<p>KU Cancer Center places great emphasis on advancing discoveries in the laboratory to the patients&rsquo; bedside. From 2009 to 2017, the center, with industry, academia, government, and philanthropic partners, advanced 19 new cancer therapies into the clinic. Two recent discoveries include Ciclopirox Prodrug for the treatment of bladder cancer, as well as a novel method to treat patients with acute graft-versus-host disease.</p>
<p>The center&rsquo;s researchers also pay special attention to the unique needs of its diverse catchment area, which includes elderly rural individuals, African Americans, American Indians, and Latinos. Moreover, with the Children&rsquo;s Mercy consortium partnership, KU Cancer Center has access to more than 95% of childhood cancer cases in the catchment area. The center&rsquo;s outreach arm, the Midwest Cancer Alliance, connects community hospital clinicians throughout the catchment area to cancer clinical trials available at KU Cancer Center.</p>
<h2>Programs and Initiatives</h2>
<p>KU Cancer Center has four research programs that focus on different aspects of cancer and leverage scientific depth and breadth provided by nationally recognized scientists:</p>
<ol>
<li>Cancer Biology aims to enhance interdisciplinary collaboration among basic and clinical scientists and facilitate translational research involving the etiology, treatment, and prevention of cancer.</li>
<li>Cancer Control &amp; Population Health was developed explicitly to identify better ways to bring cancer control efforts into high-risk and underserved communities. This includes identifying new strategies to improve smoking cessation and advancing the science of translating cancer control into communities and clinical practice, with a particular emphasis on addressing the needs of our catchment area.</li>
<li>Cancer Prevention &amp; Survivorship centers on the discovery of processes and biomarker changes important early in cancer development and use of these biomarkers as response indicators in early-phase translational trials of new prevention interventions. Research on natural compounds is one area of emphasis.</li>
<li>Drug Discovery, Delivery &amp; Experimental Therapeutics aims to discover novel anticancer drugs active against novel drug targets and find new indications for currently marketed drugs.

<p>The precursor of the current Markey Cancer Center (MCC) began in 1975 with the formation of the McDowell Cancer Network, a community outreach and education program. Today the MCC is a critical component of the University of Kentucky and a vital resource for the Commonwealth of Kentucky and the central Appalachian region. Situated in the heart of the state and on a campus with all six health professions colleges in close proximity to one another, the MCC is at the center of a vibrant and expanding research community. The MCC became an NCI-designated Cancer Center in 2013.</p>
<p>The MCC&rsquo;s mission is to reduce cancer mortality through a comprehensive program of cancer research, treatment, education, and community engagement with a particular focus on the underserved Appalachian population of eastern Kentucky. In fact, the MCC is the only NCI-designated cancer center focused on the health of the central Appalachian population of which represents one of the most economically-disadvantaged, disease-burdened and medically-underserved regions in the U.S.</p>
<p>The MCC&rsquo;s 130 members hold appointments in 26 departments in eight colleges across the university and are organized into four thematic research programs: Cancer Cell Biology and Signaling; Cancer Prevention and Control; Drug Discovery, Delivery and Translational Therapeutics; and Redox Injury and Repair. To support and complement their research, MCC members have access to established shared resource facilities including Biospecimen and Tissue Procurement; Biostatistics and Bioinformatics; Cancer Research Informatics; Flow Cytometry and Cell Sorting; and Free Radical Biology and Metabolism.</p>
<p>Clinically, as the state with the highest all-site cancer incidence rate and the highest rate of cancer deaths in the United States, Kentucky suffers from particularly intractable cancer health challenges. As such, the MCC proudly serves all of central and eastern Kentucky, western West Virginia, northeastern Tennessee, southeastern Indiana and southern Ohio, for a total catchment population of nearly eight million people. The MCC catchment area continues to expand as a result of increased activity with ten central and eastern Kentucky-based affiliate hospitals, one in western Kentucky, one in southern Ohio and a strong collaboration with Norton Healthcare in Louisville.</p>
<p>The MCC is dedicated to training the next generation of cancer researchers, clinicians, and other health care providers. Current research training programs are focused generally on cancer biology for PhDs and clinician-scientists; the roles that the environment, oxidative stress, and nutrition have on the molecular mechanisms that contribute to cancer; developing novel nanotechnology-based approaches for detecting and treating cancer; and training physicians in the area of cancer prevention and control.</p>

<p>In the late 1960s, a group of scientists and volunteers at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) came together to develop a cancer center they hoped would become renowned for excellence in research, education and patient care. In 1976, the group was awarded NCI designation and became UCLA&rsquo;s Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center (JCCC). Today, more than 250 physicians and scientists are working for the JCCC to deliver the highest standards of excellence in patient care, education, basic science, clinical research and cancer prevention.</p>
<p>The JCCC&rsquo;s long standing vision is to be an international leader conducting transdisciplinary cancer research that advances the most effective approaches to prevention, detection and treatment while delivering the highest quality patient-centered, integrated care.</p>
<p>Each year, JCCC physicians have over 20,000 patient visits and conduct hundreds of clinical trials. This robust clinical enterprise allows our scientists to take cancer treatment from bench to beside and benefit not only from interaction with their colleagues in the lab, but also the physicians who are putting their ideas into real-world practice. The JCCC facilitates an extensive range of clinical trials at UCLA, its affiliated sites throughout southern California, through Translational Research in Oncology US (TRIO-US) and worldwide through TRIO-Global. These strategic partnerships allow patients worldwide access to leading-edge treatment and clinical trials.</p>
<p>The JCCC is world-renowned as a leader in clinical trials testing of molecularly targeted therapies, and the Center&rsquo;s quest to find new and more effective therapies cancer has resulted in notable number of groundbreaking discoveries. These include Herceptin for breast cancer, developed based on pre-clinical and clinical researched conducted at UCLA, and Keytruda, the recently FDA-approved breakthrough immunotherapy treatment for metastatic melanoma. JCCC researchers were also integral partners in the development of leading-edge treatments Avastin, Palbociclib and Gleevec.</p>
<p>The JCCC has a long tradition of outreach to its Los Angeles community and is a proven leader in health disparities research. This commitment is highlighted by the Center&rsquo;s extensive contribution to the battle against breast and colorectal cancer among underserved populations. This community-based work also coincides with the JCCC&rsquo;s many preventive initiatives, and these efforts focus on reducing the incidence of cancer through everything from leading-edge gene therapies to simple lifestyle modifications.</p>
<p>The JCCC is further committed to providing supportive cancer care to patients that extends far beyond diagnosis, to treat the whole person and not just the disease. The Center offers numerous programs that connect patients with physicians, counselors and alternative medicine practitioners to complement the important aspects of cancer care that occur outside our clinics and hospitals. The JCCC is also a leader in developing cancer survivorship programs that seek to address the emotional and spiritual needs of these patients that are often neglected in modern cancer treatment.</p>
<p>Training the next generation of physicians and scientists is a core mission of the JCCC. The Center works closely with both the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA and basic science faculty to ensure that promising young investigators are identified early in their career. The JCCC relies on a constant influx of fresh ideas and perspectives to fuel the innovation that is a hallmark of the Center.</p>
