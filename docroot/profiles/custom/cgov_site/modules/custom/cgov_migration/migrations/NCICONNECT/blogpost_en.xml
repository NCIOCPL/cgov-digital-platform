<p>The inaugural <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=7&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=943&amp;sys_contentid=1120587" sys_dependentvariantid="943" sys_dependentid="1120587" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7363342" sys_variantid="943" sys_contentid="1120587">NCI-CONNECT (Comprehensive Oncology Network Evaluating Rare CNS Tumors)</a> Meeting was held in conjunction with the <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/neuro-oncology-branch/bttc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative (BTTC) </a>Annual Meeting at the NIH. The meetings on June 11-12, 2018, were hosted by the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), NCI, and was the largest BTTC meeting to date with over 100 attendees.</p>
<p>The goal of the meetings were to bring together leaders in neuro-oncology clinical care, basic science and clinical research with advocacy partners in a collegial and collaborative environment to discuss current and future brain tumor clinical trials. Attendees shared new clinical trial concepts that had both high levels of scientific merit and also incorporated measures of patient quality of life and outcomes. The aim is to help advance treatments for patients with malignant brain tumors, with a particular focus on rare tumors of the central nervous system.</p>
<p>An overview of each session and a summary of key findings from the meeting is provided below.</p>
<h2>Day 1: Monday, June 11</h2>
<p>The first day focused on NCI-CONNECT, a new program supported by the Cancer Moonshot℠. This new program will use the existing and successful BTTC infrastructure and network for clinical trials. NCI-CONNECT aims to advance the understanding of rare adult central nervous system (CNS) cancers by establishing and fostering patient-advocacy-provider partnerships and networks to improve approaches to care and treatment.</p>
<p>Mark Gilbert, M.D., the principal investigator for the BTTC, co-director of NCI-CONNECT and chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the NIH, welcomed attendees. He shared an overview of the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=19&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7363343" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">current open clinical trials</a> for patients with rare CNS cancers at the NIH and ways the BTTC network can <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121717" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121717" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7363344" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121717">refer patients</a>. One of these studies, the Natural History Study, led by Terri Armstrong, Ph.D., ANP-BC, co-director of NCI-CONNECT and deputy chief in the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the NIH, evaluates the natural history and collects specimens for patients with CNS cancers to better understand the disease and uncover areas for further research. Patients receive free care at the NIH if they&rsquo;re enrolled on a study, allowing patients and their families to focus on treatment instead of costs.</p>
<p>Dr. Armstrong shared plans to maximize data collection. Studies will collect DNA specimens from patients and caregivers. This will help improve the understanding of <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121711" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121711" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7363345" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121711">outcomes and risk factors</a> associated with the occurrence of rare CNS tumors. Patients don&rsquo;t need to visit the NIH to take part in in the study. Instead, they can participate at home by completing an online survey and submitting a saliva sample to be used for <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046128&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046128&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">genetic testing</a>.</p>
<p>Jill Barnholtz-Sloan, Ph.D., professor at Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, and Carol Kruchko, president and chief mission officer of the <a href="http://www.cbtrus.org/reports/reports.html">Central Brain Tumor Registry of the United States (CBTRUS)</a>, discussed how CBTRUS gathers and shares surveillance and <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000257225&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000257225&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">epidemiology</a> data and is the sole source in the United States for incidences for all primary CNS tumors. Knowing this data helps investigators design clinical, research, epidemiologic and survivorship trials and studies. They are currently working on a report with data on NCI-CONNECT&rsquo;s selected <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2317&amp;sys_contentid=1120626" sys_dependentvariantid="2317" sys_dependentid="1120626" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7363346" sys_variantid="2317" sys_contentid="1120626">12 rare CNS tumors</a>. In the future, they plan to collect data based on the 2016 WHO classification and surveillance of <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045618&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045618&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">biomarkers</a>.</p>
<p>The morning continued with disease-focused discussions led by BTTC investigators to review current treatments and associated challenges, and then discuss treatment advances for the following tumor types in adults:</p>
<ul>
<li>High Grade Meningioma by Priscilla Brastianos, M.D., Massachusetts General Hospital
<ul>
<li>Current treatment and challenges: This session discussed the recent findings about the genomic alterations in meningioma genomes; they are simple and show clinically significant <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046063&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046063&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">mutations</a>. Investigators should consider if molecular classification could revolutionize treatment for meningiomas like it has in other CNS tumors and molecular biomarkers should be incorporated to diagnose and plan treatment.</li>
<li>Future trials should investigate targeted therapies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Midline Glioma by Brett Theeler, M.D., Walter Reed National Military Medical Center
<ul>
<li>Current treatment and challenges: Diffuse midline glioma H3K27M-mutant was a new subtype reported in 2016 by the World Health Organization. H3F3A is the most common histone mutations in adults and pediatric patients. There are four other mutations: TP53, ATRX, PPM1D, and ACVR1. Standard treatment includes: biopsy, adjuvant radiotherapy (depending on location) and low evidence of <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045387&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045387&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">temozolomide</a>&rsquo;s effectiveness. Patients have poor outcomes regardless of H3 mutation status.</li>
<li>Future trials should investigate the drug ONC201 dopamine D2 <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044958&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000044958&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">receptor</a> <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000350250&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000350250&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">antagonist</a> as an <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045729&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045729&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">immunotherapy</a> for these tumors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) by Dr. Theeler
<ul>
<li>Current treatment and challenges: The first generation of BRAF inhibitors were used in PXAs. The BRAF inhibitor PLX8394 was studied in a phase I/II clinical trial for patients with rare CNS neoplasms and preliminary results were presented at American Society of Clinical Oncology 2018 meeting.</li>
<li>Future trials using BRAF inhibitors would need to be more inclusive in enrolling patients and investigators need to learn more about non-BRAF PXAs.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Medulloblastoma by Marta Penas-Prado, M.D., The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center
<ul>
<li>Current treatment and challenges: Adult data is far behind the pediatric data for medulloblastoma and there are few prospective trials. The optimal chemotherapy has shown to improve outcomes, but also cause many toxicities. Subgroups do not indicate survival.</li>
<li>Future trial designs would benefit from using optimal chemotherapy, radiation therapy, liquid biopsies, immune profiling and advanced images.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Atypical Teratoid Rhabdoid Tumor (AT/RT) by Nicole Shonka, M.D., University of Nebraska Medical Center
<ul>
<li>Current treatment and challenges: AT/RT shows loss of function mutation in the INI1/SMARCB1 gene. There are three pediatric subgroups: ATRT-TYR, ATRT-SHH and ATRT-MYC and three molecular and epigenetic subgroups, but there is no subtype for adults. A <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045576&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045576&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">tamoxifen</a> injection inactivates the SMARCB1 gene in mouse models.</li>
<li>Future trials should use therapies designed for subgroups using specific pathways.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Preclinical Models by Eric Holland, M.D., Ph.D., University of Washington
<ul>
<li>Current treatment and challenges: For supratentorial ependymoma, researchers are using the RCAS/tv-a system to determine if the C11 orf95 RELA fusion is enough. Results are challenging since only half of the mouse models develop a tumor. For comparisons of glioma in multiple species, they&rsquo;re generating various animal models to find a unifying theory of gliomas among mammals. Modeling IDH-mutant gliomas can be challenging because they have different immune status. <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046507&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046507&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">Bilateral</a> gliomas as an experimental paradigm model can be generated with different genetics to help researchers study local and systemic therapies and their interactions. The immune competent RCAS/tva mouse models for brain tumors are ependymoma, medulloblastoma, <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000383924&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000383924&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">PNET</a>, <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000584380&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000584380&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">AT/RT</a>, <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000794156&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000794156&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">DIPG</a>, CNS sarcomas, ISH mutant gliomas and PXA. More molecular data on human disease is needed to be sure how similar mouse models are.</li>
<li>Future trials should be a multi-arm concept and non-competing, as enrollment would be low with the rare population.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the key features of these disease-specific talks was that they led to focused discussions about these tumors including the implementation of molecular classifications and biomarkers to advance treatments and how to develop targeted therapy clinical trials. This was particularly important in tumor types where genetic mutations and subgroups have been identified. Investigators also discussed the need for collaboration and awareness to move trial designs forward.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brittany Cordeiro, advocacy liaison and navigator of NCI-CONNECT, led the advocacy breakout sessions, with NCI-CONNECT colleagues, Drs. Armstrong and Gilbert, and Kristin Odom, communications editor. The NCI-CONNECT advocacy partners are non-profit organizations that have agreed to facilitate engagement with patients with selected rare CNS tumors by sharing information about available clinical trials and information generated by NCI-CONNECT to educate patients. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=7&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7363347" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121675">Advocate representatives</a> from five non-profit organizations &ndash; the American Brain Tumor Association, Biden Cancer Initiative, CERN Foundation, International Brain Tumour Alliance and National Brain Tumor Society &ndash; attended the meeting. These sessions included focused discussions on patient education and communications, clinical trial accrual, advocacy training and resources, and clinical care and treatment at the NIH.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, Dr. Armstrong shared information about the NIH tumor repository. Plans are underway to collect tumor samples with clinical history from patients with selected CNS tumors. The repository will allow researchers to more accurately classify CNS tumor types and predict outcomes. Data collected from the tumor repository will help scientists to predict which drugs, and combination of drugs, will have a therapeutic effect.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, Christine Siegel, nurse practitioner, and Kiera Caffee and Tracy Ani, patient care coordinators, in the Neuro-Oncology Branch at the NIH, shared how patients can <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch?qt-nob_quicktabs=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">be referred</a> for neuro-oncology clinical care at the NIH. The Neuro-Oncology Branch clinical care team works together with patients&rsquo; primary care physicians to ensure they receive the best treatment possible. Patients or physicians can contact <a href="mailto:NCINOBReferrals@mail.nih.gov?subject=NOB%20Referral">NCINOBReferrals@mail.nih.gov</a> or call 1-866-251-9686&nbsp;or&nbsp;240-760-6010.</p>
<p>The first day of the meeting concluded with a discussion on multi-arm trial planning, led by Drs. Gilbert and Armstrong, and Tito Mendoza, Ph.D., and Ying Yuan, Ph.D., of MD Anderson Cancer Center. The meeting brought NCI-CONNECT advocacy partners together with neuro-oncology researchers and clinicians for the first time. The goal of this discussion was to allow investigators to hear the perspective of people who help patients find and participate in clinical trials and educate patients on treatment and care decisions. The NCI-CONNECT advocacy partners were a valuable addition to the conversation.</p>
<p>The day ended with an evening reception celebrating the 15 year anniversary of the BTTC and the Head for the Cure Foundation.</p>
<h2>Day 2: Tuesday, June 12</h2>
<p>Dr. Gilbert welcomed attendees to the BTTC meeting. The BTTC was created in 2003 as a network of medical centers with the expertise and the desire to participate in state-of-the-art clinical trials investigating new treatments for malignant brain tumors.</p>
<p>Caryn Steakley, deputy clinical director of the CCR, shared her support of the BTTC as a stellar program in the NCI Intramural Research Program. The CCR at NCI serves as the lead institution and coordinating center for the BTTC.</p>
<p>Michael Pollack, Ph.D., supervisory technology transfer specialist at NCI, oversees the BTTC site agreements. Drs. Gilbert and Pollack discussed the status of current and legacy trials and agreements. Trial information is available online at<a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/neuro-oncology-branch/bttc/clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> ccr.canger.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch</a>.</p>
<p>The morning sessions for investigators continued with the following protocol concept ideas proposed to the group by BTTC investigators:</p>
<ul>
<li>&nbsp;Phase II Study of Trametinib and Trametinib plus Pembrolizumab in Recurrent Glioblastoma with Alterations in NF1
<ul>
<li>Howard Colman, M.D., Huntsman Cancer Institute</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enhanced Nanoliposomal Targeting of Glioblastoma by Combining BXQ350 and Bevacizumab
<ul>
<li>Vinay Puduvalli, M.D., Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Regorafenib in Glioblastoma: A Biomarker-driven Adaptive Design Clinical Trial
<ul>
<li>David Cachia, M.D., Medical University of South Carolina&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Combination of PD-1 Inhibitor and IDO Inhibitor at First Progression in Surgically Accessible Recurrent Glioblastoma
<ul>
<li>Jacob Mandel, M.D., Baylor College of Medicine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Randomized Phase II Study of Temozolomide +Eflornithine (DFMO) Versus Temozolomide Alone After Radiation and Temozolomide for Newly Diagnosed Patients with Anaplastic Gliomas with IDH Mutation
<ul>
<li>Howard Colman, M.D., Huntsman Cancer Institute</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/neuro-oncology-branch/bttc/doctors-institutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">32 BTTC investigators</a> in attendance thoroughly discussed the trial concepts and showed enthusiasm for moving forward. The plan is to continue discussions on these proposals with the expectation that several will be fully developed into BTTC clinical trials.&nbsp; More information will be shared as those trial concepts progress.</p>
<p>Kenneth Aldape, M.D., chief of the Laboratory of Pathology, and Eytan Ruppin, M.D., Ph.D., chief of Data Science, both of CCR, NCI, at the NIH, discussed the concept of applying synthetic lethality, a concept where molecular testing of cancers reveal potential therapeutic targets that are unique because the likely partner that would lead to treatment resistance has been lost. Dr. Aldape explained that histology, or studying tumor tissue under a microscope, has its limits in classifying CNS tumors. And when there is difficulty in histology diagnosis, it&rsquo;s useful to genetically profile brain tumors. More, <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000655031&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000655031&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">methylation</a> patterns help define the cells of origin for CNS tumors, so DNA methylation profiling can also be used to classify brain tumors and help sort out biological differences. Dr. Ruppin further explained they&rsquo;re looking for actionable genetic mutations &ndash; events that transform normal cells to cancer cells &ndash; to target vulnerabilities particularly when loss of partner genes make the vulnerabilities even more likely to cause death of the cancer cells. The goal is to allow doctors to more accurately develop personalized therapies for patients.</p>
<p>Breakout sessions for research staff to learn more about the programmatic and clinical care details of BTTC clinical trials were led by the BTTC Coordinating Center team members at the NCI/NIH. The coordinating center team shared how they can prepare for the GBM Pembro HSPPC trial opening at the additional BTTC sites. Nurse Practitioner Christine Siegel discussed the care of patients on immunotherapy drugs, like pembrolizumab, BTTC Protocol Coordinator Jennifer Reyes shared an overview of the regulatory requirements for BTTC members to initiate the trial at their sites, Research Nurse Sonja Crandon gave an overview of an electronic survey given to study participants to assess how well they are doing, and BTTC Project Manager Katie Blackburn provided a demonstration of the tissue and blood collection kits for clinical trials.</p>
<p>The breakout sessions for research staff also included future clinical trial concepts. Nurse Practitioner Lisa Boris and Research Nurse Chrissy Bryla shared information on a proposed phase II trial using a drug called TG02, which has been shown to kill glioma cancer cells. The safety of the drug in combination with another chemotherapy drug is currently being evaluated in a <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/clinical-trials" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">phase I trial</a> enrolling patients with recurrent anaplastic <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045602&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045602&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">astrocytoma</a> and glioblastoma at the NIH. NCI Research Analyst Elizabeth Vera, who focuses on patient outcomes, presented an overview of a proposed tissue repository study that would collect both tissue and clinical data from patients with rare CNS tumors.&nbsp;The goal of the tissue repository study is to better understand the tumors and to develop clinical trials to target the tumors and improve patient care.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the NCI-CONNECT and BTTC Meetings were a great success. Attendees learned from other neuro-oncology experts and advocates, participated in invigorating discussions on current disease treatments and advances in the pipeline, and reviewed proposed clinical trials and thoroughly discussed new ideas and concepts for multi-arm clinical trials, all with the ultimate goal of improving therapies and outcomes for adult patients with brain and spine tumors.&nbsp;</p>

<p>To advance the understanding of rare adult central nervous system (CNS) cancers, a program at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is connecting healthcare providers with each other and information resources.</p>
<p>Co-leading the program, called <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=1774&amp;sys_contentid=1120587" sys_contentid="1120587" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="1774" sys_relationshipid="7290739" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1120587" sys_dependentvariantid="1774">NCI-CONNECT,</a> is <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/mark-r-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gilbert, M.D.</a>, chief of the <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuro-Oncology Branch</a> at the Center for Cancer Research (CCR), NCI, at the NIH.</p>
<p>Early in his career, Dr. Gilbert recognized there was an area of unmet need for patients with brain tumors. He received his medical doctorate from Johns Hopkins University in 1982 and completed residencies in internal medicine, neurology, and neuro-oncology. &ldquo;I learned most of oncology excludes patients with brain tumors, so it was an area that I wanted to focus on,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<p>Over the past 32 years as a neuro-oncologist, Dr. Gilbert has garnered many accolades and led extraordinary initiatives to improve treatments and outcomes for patients with malignant brain and spine cancers, but most importantly, he has learned that every patient is unique.</p>

</div>
<p>Treating brain and spine cancer patients has also impacted Dr. Gilbert personally. &ldquo;I have gained a unique perspective about the uncertainty of life and the importance of certain things and unimportance of other things that we often place tremendous amount of value on,&rdquo; shares Dr. Gilbert. &nbsp;He believes that material objects are meaningless when facing a critical and potentially terminal illness. &ldquo;When I am helping patients navigate their illness, the trivial things seem really trivial,&rdquo; he says.</p>
<h2>Treating Rare CNS Cancers</h2>
<p>All primary brain and spine cancers are considered rare cancers. Many have less than 2,000 people diagnosed a year. The low incidence rates of these cancers mean providers and researchers face unique challenges treating patients and discovering new therapies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s difficult to complete studies to better understand CNS cancers because there are few patients for clinical trials and few tumor samples to study,&rdquo; says Dr. Gilbert. &ldquo;And without enough knowledge of the disease, it&rsquo;s hard to establish standards of care and provide definite answers to important questions that patients and families pose.&rdquo; Patients are forced to navigate a hardly understood disease.</p>
<p>To help eliminate some of the burdens patients and families face, the NIH provides <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch?qt-nob_quicktabs=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">consultations free-of-charge</a>. After a patient is accepted on a study, treatments, tests, and other services at the NIH are free. This eliminates a huge financial burden for the&nbsp;patient and allows physicians to focus on their specific disease,&nbsp;optimizing treatment without the consideration of third-party approval or concerns about financial ramifications of recommending therapy.</p>
<p>Further, NIH providers believe in collaborating with a patient&rsquo;s <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=12&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121717" sys_contentid="1121717" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="2297" sys_relationshipid="7290733" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1121717" sys_dependentvariantid="2297">treating physician</a>. &ldquo;Treatments at the NIH are study-based, so therapies are provided- and we co-manage the patients with their local physicians.&nbsp;When patients need standard of care therapies, we often collaborate with their physician or healthcare team who prescribe and provide these treatments,&rdquo; says Dr. Gilbert.</p>
<p>Patients and physicians can contact the Neuro-Oncology Branch at <a href="mailto:NCINOBReferrals@mail.nih.gov?subject=NOB%20Referral" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCINOBReferrals@mail.nih.gov</a> or 1-866-251-9686 for referrals or to make an appointment.</p>
<h2>The Genesis of NCI-CONNECT</h2>
<p>Dr. Gilbert, along with&nbsp;<a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/terri-s-armstrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri Armstrong, Ph.D.</a>, deputy chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch, recognized they had an unprecedented opportunity to focus research efforts on rare CNS cancers with funding from the <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/research/cancer-moonshot" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Cancer Moonshot℠</a>.</p>
<p>Thus, Drs. Gilbert and Armstrong developed NCI-CONNECT (Comprehensive Oncology Evaluating Rare CNS Tumors) to establish paradigms to study <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2317&amp;sys_contentid=1120626" sys_contentid="1120626" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="2317" sys_relationshipid="7290734" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1120626" sys_dependentvariantid="2317">12 rare adult CNS cancers</a>. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hopefully, if successful, we can apply our approach to all CNS cancers and rare cancers in general,&rdquo; says Dr. Gilbert.</p>
<p>NCI-CONNECT is multidisciplinary. &ldquo;Our approach is to connect basic science research to patient outcomes research and scientifically-based <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_contentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="2297" sys_relationshipid="7290735" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297">clinical trials</a> with the aim of establishing better therapies and standard of care. This model could have a huge impact,&rdquo; says Dr. Gilbert.</p>
<p>To overcome the challenge of reaching patients, NCI-CONNECT will partner with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121675" sys_contentid="1121675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="2297" sys_relationshipid="7290736" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1121675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297">non-profit organizations</a> and use <a href="https://twitter.com/NIHBrainTumor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a> and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2054&amp;sys_contentid=1121159" sys_contentid="1121159" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="2054" sys_relationshipid="7290737" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1121159" sys_dependentvariantid="2054">web-based educational tools</a>.</p>
<p>NCI-CONNECT also plans to develop web-based educational content for physicians, nurses and researchers. &ldquo;Healthcare providers need resources and a place to refer patients with rare CNS tumors, knowing that we will collaborate closely with them,&rdquo; says Dr. Gilbert. Community-based providers also have the opportunity be part of a <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/neuro-oncology-branch/bttc/doctors-institutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">larger network</a> of investigators, called the Brain Tumor Trials Collaborative (BTTC),&nbsp;who collaborate to advance treatments for patients with brain and spine tumors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We value our relationships with community-based providers and non-profit organizations because they can help identify patients who would benefit from our program activities,&rdquo; says Dr. Gilbert. &ldquo;Ultimately, broadening our reach will help accrue patients for clinical trials so we can improve approaches to care and treatment for patients with rare CNS cancers.&rdquo;</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>In January 2004, I was catapulted from being a wife, mother and journalist to a role that I never dreamed I would play &ndash; that of a caregiver to a brain tumor patient.</p>
<p>My husband and I were sitting in a tiny, windowless room in a London hospital when news was given to us that our 24-year-old son, Colin, had a grade 2 <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045602&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045602&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">astrocytoma</a> in his <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120672" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7118944" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120672">left temporal lobe</a>. But we may as well have been sitting on a planet in outer space. We immediately felt like travelers on a strange and surreal planet. We didn&rsquo;t speak the language of medicine. We didn&rsquo;t know how to get from A to B. We were filled with fear and dread of the unknown journey ahead.</p>
<h2>One of the Cruelest of Cancers</h2>
<p>There are more than 130 different types of primary brain tumors and all are considered rare diseases. Brain tumors are no respecter of race, religion, sex, age or geography. They strike all people around the world with the same ferocity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Brain tumors affect mobility, <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000476290&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000476290&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">cognition</a>, personality and behavior &ndash; all the things that make us individuals. Patients often experience <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045484&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045484&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">seizures</a>, which have a devastating effect on <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045417&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045417&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">quality of life</a>.</p>
<p>There is inequity in accessing promising new therapies. There are misdiagnoses and late diagnoses. There is a lack of sufficient funding for brain tumor research. There aren&rsquo;t enough clinical trials. Apart from exposure to <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000430698&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000430698&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">ionizing radiation</a> and a handful of rare, inherited syndromes, the causes of brain tumors are largely unknown, so there are no prevention strategies.</p>
<p>Brain tumors kill more children and young adults under age 40 than any other cancer. A brain tumor diagnosis can have substantial economic impact on a family as well. Many patients can&rsquo;t return to work and their partners have to leave their jobs to be a caregiver.</p>
<p>All these things contribute to the nightmare of a brain tumor diagnosis.</p>
<h2>Our Brain Tumor Story</h2>
<p>As for our own family&rsquo;s experience, Colin&rsquo;s symptoms presented mostly as headaches and double vision, which prompted him to visit his primary care doctor. Because he was an otherwise fit and healthy young man and keen mountain biker, the general practitioner suspected it was &ldquo;just&rdquo; migraines and duly prescribed tablets, reassuring him, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry. It&rsquo;s not like you have a brain tumor or anything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Despite the medication, Colin&rsquo;s symptoms worsened. The double vision and debilitating headaches persisted.</p>
<p>Colin then visited an optician. Within a short time of examining Colin, she feared something sinister was causing the swelling behind his eyes and arranged an appointment with an eye specialist. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The next day Colin was examined by a consultant ophthalmologist who ordered an MRI, which was done within 24 hours. The night of the MRI we received a call from the hospital to say that an ambulance was on its way to pick Colin up because the neurosurgeon was waiting to see him as a critical case.</p>
<p>Thus, we found ourselves in that tiny, windowless room in a London hospital, shocked to the core at the diagnosis and hurtled into the most challenging journey of our lives. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Colin&rsquo;s tumor eventually progressed to a <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045698&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045698&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">glioblastoma</a>, the most aggressive and lethal form of brain cancer. He died in 2011 at age 32. During his seven-and-a-half-year journey, he had three neurosurgeries (including an awake <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046457&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046457&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">craniotomy</a>), six weeks of radiotherapy with oral chemotherapy, followed by 18 additional months of oral chemotherapy, plus treatment with an anti-angiogenic and finally, an experimental therapy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Colin wrote of his experience, &ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s very important for the doctors, nurses and support staff to explain things to patients and their families in a confident, clear and concise manner. It&rsquo;s also important for patients to be able to talk to the medical staff without any boundaries.&rdquo; His explanation as to why nurses wore white? &ldquo;They&rsquo;re all angels.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Despite his brain tumor, Colin enjoyed and appreciated life. He had a full-time job with a mechanical and electrical engineering company and loved riding his mountain bike. His pride and joy was his white Italian sportscar, although for long periods of his brain tumor journey he lost his driving license because of his seizures.</p>
<p>But acknowledging that even the darkest, most threatening and seemingly all-encompassing cloud could have a silver lining, Colin wrote, &ldquo;I now appreciate the finer things in life even more, like the fairer sex, good literature, jazz&hellip; and simply breathing.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Sustaining Hope Through an International Alliance</h2>
<p>Over the course of our family&rsquo;s brain tumor journey, one of the first things we realized was the crucial importance of maintaining hope despite the substantial and numerous challenges of this devastating disease. Knowing that there are determined and dedicated researchers around the world investigating new therapies has always given me hope.&nbsp;</p>
<p>My desire to give hope and support to families on the brain tumor journey helped lead - with a group of other determined patient advocates - to the creation of the <a href="https://theibta.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">International Brain Tumour Alliance (IBTA)</a>, a unique global network founded in 2005 as a dynamic worldwide community for brain tumor patient organizations and others involved in the field of neuro- oncology. <br />&nbsp;<br />The IBTA brings together experience and expertise from all over the world with the aim of enhancing the well-being and quality of life of brain tumor patients and their families. &nbsp;We have alliance supporters in 111 countries. Across the globe, we work on a wide range of high level projects to benefit the brain tumor community while at the same time disseminating knowledge, information and best practice to help shape health and research policies at national and international levels.</p>
<h2>Proud to Be Partnering with NCI-CONNECT</h2>
<p>To further engage with brain tumor patients, the IBTA is very proud to be associated with NCI-CONNECT.&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7118945" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121675">Partnership </a>initiatives like NCI-CONNECT bring us additional hope that there will be improvements in treatments and care for brain and central nervous system tumor patients.</p>
<p>In the brain tumor world, innovative approaches to research, care and support must be implemented. Progress should be made at a faster pace because people with brain tumors and their families don&rsquo;t have the luxury of time.</p>
<p>International collaboration is absolutely key to achieving much better outcomes in this disease. We can all play a part here. As patient advocates, healthcare professionals, researchers and those involved in all other aspects of neuro-oncology, every morning we should ask ourselves, &ldquo;What can I do for brain tumor patients today?&rdquo; And every evening we should ask, &ldquo;Have I done enough?&rdquo;</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>In 1989, at 14 years old, I injured my tailbone. Thereafter, I had severe pain in this area. I managed the pain for over 18 months, all the while searching for solutions with various health practitioners.</p>
<p>Eventually, I found an orthopedic surgeon who initiated immediate hospitalization. The problem was diagnosed as a grade I myxopapillary <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120675" sys_contentid="1120675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="2297" sys_relationshipid="7263092" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1120675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297">ependymoma</a> inside my lower spinal canal.</p>
<p>I turned 16 years old in the hospital awaiting neurosurgery. MRI technology was not yet available in New Zealand, so while my family and I hoped the neurosurgeon had successfully removed all the tumor, we had no way of knowing for sure. I then had 50Gy of radiation treatment and two abdominal surgeries &ndash; one before and one after radiation &ndash; to protect my ovaries.</p>
<p>I learned to walk again, earned a Bachelor of Health Science in Nursing, and enjoyed a reasonably normal early adulthood &ndash; working, traveling, running, dancing, and making the most of every moment.</p>
<h2>Recurrence Over 10 Years Later</h2>
<p>In my late twenties, the pain in my back and legs increased. The tumor was growing and affecting many areas of my life. At that time, I was a nurse and needed to be able to lift patients, however this became too difficult to do, so I adjusted my career and studied and worked in other areas of health and sports medicine that were less physically demanding. I also had <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000454763&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000454763&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">muscle wasting</a> in my left leg causing footdrop and falls.</p>
<p>In 2006, I had my first de-bulking neurosurgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Further de-bulking surgeries in 2012 and 2014 were followed by my second &ldquo;lifetime dose&rdquo; of radiation. While these interventions removed some of the tumor and possibly slowed its growth, they also resulted in further disability, <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000390268&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000390268&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">dysfunction</a>, and pain. I took maximum doses of pain medication for many years to help with episodes of debilitating spasms and chronic neuropathic pain. In 2015, I contracted bacterial spinal <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000471780&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000471780&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">meningitis</a> and was hospitalized for five months, during which time I had four more neurosurgeries.</p>
<p>In April 2017, at age 44, I received a letter from my multidisciplinary <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120671" sys_contentid="1120671" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="2297" sys_relationshipid="7263089" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1120671" sys_dependentvariantid="2297">healthcare team</a> of neurosurgeons and radiation oncologists stating, &ldquo;The team does not feel there are any further treatment options for this patient in New Zealand.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>A New Reason to Hope</h2>
<p>Since my teenage years, I have enjoyed reading about medical breakthroughs, particularly <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045729&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045729&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">immunotherapy</a>. For years, I followed the research of <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/mark-r-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gilbert, M.D.</a>, now chief of the <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuro-Oncology Branch</a> at the Center for Cancer Research, NCI, at the NIH. I was hopeful that an immunotherapy trial might be imminent, so I contacted NIH&rsquo;s <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch?qt-nob_quicktabs=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">neuro-oncology team</a>.</p>
<p>In June 2017, with the support and encouragement of my family,&nbsp;I traveled with my fianc&eacute; to the NIH in Bethesda, Maryland, for an assessment. There, I met Dr. Gilbert and the neuro-oncology clinical care team. I was accepted into their immunotherapy trial investigating the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_contentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="2297" sys_relationshipid="7263090" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297">drug nivolumab</a> for patients with select rare central nervous system (CNS) cancers, including ependymoma. We were hopeful that after 18 months on <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000767747&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000767747&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">nivolumab</a>, I would be cured.&nbsp;I lived in Washington D.C. during the trial.&nbsp;My&nbsp;fianc&eacute; returned&nbsp;home&nbsp;to New Zealand&nbsp;for work, and&nbsp;visited me&nbsp;approximately every 6 weeks.</p>
<p>In February 2018, six months into the trial, my <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000443329&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000443329&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">sacrum</a> cracked through S1-S2 vertebrae, causing my spine to collapse. This was due to the destructive nature of the tumor that had eroded the sacrum and surrounding spinal bones. I was temporarily paralyzed. After two weeks of bed rest, I had a 13-hour neurosurgery to stabilize my spine and in the process, the surgeon removed approximately 25 percent of the tumor.</p>
<p>After surgery, analysis of my tumor tissue showed the immunotherapy drug nivolumab had not appeared to change the amount of <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000044928&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044928&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">T cell</a> activity as compared with my pre-trial biopsy tumor tissue. Consequently, I was taken off the clinical trial and Dr. Gilbert recommended chemotherapy (<a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000390335&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000390335&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">lapatinib</a> and <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000507640&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000507640&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">temodar</a>). I have since had three MRI scans and while the tumor has not shrunk, it has not grown either. This is particularly significant because until this point, my scans have been progressively worse. I hope to continue this treatment in New Zealand.</p>
<h2>Support Along the Way</h2>
<p>In May 2018, I attended the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.cern-foundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network (CERN) Foundation&rsquo;s</a> Ependymoma Awareness Day and met others with ependymoma and CNS cancers. It was an honor to be there and have my mother there with me.</p>
<!-- Pullquote -->
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">My parents and family have generously supported and encouraged me in so many ways throughout my ependymoma journey. I will always be immensely grateful for their love and practical support, as well as their understanding of my preference for independence wherever possible.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Pullquote -->
<p><strong>To live as well as I can with this disease I find it helpful to be:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Proactive in my healthcare management.</li>
<li>Interested in research, medical journals, and educational websites about ependymoma and well-being.</li>
<li>Curious about the fine line between reality and hope.</li>
<li>As physically fit and healthy as possible (even if swimming and gentle physical therapy are the only options right now due to partial paralysis and difficulty mobilizing). This includes being mindful of my nutrition, hydration, sleep hygiene and holistic health.</li>
<li>Content with life, even if it shrinks to a hospital bed and what&rsquo;s within reach of it.</li>
<li>Aware of the luxury of breathing &ndash; its reassuring and tide-like momentum.</li>
<li>Accepting of help from others and to have self-compassion.</li>
<li>Able to turn toward pain and difficulties rather than away.</li>
<li>Accepting of life&rsquo;s ongoing changes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>My Hopes for NCI-CONNECT</h2>
<p>I hope that NCI-CONNECT helps patients realize they&rsquo;re not alone in their challenges. I hope it helps patients find answers to specific complications quickly and encourages participation in clinical trials. And if patients participate in a clinical trial, I hope they investigate other relevant resources at NIH. I have benefited hugely from the excellent care and exceptional work of the <a href="https://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/rmd/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rehabilitation</a> and <a href="https://clinicalcenter.nih.gov/palliativecare/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pain and palliative services</a> at NIH. Lastly, I hope NCI-CONNECT is able to create a community where patients can learn from each other and experts in the field, like I was able to during my time at NIH.</p>

<p>The holiday season is often a time of tradition and renewed hope. It also presents demands like baking, shopping, decorating, parties, visiting with family and friends, and entertaining. If you or a loved one is <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2317&amp;sys_contentid=1120689" sys_dependentvariantid="2317" sys_dependentid="1120689" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263236" sys_variantid="2317" sys_contentid="1120689">living with a brain or spine tumor</a>, the holidays may be even more stressful with doctor&rsquo;s appointments and treatments. If your loved one has passed, this can also bring up a lot of pain and cause stress. You may feel disconnected with those around you and unable to meet the demands of the season.</p>
<p>The following tips can help you cope with cancer during the holiday season and lift your spirits.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Be in tune with your thoughts and feelings.</strong> If you&rsquo;re in a happy moment and you can&rsquo;t enjoy it, take a step back to check in with yourself. Identify moments where your thoughts didn&rsquo;t match the moment. Try to find joy in happy moments, but feel free to allow yourself time to cry and reflect if you need to.</li>
<li><strong>Get support.</strong> Make a list of friends and family who you can count on to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120713" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120713" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263237" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120713">listen to your concerns</a>, make you smile or encourage you. And when you feel overwhelmed or stressed, call someone on your list for support.</li>
<li><strong>Eat healthy foods.</strong> Eat a <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=955&amp;sys_contentid=19103" sys_dependentvariantid="955" sys_dependentid="19103" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7263238" sys_variantid="955" sys_contentid="19103">balanced diet</a> that gives your body the nutrients it needs to function correctly. Limit sugary foods and alcohol to avoid dips in your energy. If you have dietary restrictions, plan your meals or eat before attending parties and events.</li>
<li><strong>Ask friends and family to help</strong>. If tradition is dinner or a gathering at your house, plan a potluck or suggest an alternative location to family and friends instead. Or use your support list to call friends and family to help you clean and prepare, wrap presents, decorate and play a role in the celebration.</li>
<li><strong>Start a new tradition</strong>. It&rsquo;s also ok to say no to your old traditions. Ask family and friends to video chat or send a personal note to communicate your holiday wishes if you don&rsquo;t have the energy to visit in person or attend an event. Plan a fun trip and go somewhere you have never been.</li>
<li><strong>Take care of yourself. </strong>Identify activities that are rewarding and make you feel good and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=5&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1037684" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1037684" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263240" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1037684">relaxed</a>. For example, walking, dancing, painting, or get a massage. Be aware of the physical stress of entertaining and traveling and do not overexert yourself. Allow yourself to take small steps to complete tasks and do what you can to preserve energy.</li>
<li><strong>Don&rsquo;t blame yourself</strong>. The things out of your control are not your fault. Be mindful of your self-blaming thoughts and instead be positive and focus on things you can actively control. The holidays are not a vacation from the challenges of living with a brain or spine tumor.</li>
<li><strong>Make a simple plan and pace yourself</strong>. Identify tasks that can cause stress, like shopping, cooking and entertaining, and plan to scale back. You can online shop, order food or ask someone to host instead. Choose the activities and situations that are most important and put those on your task list and pace yourself to complete your list. Be mindful to schedule activities when you have the most energy.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>If you have a loved one that has passed</strong>, the holidays can be especially difficult. Allow yourself to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=79&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=990&amp;sys_contentid=2236" sys_dependentvariantid="990" sys_dependentid="2236" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7263241" sys_variantid="990" sys_contentid="2236">grieve</a> and feel emotions, while also giving yourself a break by distracting yourself with activities you enjoy.</p>
<p>You can celebrate him or her by making a new tradition. Ask family and friends for input on how they want to remember this person. Some ideas include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a letter to your deceased loved one. You can share your feelings if there are unresolved issues or things left unsaid.</li>
<li>Have a candle lighting vigil or ceremony in remembrance of your loved one with a group of friends and family.</li>
<li>Support a cause close to his or her&nbsp;heart and yours.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, what is most important is to focus on the present moment and enjoy your holiday celebrations in whatever form they take. The holidays are truly about renewed hope, being thankful and sharing with family and friends.</p>

Only an estimated 140 adults are diagnosed each year in the United States, making it challenging to develop clinical trials and gather enough knowledge to treat it. Neuro-oncologist <span><a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/marta-penas-prado" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marta Penas-Prado, M.D.</a></span>, is ready to tackle this challenge to improve the lives of patients with medulloblastoma.</p>
<p>Dr. Penas-Prado recently joined the <u><a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuro-Oncology Branch</a></u> at the Center for Cancer Research, NCI, at the NIH, as an associate research physician for a program called <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=7&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120595" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120595" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263212" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120595">NCI-CONNECT</a>. The program is dedicated to improving clinical care and research for patients with adult rare CNS tumors, including medulloblastoma, an area of expertise and focus for Dr. Penas-Prado.</p>
<p>Dr. Penas-Prado has worked in neuro-oncology for the past 13 years. Her interest in studying the brain and spinal cord started during her neurology residency in Spain. She had several mentors and colleagues who were passionate about neuro-oncology and that energy transmitted to her. When she finished her residency, she did a neuro-oncology fellowship in the United States. &ldquo;I felt the need to contribute to the development of this relatively new field and to search for better therapies for patients with CNS tumors,&rdquo; says Dr. Penas-Prado.</p>
<p>She also learned there are many ways to help a patient beyond prescribing a treatment. &ldquo;We should not underestimate the power of helping patients <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121295" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121295" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263213" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121295">understand their diagnosis</a></span> by listening to their questions and concerns and answering them to the best of our knowledge,&rdquo; says Dr. Penas-Prado.</p>

<p>Her patients have taught her to live one day at a time and make the best of every day.</p>
<p>At the NIH, Dr. Penas-Prado works with the neuro-oncology team to manage the care and treatment of patients with rare brain and spine tumors and leads translational and clinical research studies, which she hopes will help her learn more about the molecular characteristics of medulloblastomas in adults.</p>
<h2><strong>Understanding the Molecular Profile of Medulloblastomas</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>Medulloblastomas are cancerous and fast-growing tumors. They form in the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046714&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046714&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">cerebellum</a>, the bottom part of the brain located at the back of the skull. Dr. Penas-Prado has a special interest in understanding the <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263214" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">natural history</a></span> and the molecular high-risk factors of adult patients with medulloblastoma and developing translational studies to investigate new therapies. This information is key to improving care and treatment and ultimately, patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the last decade, researchers have discovered that medulloblastoma is no longer a single disease and can be classified in molecular subgroups,&rdquo; explains Dr. Penas-Prado. &ldquo;Research also shows potential actionable molecular targets for some molecular subtypes, like Sonic Hedgehog activated tumors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Knowing the molecular profile or characteristics of a disease is a critical step to develop drugs to target and kill cancer cells. Developing and testing drugs in research labs is the first step to ensure the drugs are safe for a clinical trial or testing in patients and more clinical trials are needed for adult patients with medulloblastoma.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clinicians have debated for decades whether or not chemotherapy should be used in combination with radiotherapy as the first treatment for all adult patients with medulloblastoma,&rdquo; says Dr. Penas-Prado. &ldquo;Due to the lack of trials, this question remains without a definitive answer. Investigating the molecular factors to determine more aggressive tumor behavior is critical to finding out what patients need more intense therapy after they are diagnosed.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Collaborating to Find Better Therapies</strong></h2>
<p>With Dr. Penas-Prado&rsquo;s expertise, NCI-CONNECT plans to investigate the molecular risk factors for adult medulloblastoma to understand the differences in patient outcomes. &ldquo;By gathering a better understanding of the clinical course of these patients (or how the disease behaves over time) and the molecular features of their tumors, we aim to adjust the intensity of therapy to what each patient needs, improving survival and decreasing the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000693593&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000693593&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">long-term side effects</a> from treatment,&rdquo; says Dr. Penas-Prado.</p>
<p>Dr. Penas-Prado also wants to help patients in every possible way, including physically and emotionally, even when there is not a cure. She believes NCI-CONNECT will help crystalize the efforts of healthcare providers, researchers, advocacy organizations, and patients to work together on finding better therapies and further, educating and supporting patients and their families.</p>
<p>The first step is for patients to visit the NIH for an evaluation. &ldquo;We can help counsel patients on the best course of action to treat their tumors and they can help us gather the clinical and molecular information we need to learn more about their tumors and improve care,&rdquo; says Dr. Penas-Prado. Together, NCI-CONNECT and its collaborators hope to make a difference for patients.</p>

<p>The Glioma International Case-Control (GICC) study is the largest study to date examining genetic and environmental risk factors for adult gliomas. Inverse associations have been repeatedly confirmed for allergies, atopic skin diseases, and viral infections. Evaluations of these risk factors, specifically <span>ependymoma</span>, has not been completed, due to the rarity compared to other glioma types. Therefore, the purpose of this report is evaluating the associations of these confirmed glioma risk factors with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264230" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120675">ependymomas</a>.</p>
<p>128 adult ependymoma patients enrolled in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121711" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121711" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264231" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121711">NOB-ROS</a>.

Ependymoma patients exposed to these factors were calculated and compared glioma cases.</p>
<p>We have found that asthma and allergy effects may be more pronounced among ependymoma cases compared to gliomas overall. However, effects of antihistamines and anti-inflammatory drugs are much worse in ependymoma cases compared to published effects in all cases. This is the first report in adult ependymoma patients exploring risk factors reported in other gliomas and provides preliminary understanding of potential differences in ependymomas. Further analysis should be explored to identify significant areas of concern.</p>

<h2><strong>Abstract Poster: Capturing the Primary Brain Tumor (PBT) Patient's Experience of Body Image Dissatisfaction: Report from the Neuro-Oncology Branch - Natural History Study (NOB-NHS)&nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p><strong><em>Alvina Acquaye</em></strong></p>
<p>Body image dissatisfaction is associated with difficulty coping and adjustment in patients with other <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045301&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045301&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">solid tumors</a>. Although PBT patients may be at increased risk due to the visible disfigurement and debilitating nature of the disease, there is limited research in this patient group. The purpose of this report is to present the qualitative analysis of data captured on the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264232" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">NOB-NHS</a> Body Image Study.&nbsp;</p>
<p>100 patients participated by completing structured questionnaires and open-ended responses, asking: How have the changes affected you? Only 10 indicated no body image issues. Five dominant themes (lifestyle changes, symptom effects, negative &amp; positive outlook, changes in appearance) characterized participant description of body image since their diagnosis. A number of patients (28%) expressed a hindrance within their lifestyle (altered mobility, independence, activity, and changes in relationships). Participants described symptom effects (weight gain, fatigue, pain, vision changes) contributing to dissatisfaction throughout their disease. Specific changes in appearance (hair loss, indentation on head, skin dryness) were also problematic factors affecting adjustment and coping. A negative outlook (9%) (self-conscious, feeling ashamed or vulnerable) magnified awareness of long-term permanent changes, but some (8%) described the implementation of a positive outlook (using exercise and hope) allowing for acceptance of these changes.</p>
<p>These findings offer insight from the patient&rsquo;s perspective on identified physical, mental and treatment-related factors regarding body image concerns and the scope of issues faced by PBT patients. Understanding patient concerns allows for a multidimensional approach in management of key areas with the goal of improving overall <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045417&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045417&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">quality of life</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In 1973, two mothers connected for a reason they never imagined. To <a href="https://www.abta.org/about-the-abta/founders/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">start a foundation</a> in honor of their daughters with brain tumors. Micki Rae, age 6, and Stephanie, age 7, both passed away within two years of their diagnosis. But the foundation they started, the <a href="https://www.abta.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Brain Tumor Association</a> (ABTA), has thrived for nearly 46 years.</p>
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">We have an important mission to advance the understanding and treatment of brain tumors with the goal to extend and save lives.</p>
<p class="author">Ralph DeVitto</p>
</div>
<p>Ralph DeVitto is the president and chief executive officer of ABTA. He joined ABTA in February 2018 from the American Cancer Society.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see people that face a generally lethal disease with few resources and improvements in treatments compared to other cancers,&rdquo; says DeVitto. He aims to lead the organization to have a stronger voice for the patient by raising more awareness and funds.</p>
<p>To this end, ABTA is enhancing its educational and support services. It hopes to provide more information for patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals. And fund more brain tumor research. It is also collaborating with other brain tumor organizations and agencies. &nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Enhancing Patient Services and Resources </strong></h2>
<p>Founders Susan Netchin Kramer and Linda Gene Goldstein learned early in building the organization that people want information. They also want answers to questions like where to go, what to do, who to see, and how to cope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The brain tumor community is unique and passionate because brain tumors are considered rare. For malignant [cancerous] brain tumors, the disease is more challenging to treat than many other cancers given the location in the body,&rdquo; says Nicole Willmarth, Ph.D., chief mission officer of ABTA.</p>
<p>ABTA now includes over 15 patient education <a href="https://www.abta.org/about-brain-tumors/brain-tumor-faqs/publications/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">publications</a> available online. It has a <a href="https://www.abta.org/about-brain-tumors/brain-tumor-treatments-care/support-resources_page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CareLine</a> for patients and caregivers to call for support and information. It also has a program called <a href="https://www.abta.org/about-brain-tumors/brain-tumor-treatments-care/support-resources_page/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ABTA CommYOUnity&trade; Connect</a> for one-on-one support. The program uses a peer-to-peer model to match patients, survivors, and caregivers with similar experiences and situations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To date we have made over 500 matches. It is an exceptional opportunity for patients or caregivers to talk to someone who has walked in their shoes,&rdquo; says Dr. Willmarth. Another personalized service called <a href="https://app.emergingmed.com/abta/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TrialConnect</a> matches patients to available clinical trials. And <a href="https://www.inspire.com/groups/american-brain-tumor-association/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Connections</a> is ABTA&rsquo;s online support community, where brain tumor patients, survivors, and caregivers come together to share experiences and support each other.</p>
<p>ABTA also hosts free monthly educational webinars live. They are recorded so they can be accessed anytime from its <a href="https://www.abta.org/about-brain-tumors/brain-tumor-faqs/webinars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learning library</a>. Topics range from treatment and managing symptoms to quality of life and diet information. NCI-CONNECT Associate Research Physician <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/marta-penas-prado" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marta Penas-Prado, M.D.</a>, presented a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LscS6geGB94&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">webinar on chemotherapy</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>ABTA also includes a brain tumor center listing and support group listing to help patients find the best care and support in their community. &ldquo;We continue to expand our services in hopes of providing even more resources and information for people in need,&rdquo; says Dr. Willmarth.</p>
<p>More, ABTA holds a <span><a href="https://www.abta.org/event/patient-family-conference/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Patient and Family Conference</a></span> each year in the United States. It also has a robust <span><a href="https://www.abta.org/get-involved/volunteer-with-the-abta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">volunteer services program</a></span>. People interested in volunteering are mentored, trained, and matched with services to help the brain tumor community.</p>
<h2><strong>Partnering to Improve Patient Outcomes</strong></h2>
<p>In May 2018, <span>ABTA </span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264222" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121675">partnered with NCI-CONNECT</a> to help identify and engage patients with select rare central nervous system tumors through awareness and education. The partnership brings together non-profit brain and spine tumor organizations to work collaboratively to improve patient outcomes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What NCI-CONNECT is doing is admirable. It&rsquo;s hard to get enough information on rare tumors to move the needle,&rdquo; says Dr. Willmarth. &ldquo;Bringing rare tumors to the forefront means they won&rsquo;t be forgotten. And the knowledge gained could be expanded to all brain tumor types.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DeVitto is also excited to roll-up his sleeves and work with other brain tumor organizations. &ldquo;We are thankful that NCI-CONNECT is hosting workshops to bring together neuro-oncology experts from all areas and include the advocacy voice. Together, we can do more to make an impact in brain cancer treatment and care, and give people a reason to hope,&rdquo; he says. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Like most <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120679" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120679" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263263" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120679">oligodendroglioma</a> patient stories, ours started with the shock of the diagnosis on August 1, 2008.&nbsp;Our 16-year-old son, Spencer, was experiencing <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044499&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">focal</a> seizures in his right arm when he played soccer.&nbsp;After months of eliminating possible causes, an MRI confirmed a brain tumor called an oligodendroglioma the size of lemon in his <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120672" sys_contentid="1120672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="2297" sys_relationshipid="7263260" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1120672" sys_dependentvariantid="2297">right frontal lobe</a>.</p>
<p>Two days later, Spencer had surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible.&nbsp;We spent the next 20 months doing the MRI thing, hoping that the tumor would stay quiet for a long time. In April 2010, he had another focal seizure and was put on chemotherapy for a year.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In June, before Spencer started <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000507640&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000507640&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">Temodar</a>, an oral chemotherapy drug, we took a family vacation to Mexico. A few hours after arriving, our older son, Zach, then age 21, had a grand mal seizure.&nbsp;It was the scariest experience of my life. We returned home and the MRI revealed that Zach also had an oligodendroglioma.&nbsp;Fortunately, they removed &ldquo;all&rdquo; of his tumor.</p>
<p>As with most oligodendroglioma survivors, the medical story didn&rsquo;t end there &ndash; far from it. Since then, both boys have had a recurrence and a second surgery followed by proton therapy and chemotherapy. And more recently, Spencer&rsquo;s MRI showed apparent growth, so he has been on a clinical trial targeting the IDH1 gene, for about a year. Both boys are on the <a class="definition" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000766471&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000766471&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">ketogenic diet</a>.</p>
<p>But, we are lucky. Both boys are doing well and living their lives with few limitations &ndash; other than having to live near a top brain tumor center. Zach recently received his doctorate in physics from Columbia University in New York and is looking to put all that knowledge to work. Spencer lives in the San Francisco Bay Area and works for a healthcare provider.</p>
<h2>The Personal Journey</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t honestly think there&rsquo;s a way for others to really understand what something like this does to your life and outlook. The grieving process often begins at diagnosis. And going through the five stages of grief isn&rsquo;t pretty &ndash; and I doubt I will ever get to acceptance. Over time, I have found it possible to be positive and continue to lead a full life, but there&rsquo;s no escaping the sense of dread of the future.</p>
<!-- Pullquote -->
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">And our family has gotten better at dealing with our reality. At the beginning, we didn&rsquo;t understand much about this disease, and we were somewhat afraid to find out more. Each new medical setback would plunge us into the fearful unknown. But we came to accept that in one way or another, we would find our way through it.</p>
</div>
<!-- End Pullquote -->
<p>Without a doubt, the biggest factor in our coping with and, to some extent, overcoming the negatives of our situation has been the work we have done with Oligo Nation to advance research. Instead of feeling helpless in the face of a currently incurable disease, we are energized and excited about the progress and opportunities ahead. Two years ago, I moved from hopeful to optimistic, which might not sound like much, but it is a huge difference.</p>
<p>On a different level, the support we have received and continue to receive from friends, family and others has been beyond belief. Our family is amazed and humbled by the love that we feel.</p>
<p>The final thing is that I know that we are lucky. Both our boys are alive and (mostly) well. Being grateful for what we have is more powerful than grieving over what we have lost.</p>
<h2>Getting Involved</h2>
<p>Having two kids with brain cancer was more than I could handle initially. But after a few months, I picked myself up off the floor. I remembered my father saying that &ldquo;Greenes don&rsquo;t take bad news lying down.&rdquo; I realized I had to do anything and everything in my power to &ldquo;save&rdquo; my boys. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But where to start? I donated to a brain tumor foundation. Then, I checked their website and realized they weren&rsquo;t funding any oligodendroglioma research.&nbsp;I checked other brain tumor foundations &ndash; no oligodendroglioma research. So, I called to see what could be done.&nbsp;They told me that they would create a dedicated oligodendroglioma research fund. We were successful over three years, but, ultimately, it was clear to me that this non-profit was not going to solve our problem.</p>
<p>Believe me, it was never our plan to run our own non-profit. But in early 2014, I jumped in all the way and created <a href="http://www.oligonation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Oligo Nation</a>. It was going to have to be the vehicle to deliver the new treatments my family and thousands of others needed. The priority was to get others in the oligodendroglioma community involved to support research and bring awareness to this disease.</p>
<p>It took us several years to build up our war chest, but in 2016, we started making grants for medical research.&nbsp;Over the past few years we have made 10 grants and have raised the visibility of oligodendroglioma research with leading institutions. Having money to invest is critical, but a lot of good things have happened by just asking, &ldquo;How does your work apply to oligodendroglioma?&rdquo;</p>
<p>One other area that has been of increasing importance &ndash; acting as a resource for others in the oligodendroglioma community as they try to navigate a difficult and sometimes confusing landscape of treatment options, second opinions, and insurance hurdles.</p>
<p>My family is committed 100%, every day of the year. That&rsquo;s why we are excited to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263264" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121675">partner</a> with the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s new program called <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=943&amp;sys_contentid=1120587" sys_contentid="1120587" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="943" sys_relationshipid="7263261" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1120587" sys_dependentvariantid="943">NCI-CONNECT</a>, which is focusing on selected rare adult central nervous system cancers, including oligodendroglioma. I believe that combining efforts the NIH, non-profits and the research institutions is an approach that will have a positive impact on improving care and treatment for patients.</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p><strong></strong>My brain tumor story started when I was a junior in high school in Midland, Texas &ndash; although, I didn&rsquo;t know it at the time. I had multiple concussions playing football and after my fourth concussion, the team trainer recommended that I get an MRI. The MRI showed a small spot on my brain that the doctors initially thought was cortical <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045675&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045675&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">dysplasia</a> &ndash; a birth defect of abnormal cells or tissue &ndash; and decided to monitor it every six months with follow-up scans. &nbsp;Thankfully, I&rsquo;ve never had any of the typical brain tumor symptoms like headaches, seizures, cognitive impairments or loss of physical functioning.</p>
<p>Life proceeded as normal. I graduated high school and started college in the fall of 2009 at Texas A&amp;M University in College Station, Texas. While at home on college winter break, I had a routine MRI. But this time, the spot had grown and my doctor recommended surgery. The doctors said the surgery could wait until the summer as the tumor had not grown by much. But, after talking it over with my family, we decided it would be best for me to go ahead and withdraw from school and proceed with surgery. On February 8, 2010, at age 19, I had my first brain surgery to remove the tumor from my left <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120672" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263165" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120672">frontal lobe</a>. Shortly afterwards, I learned I had a type of cancerous brain tumor called <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120679" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120679" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263161" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120679">anaplastic oligodendroglioma</a>. Although it stunk to get this diagnosis, there was a silver lining. My tumor contained a deleted <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046470&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046470&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">chromosome</a> 1P/19q, which made it more susceptible to treatment.</p>
<h2>Finding Expert Care</h2>
<p>Since oligodendrogliomas are a rare brain cancer, my neurosurgeons referred me to Mark Gilbert, M.D., who at the time was a neuro-oncologist in Houston experienced in treating rare tumors. At 19-years-old, I trusted Dr. Gilbert to give me the best available treatments for my specific tumor type.</p>
<p>I started two years of oral chemotherapy. I took the drug <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045387&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045387&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">temozolomide</a> for five days and then was off the drug for 21 days. Thankfully, I only experienced some nausea during the time of treatment and was able to return to college while undergoing treatment. I was able to graduate with my Bachelor of Business Administration in Finance in 2013 and then earned my Master of Real Estate Finance in 2014, both at Texas A&amp;M University. I then moved to Houston for a job, but after seven months decided to return to Midland to get into the oil and gas business, which turned out to be a huge blessing.</p>
<p>After my first bout with brain cancer, I had an MRI every other month until I was cleared to have scans every six months in Houston. At one of the routine brain scans, a spot re-appeared in my left frontal lobe. I decided that it would be best for me to see <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/mark-r-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Gilbert</a>, again, now a neuro-oncologist in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121717" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121717" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263164" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121717">Neuro-Oncology Branch</a> at the Center for Cancer Research, NCI, NIH in Bethesda, Maryland. At 24-years-old, I trusted him with my life and still do today.</p>
<h2>Treating My Brain Cancer Recurrence</h2>
<p>New tests confirmed the anaplastic oligodendroglioma was back. Therefore, I needed to have my second brain surgery. My second surgery was at the NIH with <a href="https://neuroscience.nih.gov/ninds/Faculty/Profile/kareem-zaghloul.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kareem Zaghloul, M.D., Ph.D.,</a> of the National Institutes of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, on August 28, 2015 (my older brothers&rsquo; birthday). Dr. Zaghloul and his team performed a flawless surgery. It went so well that I gave the team a fist bump as I was being carted out of the operating room.</p>
<p>Starting September 2015, my mom and I moved up to Bethesda for me to undergo six weeks of radiation at the NIH. During that time, I had countless care packages and visitors. From my girlfriend, Kristin, who is now my wife, to my dad and brother, I will forever be eternally grateful that God blessed me with such wonderful friends and family. After completing radiation, I returned home to Midland. I had a one month break before starting oral chemotherapy of two drugs, <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000728320&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000728320&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">CCNU</a> and <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045378&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045378&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">Procarbazine</a>, for five months. During this time, I visited my local oncologist weekly for check-ups and blood work. In addition, I traveled to the NIH every other month for blood work, MRIs, and the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263162" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">Natural History Study</a>.</p>
<p>During my treatments, I experienced nausea from chemotherapy, I lost my speech for almost three weeks following my first brain surgery, and had brain swelling from radiation. After my treatments finished, I was often tired, and it took over a year for me to feel like I had all my energy back and to feel completely like myself again. My brain scans have now been clear since August 2015. Praise the Lord!&nbsp;</p>
<h2>My Advice and Hope</h2>
<!-- Pullquote -->
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">I am thankful that God blessed me with a caring and supportive family &ndash; my wife, parents and brother. All my prayer warriors and my families&rsquo; love is truly humbling. I am thankful for each breath I get to take and my second chance at life. And even more rewarding, I am expecting a baby boy in January 2019.&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<!-- End Pullquote -->
<p>I want to tell people don&rsquo;t ever quit and don&rsquo;t ever give up hope. Don&rsquo;t ever ask yourself, "Why is this happening to me?" Trust that the Lord above knows what he&rsquo;s doing. I have two Bible verses that I leaned on while going through my struggles. Isaiah 55:8-9: &ldquo;For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways,&rdquo; declares the Lord. &ldquo;For just as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts higher than your thoughts.&rdquo; Jeremiah 29:11: &ldquo;For I know the plans I have for you, declares the Lord, plans to make you prosper and not to harm you, to give you a future and a hope.&rdquo; &nbsp;Always remember you may not be able to change your outcome, but you can ask for God&rsquo;s help and trust in Him to see you through the hard times. I try not to let myself get caught up in the little things or the everyday worries, I do my best to try and see the bigger picture every day.</p>
<p>I ultimately hope that NCI-CONNECT finds a cure for cancer and brings awareness to the care they provide at the NIH for free. Eliminating the cost burden on patients is significant. I will continue my follow-up care at the NIH and to be thankful for the life I live, which I hope remains cancer-free.</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>In 2007, my daughter, Chelsea, was your average 13-year-old girl. She started a new school and liked music and going to concerts with her father. Chelsea was a very caring seventh grader and made friends easily.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Near the end of the school year, my parents, who saw Chelsea every day after school, shared that she was napping each day for hours. She also had frequent headaches and a concerning vomiting episode. We visited her pediatrician who recommended a CT scan based on her symptoms, but we were not at all concerned. Less than two hours later, on June 7, the pediatrician called. Chelsea needed to go to the emergency room and see a neurologist. We were also told to bring clothes because she would not be coming home. I was an emotional disaster.</p>
<p>Chelsea had a golf ball-sized tumor in the <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120672" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263202" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120672">lower part of her brain</a></span>&nbsp;that required next-day surgery. Five days after surgery, we found out the tumor was a type of rare brain cancer called <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120677" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120677" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263203" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120677">medulloblastoma</a></span>. That was the worst day of my life. We were apprehensive to share the news with Chelsea. She was undergoing physical and occupational therapy and unable to talk at this point, so felt we needed to wait. Two weeks later, we told her that she had cancer and the tumor was gone but she needed more treatments to make sure that it didn&rsquo;t come back.</p>
<h2><strong>The Impacts of Treatments</strong></h2>
<p>Physical and occupational therapy went well for Chelsea and she started radiation therapy three weeks after surgery. She had 31 treatments to her brain and spine. To celebrate radiation ending, she watched the debut of <em>High School Musical 2 </em>with her friends.</p>
<p>Chelsea had in-home teachers in eighth grade because she was starting chemotherapy with the drugs <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046017&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046017&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">Lomustine</a> and <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045230&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045230&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">Cisplatin</a> and we knew it could make her very tired and sick. After five rounds of chemotherapy, it was stopped because there was concern over hearing loss.</p>
<p>We were relieved the treatments were over, but we noticed the lasting cognitive effects. There were changes to her thought process, which are difficult for all of us to navigate. We had to learn to adjust and be patient and that Chelsea needs a plan and structure. I have also learned how to help her organize her thoughts, while fostering her independence.</p>
<p>Emotionally, I had a lot of rough days at the beginning. I cried a lot, but my husband and Chelsea stayed strong. Chelsea&rsquo;s worst day was when we had to shave her head because now, she&rsquo;d look sick.</p>
<h2><strong>Trying to Return to a &ldquo;Normal&rdquo; Life</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>In ninth grade, Chelsea returned to school part-time, but nothing was like what it was before. She only went to the core classes because of her exhaustion. She went back full-time in tenth grade and realized that most of her friends had changed. School was now socially very difficult, and this continued in college.</p>
<p>In August 2014, she had a recurrence and was unable to go back to college due to her treatment regimen. The medulloblastoma spread to her frontal lobe and base of her spine. Because the tumor was so big in the frontal lobe, her only treatment option was chemotherapy for one year followed by 28 rounds of radiation therapy to the head and spine. After treatments, Chelsea&rsquo;s scans were clear, and she returned to college in 2016 for two semesters. &nbsp;</p>

<p>In June 2017, her scans revealed her cancer was back, again. Thankfully, her professors let her study at home, and she graduated in December 2017 while undergoing chemotherapy treatments to prevent any further growth.</p>
<h2><strong>Seeking Out Clinical Trials</strong></h2>
<p>Now, at age 24, Chelsea&rsquo;s medulloblastoma tumors are growing and she is too old for the available pediatric clinical trials at our current hospital. With limited options, our doctor suggested we spend quality time with Chelsea.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a determined friend searched for medulloblastoma clinical trials, which led us to the NIH, where Chelsea would be treated as an adult and enroll in a clinical trial.</p>
<p>We were overwhelmed by the turnaround time and professionalism at the NIH. We met with <u><a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/mark-r-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gilbert, M.D.</a></u>, chief, and Christine Siegel, nurse practitioner, of the <u><a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuro-Oncology Branch</a></u> at the Center for Cancer Research, NCI, at the NIH for a consultation and learned about an <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263204" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">immunotherapy clinical trial</a></span> for rare tumors.</p>
<p>After two months on the trial, the treatment was not working. The NIH team remained optimistic and Chelsea had a biopsy by NIH <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046269&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046269&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">neurosurgeon</a> <span><a href="https://www.ninds.nih.gov/Funding/Training-Career-Development/High-School-Undergraduate-Post-Baccalaureate/Summer-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edjah Ndoum, M.D.</a></span> We learned Chelsea&rsquo;s tumor subtype is a <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120677" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120677" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7263205" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120677">group 4 (non-WNT / non-SHH)</a></span> medulloblastoma and the doctors recommended a trial at St. Jude Children&rsquo;s Research Hospital specific to her tumor subtype.</p>
<p>On July 31, 2018, after one-and-a-half years of no effective treatments for her medulloblastoma, Chelsea joined the <span><a href="https://www.stjude.org/research/clinical-trials/sjdawn-brain-tumor.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SJDAWN trial</a></span>, and so far her cancer is stable.</p>
<h2><strong>Appreciating the Bad Days and Good People</strong></h2>
<p>Over the past 11 years, medulloblastoma has significantly impacted Chelsea&rsquo;s life. It has been rough for her to work, drive, go to school, make friends and find love. Her personality seems unchanged, though, and she shares, &ldquo;The bad things that happen are relative. Bad days are bad days. Either a breakup or cancer. But my bad days always win.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We appreciate the amazing people in our lives who have helped us and how our medulloblastoma journey has brought our family closer. Who knows where we would be without my determined friend and the optimism and resources at the NIH.</p>

<p>In 2018, at age 59, I owned a law practice, was in good health and had no reason to believe I had a brain tumor. Then, in late March, I began having headaches in the morning and minor issues with short-term memory, such as forgetting names. One night, I was at home with my 15-year-old daughter and her friend and they thought that I was acting strange. Later that night, my daughter heard me fall. I had passed out and was throwing up.</p>
<p>I went to the doctor and he knew something was wrong. He ordered a CT scan, and everything next happened so quickly. I was admitted to the hospital for a brain tumor. There, doctors discovered I had <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045498&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045498&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">hydrocephalus</a> or fluid buildup in the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045939&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045939&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">ventricles</a> of my brain from the tumor. A neurosurgeon came to the hospital to perform a biopsy of my tumor to remove a small piece of the tumor for a <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046244&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046244&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">pathologist</a> to examine. He also poked a hole in one of the ventricles to enable the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046483&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046483&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">cerebrospinal fluid</a> to flow out of my brain.</p>
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">I am thankful for the expert neurosurgeon now, although I didn&rsquo;t think about it at the time.</p>
</div>
<p>The procedures took about one-and-a-half hours. Afterwards, the neurosurgeon explained that he would be unable to remove all the brain tumor because it was adjacent to the <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120672" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264205" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120672">brainstem</a></span> and too risky.</p>
<p>Five days later, before I was discharged, the neurosurgeon shared that he thought my tumor was a <span>papillary <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120680" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120680" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264206" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120680">tumor in the pineal region</a></span>. Fortunately, my tumor didn&rsquo;t appear cancerous, but is an extremely rare type of brain tumor.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I met with a neuro-oncologist about other <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121723" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121723" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264207" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121723">treatment</a> options. The plan was to do CyberKnife radiation, a type of robotic radiation therapy commonly used when tumors are inoperable or too risky to remove with surgery. After three days of radiation, the tumor shrunk in half. The worst side-effect was the 30-pound weight gain caused by the steroids to treat the cranial pressure.</p>
<h2><strong>Seeking a Second Opinion for Reassurance</strong></h2>
<p>A few of my doctor friends recommended I seek a second opinion. I met with another neuro-oncologist who agreed that after radiation the treatment plan should be to monitor my tumor with scans every three months. But I did more research online. I learned the odds of a <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046675&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046675&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">pineal region tumor</a> returning were very likely. I then searched for clinical studies and found rare central nervous system (CNS) tumor <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264208" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">studies</a></span> by NCI-CONNECT at the NIH.</p>
<p>In September, I visited the NCI <span><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/nci/rare-brain-spine-tumor/refer-participate/referrals" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuro-Oncology Branch</a></span> and met with Nurse Practitioner <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1127193" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1127193" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264209" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1127193">Christine Siegel</a></span> and Neuro-oncologist <span><a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/marta-penas-prado" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marta Penas-Prado, M.D.</a></span> I enrolled in an <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000286105&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000286105&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">observational study</a> called the Natural History Study. I was happy to join so I could learn more about my tumor and help future research.</p>
<p>In November, I began having headaches and went to my local hospital for an MRI. Thankfully, my tumor was stable, but had changed form due to radiation. The remaining tumor involves the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044353&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000044353&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">thalamus</a>, which causes bad headaches. At my follow-up appointment with Dr. Penas-Prado, she reassured me the tumor was behaving and my brain was adjusting to the presence of it. We talked about other treatment options, but she reassured me that if I am showing no signs of brain tumor regrowth, the best option is monitoring. &nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Learning Not to Panic</strong></h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t dwell on the fact that I have an inoperable brain tumor. I continue to stay busy with work and spend quality time with my family. I live a full life despite my brain tumor. I&rsquo;m in touch with the best doctors and that is all I can do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Until I found NCI-CONNECT, I didn&rsquo;t know anyone else with this brain tumor type. For others with a papillary pineal region tumor, don&rsquo;t panic! Procedures are evolving. Be positive and never give up hope. It&rsquo;s also important to do your research, seek a second opinion and find an expert care team so you can continue to live life to the fullest.</p>

<p>Each year, an <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120680" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120680" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264215" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120680">estimated 81 adults</a></span> are diagnosed with a <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046675&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046675&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">pineal region tumor</a> in the United States. These tumors are a type of rare central nervous system tumor that form in the pineal region of the brain. To better understand these extremely rare tumors, NCI-CONNECT is collaborating with clinicians across disciplines. This includes <span><a href="https://neuroscience.nih.gov/ninds/Faculty/Profile/prashant-chittiboina.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prashant Chittiboina, M.D.</a></span>, assistant clinical investigator and neurosurgeon at the National Institutes of Neurologic Disorders and Stroke at NIH.</p>
<p>Dr. Chittiboina joined NIH in 2012 as a fellow, becoming a staff clinician in the Surgical Neurology Branch in 2013. He became an assistant clinical investigator in 2015. He specializes in treating patients with rare pituitary and skull base tumors and complex spinal cord tumors. This includes pineal region tumors and ependymomas in the brain stem and spinal cord.</p>
<p>His laboratory studies neurosurgical disorders of the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046229&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046229&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">pituitary gland</a> and disorders arising from inheritable tumor syndromes. His current work is focused on changing the outcomes of neurosurgical disorders through improved imaging.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a very exciting time for my research because of the focus on rare cancers, which are very challenging to accurately diagnose and successfully treat,&rdquo; says Dr. Chittiboina.</p>
<p>As a pituitary and skull base neurosurgeon, Dr. Chittiboina treats complex and complicated tumors that are often hard to completely remove. He partners with neuro-oncologists, like <span><a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/mark-r-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gilbert, M.D.</a></span>, chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch and co-leader of NCI-CONNECT at NIH, to develop further treatment strategies. What Dr. Chittiboina learns in his clinical practice then informs his research.</p>
<h2><strong>Treating Pineal Region Tumors </strong></h2>
<p>&ldquo;Pineal region tumors are a special category of deep tumors of the brain,&rdquo; explains Dr. Chittiboina. &ldquo;They are in the skull-base area, so we use specialized surgical techniques to reach and remove the tumors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The pineal region is located deep in the middle of the brain. <span><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/nci/rare-brain-spine-tumor/tumors/pineal-region-tumors">Pineal region tumors</a></span> arise from cells that form the pineal gland or from the cells of the surrounding tissue. They are grouped in four grades and various subtypes based on their cell of origin and other characteristics.</p>
<p>To treat pineal region tumors, doctors first review the imaging very carefully. &ldquo;Serial imaging helps us confidently determine if the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046324&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046324&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">lesion</a> is a cancerous tumor or benign [non-cancerous] cyst,&rdquo; says Dr. Chittiboina. If it is a tumor, doctors perform additional testing of blood and spinal fluid to look for <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=26&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=690&amp;sys_contentid=323202" sys_dependentvariantid="690" sys_dependentid="323202" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7264218" sys_variantid="690" sys_contentid="323202">markers</a></span> that may help further plan for treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because there are at least six common types of tumors in the pineal region and within those 20 different subtypes, the markers are very helpful to determine the correct course of treatment,&rdquo; explains Dr. Chittiboina. &ldquo;For example, researchers have discovered six or seven markers that indicate a tumor will respond better to upfront radiation therapy before surgery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Pineal region tumors are challenging to remove surgically. They lie in the dead center of the brain, so they are the furthest structure from the surface and hard to reach &ndash; no matter the approach. And to complicate matters, the pineal region is surrounded by big blood vessels.</p>
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">Until the 1950s, pineal region tumors were considered inoperable. Now, as experienced neurosurgeons, we understand how to safely remove the tumors when possible.</p>
<p class="author">Dr. Chittiboina</p>
</div>
<p>&ldquo;In a few benign tumors, if surgery is successful, many patients never need further treatment. Unfortunately, most patients need additional therapy such as the ones provided by Dr. Gilbert&rsquo;s team.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There are two main challenges to successfully treating pineal region tumors: removing the tumors safely and treating the remaining tumor or a recurrence effectively.</p>
<h2><strong>Partnering to Study Rare Tumors</strong></h2>
<p>Dr. Chittiboina and his research team are investigating better methods to diagnose and treat pineal region, skull base, pituitary and other rare tumors using imaging and molecular data. Their recent research has shown using newer imaging strategies, including a <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046218&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046218&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">positron emission tomography (PET) scan</a> and special <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045997&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045997&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">magnetic resonance imaging</a> (MRI), they&rsquo;re better able to detect the tumors.</p>
<p>The researchers are then using tissue taken during surgery to study the molecular characteristics of the tumor. &ldquo;The goal is to figure out new ways to attack these rare tumors without hurting normal brain functioning,&rdquo; says Dr. Chittiboina. &ldquo;For instance, we may be able to start a drug trial using already approved medications for other cancers based on our findings.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Chittiboina is partnering with NCI-CONNECT to care for patients with rare brain and spine tumors. &ldquo;This is a fruitful time in patient care and research,&rdquo; says Dr. Chittiboina. &ldquo;We are collaborating in patient care with Dr. Gilbert and his team to determine the best treatment strategies and services for patients with rare tumors.&rdquo; Dr. Gilbert is also leading <span><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=13&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264216" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">rare brain and spine tumor studies</a></span>.</p>
<p>This means more patients with these rare tumors will visit the NIH Clinical Center. For pineal region tumors, the increase could be impactful. &ldquo;The volume of patients will enable our research. We have two new studies opening soon &ndash; a surgical imaging study and a drug trial,&rdquo; says Dr. Chittiboina. &ldquo;We hope patients will participate because we strive every day to do ground breaking research and focus on what is important to advance our understanding of these cancers and offer patients experienced service.&rdquo;</p>

Claus, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, professor and director of Medical Research at Yale University School of Public Health, and a neurosurgeon in the Department of Neurosurgery at Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital (BWH) in Boston, has created a web-based registry for patients with low-grade gliomas (LGG), a group of tumors that includes oligodendroglioma, called <a href="http://abta.pub30.convio.net/brain-tumor-research/low-grade-glioma-registry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The International Low Grade Glioma Registry</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">The overarching goal of the registry, which seeks to enroll a minimum of 2,000 low-grade glioma patients, is to allow for focused study of low-grade gliomas to develop effective treatments. Currently, patients are enrolled from 21 states and nine countries.</p>
<p class="author">Dr. Claus</p>
</div>
<h2><strong>The Inception of the LGG Registry </strong></h2>
<p>Dr. Claus trained as a neurosurgeon at Yale-New Haven Hospital and completed a fellowship in neurosurgical oncology at BWH; her clinical expertise is in the treatment of glioma, meningioma, and brain metastases. Dr. Claus' research is focused in cancer and genetic <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000257225&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000257225&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">epidemiology</a> with an emphasis on the development of risk models for breast and brain tumors. She has served as the overall principal investigator of the Meningioma Consortium, the Meningioma Genome-Wide Association Study, and as a co-investigator of the GLIOGENE (Genes for Glioma) and International Glioma Case/Control (GICC) projects. More recently, Dr. Claus has turned her attention to the study of low-grade gliomas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My interest in LGG and oligodendroglioma began during my fellowship at Brigham and Women&rsquo;s Hospital. During that year, most of my time was spent operating on patients with LGG using the BWH Magnetic Resonance Intraoperative Suite and studying the ability of such technology to improve outcomes for patients with LGG,&rdquo; says Dr. Claus. &ldquo;And despite advances in surgical techniques and improvements in diagnostic classification, the management of LGG tumors, such as oligodendroglioma, remains one of the most controversial topics in neuro-oncology.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The good news, Dr. Claus explains, is that the development of secure web- and smartphone-based research tools<sup> </sup>and partnership with patient organizations allows scientists to enroll patients on research projects and share the results with them with greater ease. With funding from the American Brain Tumor Association, National Brain Tumor Society, and LOGLIO Collective, Dr. Claus developed the LGG registry.</p>
<h2><strong>What the LGG Registry Hopes to Achieve</strong></h2>
<p>One goal of the registry is to learn more about LGG cells. &ldquo;An understanding of the evolution of the LGG <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044593&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000044593&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">genome</a> will help identify and characterize the glioma cells driving resistance to treatment, knowledge that will be important for the development of and optimal timing for effective therapies,&rdquo; says Dr. Claus.</p>
<p>Her research team is also interested in measuring the impact of treatment on quality of life and neurocognition. &ldquo;Patients with oligodendroglioma are typically young when diagnosed &ndash; average age is 41 &ndash; and survive a long time, making quality of life, neurocognition and reducing fatigue all important clinical goals,&rdquo; says Dr. Claus. Yet, very little is known about the impact of treatment, particularly radiation therapy, on patients&rsquo; ability to return to work, drive and participate in their usual activities.</p>
<p>In addition, because oligodendrogliomas are rare tumors, it's challenging to recruit patients to participate and provide access to the project. &ldquo;That is why NCI-CONNECT is so important for oligodendroglioma,&rdquo; says Dr. Claus. &ldquo;Its partnership with our registry, as well as with other researchers and patient organizations with an interest in oligodendroglioma, is key to the successful study of this disease. NCI-CONNECT provides a supportive centralized mechanism to keep patients apprised of opportunities to join new or ongoing studies as well as to support researchers in their efforts to reach patients, gather and share data, and form new collaborations. We look forward to working with NCI-CONNECT to help support patients with oligodendroglioma.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Being a caregiver to a patient with a brain or spine tumor is an important and challenging role. Caregivers are so often focused on the medical, physical and emotional needs of their loved one, they forget to care for themselves. But caregivers, your health and wellness are important, too.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to make caregiver self-care a priority. Doing so can help you as a caregiver manage your needs in a healthy way to avoid stress, burn-out, sickness and fatigue. It will also ensure you find a good balance between caring for your loved one and yourself.</p>
<p>Here are our self-care tips for caregivers of patients with a brain or spine tumor. We encourage you to follow these tips to stay healthy.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Schedule self-care time</strong>: Each day or week make time to focus on your needs. Make it a priority by scheduling a recurring one-hour appointment with yourself. Your self-care time should include an activity you enjoy or event that provides comfort. Exercise, go shopping, meditate, have coffee with a friend, or take a nap. The scheduled time will rejuvenate you and help you make your physical and mental health a priority. Your loved one needs you healthy, too.
<ul>
<li>For any of the activities that you incorporate into a consistent routine, make sure you stay in the moment and enjoy yourself. You can think about anything you need to get done after you have taken this time for you.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Write-down your positive qualities</strong>: Show yourself self-love by writing down the qualities that make you a great caregiver and person. This can help build your self-esteem and help you stay motivated. Here is an activity to try:
<ul>
<li>Write the letters of the alphabet. Find one positive quality about yourself for each letter. Write it next to the letter. Keep this list handy and refer to it when you need a mental boost.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Make a self-care emergency plan:</strong> Having a plan can help you when you feel overwhelmed. In these moments, it can be difficult to think of things to do for yourself. The plan keeps you ready with a list of things you can do to stay calm and in control of how you feel. You can also include things to avoid that might make you feel worse. And keep this plan in a place where you see it consistently. Your plan should include:
<ul>
<li>A list of activities that help you relax. For example, take a 30-minute walk or meditate for 10 minutes.&nbsp;Include activities that boost your mood and tips to remind you to stay calm and in the moment. And remember to breathe.&nbsp;</li>
<li>A list of people to reach out to for help or support, such as a friend or loved one that can provide comfort or distraction, or groups to attend to meet other caregivers.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Positive messages to say to yourself to keep you motivated.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Caregivers, remember, your health and wellness are as important as your loved one. And your loved one wants and needs you healthy, too. So, we encourage you to take care of yourself today and every day</p>

<p>In March 2007, the <a href="https://www.cern-foundation.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Collaborative Ependymoma Research Network (CERN) Foundation</a> held its first meeting. Clinicians, researchers, and family of ependymoma survivor, Dallas Mathile, gathered to discuss how they could impact the lives of people with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264102" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120675">ependymoma</a>, a rare central nervous system (CNS) cancer.</p>
<p>This effort was led by neuro-oncologist Mark Gilbert, M.D., now chief of NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Neuro-Oncology Branch, who asked other experts willing to collaborate to join him. <a href="https://www.cern-foundation.org/about/the-cern-team">These leaders</a> continue to be CERN advisors today. And the effort to start the foundation was and generously supported by the Mathile family.</p>
<p>Among the attendees at the first CERN meeting was Kimberly Wallgren, Dallas&rsquo; daughter. &ldquo;We knew then we needed to put a community framework around this rare disease and tell the story of what researchers were doing,&rdquo; says <a href="https://www.cern-foundation.org/about/spotlight/kim-wallgren" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallgren</a>, now president of the CERN Foundation. &ldquo;It was so hopeful to know there were extremely talented and dedicated people committed to investigating ependymoma and looking for innovative ways to engage the rare disease community.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The CERN Foundation quickly became the premier resource for people living with ependymoma. It offers patients and families educational and clinical trials information, support resources, and ways to participate.</p>
<h2><strong>Building Awareness and Outreach</strong></h2>
<p>Wallgren knew the first step to reaching people and creating a community was to build a platform for people to interact and communicate critical information. Thus, the CERN Foundation launched a website. It immediately became the go-to for patients newly diagnosed through recurrence and survivorship. It remains to be a top resource today.</p>
<p>Wallgren also knew the website needed to focus on the individual experience of ependymoma. She understands first hand that families will first want to learn about their diagnosis. More, they will want to &nbsp;understand ependymoma terminology.</p>
<p>Wallgren&rsquo;s father was first diagnosed in 2002 and had a recurrence in 2006. &ldquo;When my dad was first diagnosed, there was almost no information available and my parents were grasping for anything about the disease. Not much turned up, &rdquo; says Wallgren.</p>
<p>The website specifically includes <a href="https://www.cern-foundation.org/education" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">educational information</a> on ependymoma basics, diagnosis, treatments, clinical trials, recurrence, symptom management, support and resources. And it provides all of that information in a <a href="https://www.cern-foundation.org/education/ependymoma-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free ependymoma guide</a> for patients, caregivers, and advocates.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a major trust factor that we establish with visitors to our website. And we don&rsquo;t hold that responsibility lightly,&rdquo; says Wallgren. &ldquo;We do our best to communicate important information in an easy to understand manor in order to empower family and friends along their experience with the disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The website includes referral information to help families find the best care for their loved one. This includes helping families get a second opinion, so they can understand available treatment and clinical trial options. Wallgren personally communicates with patients and families. She answers questions and helps people navigate finding second opinions at centers with a neuro-oncology program that meets their needs. The foundation utilizes its network of physicians and centers to refer patients.</p>
<p>The CERN Foundation also facilitates physician to physician consultations through its network. &ldquo;CERN has a collaborative spirit and we expect that from our team members. Our intent is to serve both the pediatric and adult patient and medical communities,&rdquo; says Wallgren.</p>
<p>Last, people living with ependymoma want to connect with others going through the same experience. The CERN Foundation is active on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/CERNFoundation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/CERNfoundation" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>, <a href="https://www.cern-foundation.org/awareness/stories" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shares inspirational stories</a>, and hosts an awareness day event.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Getting the Community Involved</strong></h2>
<p>Ependymoma Awareness Day started in 2012 with a mass butterfly release taking place at the semi-annual CERN Foundation investigator meeting. The annual <a href="https://www.cern-foundation.org/awareness/event/ependymoma-awareness-day-2019" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ependymoma Awareness Day</a>, now in its eighth year and taking place in May in Washington, D.C., is held in collaboration with the <a href="http://braintumor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">National Brain Tumor Society</a> to inspire and give hope to the brain tumor community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Awareness day is an awesome experience because it&rsquo;s a huge vehicle to strengthen the community. We bring together scientists, clinicians, patients, caregivers, and advocates to work together and bridge gaps,&rdquo; says Wallgren. The event epitomizes the goal of the CERN Foundation <span>community outreach programs</span> &ndash; to have a positive impact on people living with ependymoma.</p>
<p>Another community initiative to focus on patient outcomes started as the <a href="https://www.cern-foundation.org/get-involved/risk-project/outcome-project-results" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121711" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264103" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121711" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ependymoma Outcomes Project</a>, led by Terri Armstrong, deputy chief of NCI&rsquo;s CCR, Neuro-Oncology Branch. The success of the online survey led to the current <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=1121711&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121711" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7264107">Outcomes and Risk Project</a> for people with rare CNS cancers as part of NCI-CONNECT. It aims to improve the understanding of risk factors associated with rare CNS cancers, including ependymoma. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7264104" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121675">partnership with NCI-CONNECT</a> brings so much hope because it is taking research to new levels, beyond the capabilities of any one group,&rdquo; says Wallgren. &ldquo;And it is exciting that we have a voice in its patient-focused projects and research efforts. Collaboration is what will enable a vision to become a reality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Through all its activities, the CERN Foundation is making the voice of people living with ependymoma prominent and distinguishable. And the scientific and clinical communities are listening. The participation of patients and families is key to advance research.</p>

<p>A primary brain tumor is a mass of abnormal cells that arises in the brain. An estimated 24,000 adults are diagnosed each year in the United States with a <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045333&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045333&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">cancerous</a> brain tumor. And brain cancers are less than 2% of all cancers diagnosed. This makes brain cancer more challenging to treat and study than other cancers.</p>
<p>To better understand brain tumor care, treatment, impact, and research, we talked to NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research, Neuro-Oncology Branch Chief, <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/mark-r-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gilbert, M.D.</a>, and Deputy Chief, <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/terri-s-armstrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri Armstrong, Ph.D.</a></p>
<h2><strong>Q: How are brain tumors diagnosed? </strong></h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> People most often have a sudden symptom like a seizure, migraine, or cognitive issue, and go to the emergency room or doctor. There, imaging tests, such as an MRI or a CT scan, can detect a brain tumor. Then, a biopsy is performed to remove a piece of tumor tissue for examining by a <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000318818&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000318818&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">neuropathologist</a> who determines the grade, tumor type, and genetic information. This is critically important to make an <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/nci/rare-brain-spine-tumor/tumors/about-cns-tumors#diagnosis">accurate diagnosis</a>.</p>
<p>There are more than 100 different types of primary brain tumors and treatment is dependent upon the tumor type. A misdiagnosis can result in an inaccurate <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000774686&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000774686&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">treatment plan</a>. So, we strongly encourage patients to seek a second opinion to find a neuro-oncologist with experience treating their tumor type (see <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1122213" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1122213" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7317018" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1122213">Guiding Questions</a><span> to ask your doctor</span>). &nbsp;</p>
<p>A good time to get a second opinion is when the tumor is first diagnosed or if there is recurrence and patients are thinking about other treatment options. This helps patients feel comfortable about their treatment decisions. If seen at NIH, we always contact the referring doctor to let them know our thoughts and partner with them. To make an appointment or <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=14&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121717" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121717" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7317019" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121717">refer a patient</a>, contact us at <a href="mailto:NCINOBReferrals@mail.nih.gov">NCINOBReferrals@mail.nih.gov</a> or call 1-866-251-9686.</p>
<h2><strong>Q: What are brain tumor treatment options? </strong></h2>
<p><strong>A: </strong>There is no cookbook, as we say, that covers all brain tumors and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121723" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121723" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7317020" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121723">how we treat them</a>. We need very important information, starting with the tumor type and grade. And as our knowledge is expanding, we can rely on genetic changes within specific tumors to guide treatment. We also individualize treatment based on patient factors, including functional status and concurrent illness. This helps optimize the therapy for each patient.</p>
<p>That said, surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible is typically the first treatment for brain tumors. The risks and benefits of surgery depend on the location of the tumor in the brain. We encourage patients to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1122214" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1122214" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7317021" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1122214">seek a neurosurgeon</a> who is an expert in brain tumor neurosurgeries. Radiation therapy and chemotherapy are other treatments considered after surgery and can depend on the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045702&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045702&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">tumor grade</a> &ndash; grade I tumors are usually not cancer and can be treated with surgery; grade II, III and IV tumors are cancerous and either have a higher chance of coming back or are fast-growing, so often need more treatment after surgery.</p>
<h2><strong>Q: What new brain tumor treatment approaches are you studying?&nbsp; </strong></h2>
<p><strong>A: </strong>There have been tremendous advances in our ability to investigate cancers. We can do <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000386202&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000386202&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">genetic analysis</a> to better understand the biology of the cancer to start asking questions about specific treatments. We consider these treatments targeted therapies. Meaning, we can personalize treatment based on the specific characteristics of the cancer. We are discovering that many cancers, even though they fall under the same name, have individual differences we can target.</p>
<p><a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045729&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045729&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">Immunotherapy</a> is a treatment that has been a fantastic advance in other cancers. Diseases that were previously incurable, physicians are now putting patients into long-term remission with immunotherapy. And we would like to see the same type of success in brain tumors. But we also recognize that treating brain tumors is more complicated than other cancers. It will likely turn out that it won't be a single immunotherapy that works. It will have to be a combination of strategies to overcome some of the difficulties in getting an <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=2056&amp;sys_contentid=1116081" sys_dependentvariantid="2056" sys_dependentid="1116081" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7317022" sys_variantid="2056" sys_contentid="1116081">immune reaction in the brain</a>.</p>
<p>We have active <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search/v?id=NCT03173950&amp;r=1">clinical trials to better understand immunotherapy</a>, as well as other therapies. <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045961&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045961&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">Clinical trials</a> are important to advance our knowledge and help us develop better and better treatments for patients with brain tumors. We need to focus energy and participation in <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=18&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7317023" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">clinical trials</a>.</p>
<h2><strong>Q: How can brain tumors affect patients? </strong></h2>
<p><strong>A: </strong>The <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2317&amp;sys_contentid=1120689" sys_dependentvariantid="2317" sys_dependentid="1120689" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7317024" sys_variantid="2317" sys_contentid="1120689">impact of a brain tumor on patients</a> can be great. It's estimated that over 50% of low and <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000386205&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000386205&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">high-grade</a> tumor patients have difficultly even returning to work from the time of diagnosis. We know that <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=1&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120672" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120672" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7317025" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120672">symptom</a>s can occur at the time of diagnosis, but some can also occur throughout the time the person is dealing with the illness.</p>
<p>Researchers, like us, are focusing on understanding what that impact is on the patient and trying to improve it, specifically understanding the impact of our treatments. Within our clinical trials, we try to identify that and monitor patients throughout the trial. We are learning more about people living with the diagnosis of a brain tumor and the issues they face, including care issues, financial issues, and the impact on the extended family.</p>
<p>At NIH, we are focused on <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=5&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120713" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120713" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7317026" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120713">helping patients cope</a> with their illness and deal with the issues they may face as a result of it.</p>
<h2><strong>Q: What is the future of brain tumor research? </strong></h2>
<p><strong>A:</strong> There are a couple areas of investigation. We are working to understand the cell of origin of brain cancers. We don&rsquo;t understand in most patients why cancer formed because the cancers are so uncommon. We are working with our colleagues in <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000257225&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000257225&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">epidemiology</a> to understand if some patients may have a susceptibility to cancer.</p>
<p>We have also discovered that cancer cells have a unique <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046173&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046173&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">metabolism</a>. There are active studies trying to target that metabolism to specifically target the cancer without causing side effects. This is called metabolomics.</p>
<p>I'm excited about the fact that we are making progress both at the genetic level to find targeted therapies and in immunotherapy. We are using techniques and approaches to study immunotherapy that are really cutting edge that will hopefully lead to a better understanding of immunotherapy for brain tumors and translate into much better treatment.</p>
<p>There is also a level of international collaboration that is unprecedented. Everybody recognizes that there needs to be a collective effort to make advancements. And so, the scale, scope, and sophistication of our clinical trials is increasing.

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>I was 21 years old and a recent college graduate when I had my first petit mal <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045484&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045484&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">seizure</a>. My brain would take over everything in my body. It was like a movie screen turned on in the top left quarter of my vision and all my other senses turned off. I felt like I could see the future in fast forward but couldn&rsquo;t talk or move.</p>
<p>The initial petit mal seizures each lasted about 10 to 15 seconds. To others, it looked like I was staring off blankly. The unplanned seizures and headaches with auras (strange feeling, experience or movement), continued to worsen over 9 months. I was too stubborn to visit the doctor.</p>
<p>Then, I had a grand mal seizure at my parents&rsquo; home in Virginia in February 2010. When I woke up, I was fighting the emergency medical team at the house. I didn&rsquo;t want to get on a stretcher. It took a phone call my father, who was away on a business trip, to coax me to the hospital.</p>
<p>An MRI in the emergency room revealed a brain tumor. I did not hesitate to have surgery to remove it.</p>
<h2><strong>Surviving the Most Aggressive Brain Cancer</strong></h2>
<p>Two weeks after surgery, I was back to running and playing soccer. My life returned to normal. About a month later, I went in for a follow-up appointment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was told I had <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045698&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045698&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">glioblastoma</a>, the most aggressive brain cancer. I don&rsquo;t remember anything the doctor said before or after the words &ldquo;brain cancer&rdquo; or the way I reacted. But, apparently, I punched a hole in the wall.</p>
<p>I immediately started six weeks of radiation, followed by 18 months of chemotherapy. I then started a vaccine clinical trial at NIH in 2012. And for seven years, my brain cancer was monitored by NCI&rsquo;s <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuro-Oncology Branch</a> healthcare team. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a weird scenario because I was doing so well. Everyone kept telling me that it was a miracle I was alive. After years of being told I was a miracle, I just didn&rsquo;t want to hear it anymore. I was focused on living a normal and healthy life.</p>
<p>Going to NIH was an eye-opening experience. It is my second home. I &nbsp;never felt sick or like being there was real life. I was a physically-fit law officer on a fast-track to be a Secret Service special agent.</p>
<p>Then, in 2014, I was rear-ended at a red light. An MRI showed my brain bleeding in my <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046491&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046491&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">brain stem</a>. My stroke-like symptoms worsened quickly, and I needed surgery. I was now considered terminally ill and it was unrelated to my brain cancer.</p>
<h2><strong>Discovering I was Misdiagnosed &nbsp;</strong></h2>
<p>In 2015, I had surgery for my brain bleed in Arizona and rehab in Virginia. I returned to visit the neuro-oncology team at NIH for routine monitoring of my brain cancer. And I received life-altering news.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/nci/rare-brain-spine-tumor/tumors/about-cns-tumors#who-treats">neuropathologist</a> at NIH had studied my tumor tissue and discovered it was not glioblastoma. Instead, I had a low-grade, slow-growing rare brain tumor called <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=5&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120681" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120681" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7304643" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120681">Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) tumor</a>. The diagnosis explains why I was doing so well with what was supposed to be a lethal cancer.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think I would be super happy. But I didn&rsquo;t feel anything. I didn&rsquo;t cry or scream. I was blank. People had been calling me a miracle for nearly a decade of my life. I didn&rsquo;t know what to do or think.</p>
<p>The news for my parents was monumental. As my caregivers, they came with me to every appointment and procedure and provided emotional and physical support.</p>
<p>I know that I will be dealing with this brain tumor for the rest of my life. So, after the news, I decided to take my life into my own hands and start over. Now at age 31, I moved from my parents&rsquo; home to Texas to become a software engineer.</p>
<h2><strong>Adopting a Fighter Mindset and Choosing to Live</strong></h2>
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">Early on in my cancer journey, I adopted a fighter mindset. I knew I had a choice when I was diagnosed. I could choose to feel sorry for myself or I could choose to live my life.</p>
<p class="author">Darien</p>
</div>
<p>People kept telling me, &ldquo;You&rsquo;re so strong.&rdquo; But I was living the way I always lived &ndash; a fighter.</p>
<p>I also had bad days. Cancer treatment made me feel ugly. My brain bleed caused my right eye to turn in temporarily and I couldn&rsquo;t drive, run, or perform routine tasks. I now have a loss of balance, vision impairments, and partial numbness in my fingers and hands, but I don&rsquo;t feel disabled.</p>
<p>What I want to tell people is you can&rsquo;t control the rain, but you can control how you react to it. Just like cancer. It&rsquo;s not your fault, but you have power over your way of thinking. Live your life.</p>

<p>How do we make everyday life for patients with rare central nervous system (CNS) cancers better? That&rsquo;s the question that drives Senior Investigator <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/terri-s-armstrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri Armstrong, Ph.D.</a>, of NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research, Neuro-Oncology Branch. It stems from her personal experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As an undergraduate student at The Ohio State University, her mother and great grandmother were diagnosed with cancer. Dr. Armstrong chose to pursue oncology nursing. After graduating, she worked at a cancer hospital in Ohio and cared for her mother. Then, her two aunts were also diagnosed with cancer.</p>
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">I lost them all and it had a huge impact. I wanted to do more. I wanted to learn how to do a better job at taking care of the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045417&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045417&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">quality of life</a> issues that people with cancer face.</p>
<p class="author">Dr. Armstrong</p>
</div>
<p>Dr. Armstrong earned a doctorate in nursing. She has cared for brain and spine tumor patients for more than 28 years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Neuro-oncology patients have very special needs and issues above having a cancer diagnosis,&rdquo; says Dr. Armstrong, deputy chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch and co-director of NCI-CONNECT. Her research focuses on improving patient outcomes and <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000269453&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000269453&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">symptom management</a>.</p>
<p>Dr. Armstrong is developing ways to accurately measure the impact of brain and spine tumors and treatments on patients. And how to lessen the impact. She is also exploring <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046391&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046391&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">genetic</a> data to understand underlying <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=15&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2317&amp;sys_contentid=929550" sys_dependentvariantid="2317" sys_dependentid="929550" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7360778" sys_variantid="2317" sys_contentid="929550">risk factors</a> &ndash; something that increases the chance of developing cancer &ndash; and predictors of disease.</p>
<h2><strong>Studying Patient Outcomes and Risk Factors</strong></h2>
<p>In 2008, Dr. Armstrong was caring for a patient with a rare brain cancer called ependymoma. The encounter encouraged her to start a project to understand the qualify of life of people with ependymoma. &ldquo;We thought we could just look at our database of patients with ependymoma to understand the illness. But in over a decade of care, we only had about 120 patients with ependymoma. And we didn&rsquo;t have long-term follow-up,&rdquo; she explains.</p>
<p>Dr. Armstrong developed an online survey for people worldwide living with ependymoma to share their experiences. &ldquo;We learned a lot in that first year. We had 160 participants and 60 different healthcare providers. About 50% of patients were unable to return to work and 75% were on pain medications,&rdquo; she says.</p>
<p>Researchers also learned that 33% of participants were unsure of the grade of their tumor. This shows the potential lack of disease education. It also has implications in planning treatment and determining <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000774384&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000774384&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">follow-up care</a>. More, researchers discovered nearly 60% of participants with an ependymoma in their spine experience symptoms for more than a year before diagnosis, compared to less than 30% of participants with an ependymoma in their brain.</p>
<p>With this knowledge, Dr. Armstrong and <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/nci/rare-brain-spine-tumor/blog/2018/spotlight-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gilbert, M.D.,</a> chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch and co-director of NCI-CONNECT, developed the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121711" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121711" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7360779" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121711">Outcomes and Risk Project</a> and <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=19&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7360780" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">Natural History Study</a> for patients with rare CNS cancers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Outcomes and Risk Project includes an online survey and collects a saliva sample to help researchers understand the impact and risk factors associated with the disease. And both can be done at home. &ldquo;It is descriptive of the patient experience, so we can learn to better care for patients and address their needs,&rdquo; says Dr. Armstrong.</p>
<p>Notably, the <a href="https://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/article/20/suppl_6/vi217/5153731" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first published report</a> on risk factors in adults with ependymoma showed that asthma and allergy effects may be more pronounced among ependymoma cases compared to <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045700&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045700&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">gliomas</a> overall. The report used data from the Outcomes and Risk Project. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Natural History Study pairs with the outcomes study to get a complete picture of what is happening to the patient. Patients participating in the Natural History Study are evaluated at the NIH and provide a tumor tissue sample.</p>
<p>The Natural History Study is also unique because researchers follow the same person through each stage of his or her disease. &ldquo;This enables us to tell people what to expect through the course of their cancer. It can also help us anticipate, intervene and improve outcomes,&rdquo; says Dr. Armstrong.</p>
<p>A remarkable 500 people with a brain or spine tumor enrolled in the Natural History Study, including those with very rare tumors. The Neuro-Oncology Branch research team <a href="https://academic.oup.com/neuro-oncology/article/20/suppl_6/NP/5154662?searchresult=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shared over 15 abstracts</a> at the Society for Neuro-Oncology Annual Scientific Meeting in November 2018 based on study data. The abstracts included data on patient outcomes, symptom burden, electronic capture of information, and symptom tracking and reporting.</p>
<p>Dr. Armstrong is working with epidemiologists to analyze the information collected on exposures. She&rsquo;s looking for genomic changes that may be associated with the risk for developing the tumor. &nbsp;Her research also seeks to understand the person&rsquo;s experience after diagnosed. This will help providers understand the impact of the disease to better educate people on what to expect. It will also help providers develop better ways to care for both the patient and the family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More and more we are learning that brain and spine tumors are very individualized. We must understand the genetic alterations and the experience to improve patient outcomes,&rdquo; says Dr. Armstrong.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Sharing Knowledge through NCI-CONNECT</strong></h2>
<p>Dr. Armstrong aims to gather enough data to provide knowledge to people living with a rare brain or spine cancer. And to ease their stress and suffering. She also wants to reach healthcare providers with this knowledge through NCI-CONNECT.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NCI-CONNECT is putting the infrastructure in place for us to bring experts across centers and institutions studying these rare cancers together to talk and learn from each other,&rdquo; says Dr. Armstrong. To this end, NCI-CONNECT is hosting tumor-specific workshops at NIH each year.</p>
<p>More, in January 2019, <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/nci/rare-brain-spine-tumor/refer-participate/referrals/clinic">NCI-CONNECT Clinic</a> launched to bring together adult patients with the same rare brain or spine tumor and their caregivers to receive special services. Providers are encouraged to partner with the NCI-CONNECT clinical care team by <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=23&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121717" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121717" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7360781" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121717">referring patients</a>. The clinical care team will evaluate patients for studies and collaborate with providers on treatment and care plans.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our partnership with providers will allow us to share our knowledge about the issues that patients face, thereby improving care for those individual patients and patients yet to be diagnosed with these tumors,&rdquo; says Dr. Armstrong.</p>

<p>The Fourth Biennial Ependymoma Consensus was held at NIH, February 20 to 22, 2019. Neuro-oncology experts worldwide met to advance their knowledge and collaborate to find better treatments for people with <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=11&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7282976" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120675">ependymoma</a>.</p>
<p>The consensus was co-led by <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Laboratory-of-Pathology/kenneth-aldape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenneth Aldape, M.D.</a>, chief of NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research (CCR), Laboratory of Pathology, and <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/mark-r-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gilbert, M.D.</a>, chief, and <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/terri-s-armstrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri Armstrong, Ph.D.</a>, deputy chief, both of NCI&rsquo;s CCR, Neuro-Oncology Branch, at NIH. Participants included basic scientists and researchers, clinical scientists and researchers, neuro-oncologists, and advocacy partners.</p>
<p>In its history, the Ependymoma Consensus has helped define areas of research for ependymoma and advance therapies for patients. Importantly, the consensus is an international collaboration. Participants recognize the complexity of ependymoma &ndash; a rare brain and spine cancer &ndash; and the need to work together to understand tumor <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000444994&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000444994&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">genetics</a> and molecular characteristics to advance treatments.</p>
<p>During the 2019 consensus, participants presented the latest research and advances in the field. Then, they gathered in three working groups to discuss preclinical models, the pathology and molecular classification of tumors, and to discuss clinical trial designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was exciting to bring world leaders in the field of ependymoma together to highlight the pressing problems and develop strategies to collectively and effectively address these problems in ways that can lead to improved patient outcomes,&rdquo; says Dr. Aldape.</p>
<p>Participants also discussed a global effort to sort the various subtypes of ependymoma, and how to define and treat the various subtypes, and the state of <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046128&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046128&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">genetic testing</a>. &ldquo;We are gaining new insight into ependymoma subtypes, which we believe will improve our ability to treat ependymoma and provide valuable and meaningful care to patients,&rdquo; says Dr. Armstrong.</p>

They brought the patient perspective to help researchers and clinicians understand how to communicate their efforts to patients and their families.</p>
<p>Recognizing the challenges in rare cancer studies, the attendees discussed the design of novel clinical trials, which are critical to developing new therapies. &ldquo;Additionally, researchers and clinicians highlighted the importance of molecular and genetic testing to design targeted trials and the need to develop trials for patients whose tumor has recurred after the initial treatment,&rdquo; says Dr. Gilbert.&nbsp; Inclusion of clinical outcomes assessment, or how the treatments impact the person, were also discussed as integral to trial designs.</p>
<p>The Fourth Biennial Ependymoma Consensus was successful to bring together motivated and knowledgeable experts. It determined areas of research for ependymoma to make progress in patient outcomes with an understanding of the complexity of the disease. With these goals and strategies, participants will collaborate to more effectively address these issues.</p>

<p>The National Brain Tumor Society (<a href="http://braintumor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NBTS</a>) has a history of collaboration and dedication in driving brain tumor research and treatments while helping patients. For nearly 30 years, it has empowered patients and families to take a more active role in their brain tumor care and funded critical research projects. It has also granted and awarded funds to brain tumor researchers all over the world to help new discoveries in hopes to find a cure for brain tumors.</p>
<p>NBTS officially formed in 2008 when two non-profits merged &ndash; the National Brain Tumor Foundation (NBTF) and the Brain Tumor Society&nbsp;(BTS). NBTF was founded in 1981 and had established programs and comprehensive resources and support services for the brain tumor community. BTS was founded in 1989 and was making grants for brain tumor research that were leading to breakthroughs in patient treatments.</p>
<p>Each of these foundations were started by people who were deeply affected by a brain tumor. By merging, they created one powerful and passionate voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is our plan to unite and mobilize the brain tumor community in new, creative ways that can change policies and innovate current standards of care, resources, and knowledge while ensuring that no one is alone when facing a brain tumor diagnosis,&rdquo; says David Arons, Chief Executive Officer of NBTS.</p>
<p>Arons joined NBTS in 2011 because of his personal experience. &ldquo;I sought the opportunity to try and defeat cancer for taking my father&rsquo;s life,&rdquo; he says. He is inspired by the patients, families, volunteers, clinicians, researchers, and all those who choose to work to find a cure for brain tumors.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Through innovative research, we have the opportunity to realize transformative medicines that could dramatically extend survival and quality of life for brain tumor patients,&rdquo; Arons says.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Expansive Resources for Patients and Families </strong></h2>
<p>NBTS offers a variety of resources and information for people at all stages of a brain tumor diagnosis. These resources are available <a href="http://braintumor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">online</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;by phone at (617) 924-9997 or info@braintumor.org. The resources generally <a href="http://braintumor.org/brain-tumor-information/resources-for-patient-and-caregiver-assistance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">include</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Key questions for patients to ask their doctors at <a href="http://braintumor.org/brain-tumor-information/theexperience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">braintumor.org/theexperience</a>.</li>
<li>Information about types of treatment and clinical trials at all stages.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Progress and results concerning cutting-edge research.</li>
<li>Guidance and options for making the most-informed next step decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>NBTS also offers &ldquo;concierge&rdquo; support over the phone to help people find information. NBTS also has a tool on its website called the <a href="https://trials.braintumor.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Clinical Trials Finder</a>. It helps patients and care partners find brain tumor-centric clinical trials in their region or around the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We offer informational support to help patients and families feel empowered when navigating their diagnosis, treatment, and beyond,&rdquo; Arons says.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Another unique NBTS website feature is <a href="http://braintumor.org/brain-tumor-information/theexperience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Brain Tumor Experience</a>. It takes visitors through the stages of living with a brain tumor. From symptoms and diagnosis through treatments and survival. Patients and families can find information and guidance about all the stages of their brain tumor experience. Included in the experience are important questions to ask your doctor at each stage provided in a form that can be easily printed and used for note-taking at appointments. Webinars and videos offer helpful treatment information for patients for easy viewing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>NBTS also has a blog and webpage called <a href="http://braintumor.org/our-research/whats-new-in-brain-tumor-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">What&rsquo;s New in Brain Tumor Progress</a> to regularly provide the latest research and other pertinent updates to the brain tumor community. Another <a href="http://braintumor.org/your-voice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">area of the website </a>includes ways for people to participate with NBTS or help educate the community.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We encourage people to engage with us in many ways. Volunteers can become an advocate or participate in community events, which are great ways for people to connect with each other,&rdquo; Arons says.</p>
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">We all know dealing with a brain tumor can be devastating and isolating, so ultimately through all our work, we seek to provide hope, connection, and support to patients and their families.</p>

<h2><strong>Collaboration to Expand Resources for Rare Brain Tumors &nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>To expand resources, NBTS is partnering with NCI-CONNECT. &ldquo;Brain tumor patients are an underserved population, so those with the rarest tumors have an even greater challenge,&rdquo; Arons says.</p>
<p>These rare tumor populations are ultra-small. NCI is filling a key void by putting a spotlight on these diseases and helping bring together the brain tumor community to help.</p>
<p>NCI-CONNECT <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7305829" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121675">aims to partner</a> with non-profit organizations like NBTS who share a common concern for improving the outcomes of patients with rare adult <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046481&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046481&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">central nervous system</a> (CNS) tumors through awareness and education.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NCI-CONNECT represents an innovative opportunity to increase resources to advance research related to rare CNS tumors,&rdquo; Arons says. &ldquo;I hope our partnership with NCI-CONNECT and other brain tumor organizations, across all tumor types, reaches its goal to develop new approaches to treatment in the next five years.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Treating people with rare <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046481&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046481&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">central nervous system</a> (CNS) tumors takes an army &ndash; literally. <a href="https://www.wrnmmc.capmed.mil/SitePages/home.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Walter Reed National Military Medical Center</a> neuro-oncologist Brett Theeler, M.D., has partnered with NCI&rsquo;s neuro-oncology team to treat patients.</p>
<p>Dr. Theeler is a Lieutenant Colonel in the United States Army. He joined Walter Reed in Bethesda, Maryland, in 2012, after finishing his neuro-oncology fellowship at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston where he trained under <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/mark-r-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gilbert, M.D.</a>, chief of NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research, Neuro-Oncology Branch. Dr. Theeler joined the <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Neuro-Oncology Branch</a> as a clinical collaborator in 2015.</p>
<p>At Walter Reed Bethesda, Dr. Theeler treats active duty service-members and their family members, military retirees and veterans with brain or spine cancers.</p>
<div class="pullquote">
<p class="pullquote-text">Neuro-oncology clinical care at NIH is team-oriented and multidisciplinary. Working with the Neuro-Oncology Branch has improved the care I am able to provide for patients at Walter Reed Bethesda.</p>
<p class="author">Dr. Brett Theeler</p>
</div>
<p>He also participates in the development of clinical trials, educational activities, and workshops for rare CNS tumors as part of NCI-CONNECT.</p>
<p>To this end, Dr. Theeler is treating and learning about patients with one of the rarest of rare CNS cancers called <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=10&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120681" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120681" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7360784" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120681">Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (PXA) and Anaplastic Pleomorphic Xanthoastrocytoma (APXA)</a>. There are fewer than 100 people diagnosed per year in the United States with a PXA or APXA and there is an estimated 1,081 people living with PXA and APXA in the United States.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The biggest challenge is there is no <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000346525&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000346525&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">standard of care</a> for these tumors after surgery. Whether radiation therapy after surgery is needed and improves outcomes is unproven.&nbsp; There are no proven chemotherapy options for patients who recur after <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046565&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046565&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">surgical resection</a>,&rdquo; Dr. Theeler says. &ldquo;Conducting a clinical trial specific for PXA patients would be extremely difficult due to the rarity of these cancers.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>Overcoming PXA and APXA Research Challenges </strong></h2>
<p>In addition to PXA and APXA being extremely rare tumors, they present for clinical care in different ways. Some patients experience seizures and sometimes present with drug-resistant epilepsy. Motor, speech or cognitive impairments may lead to neuroimaging and a brain tumor being discovered. Patients may have their brain tumors found when brain MRIs are done for common conditions, especially headaches, which may lead to PXAs being found incidentally.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most patients come to us either having surgery or radiation or both, and we emphasize the need for expert pathology review of the tumor tissue,&rdquo; Dr. Theeler says. &ldquo;The analysis can ensure an accurate diagnosis and help us determine the best treatment approach.&rdquo;</p>
<p>PXAs or APXAs can mimic other primary brain tumors microscopically, and can even be mistaken for aggressive brain cancers, particularly glioblastoma. Neuropathology review and advanced tumor profiling, such as <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000655031&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000655031&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">methylation</a> profiling, may be needed to accurately diagnose PXAs in some cases. NCI&rsquo;s molecular neuropathologist <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Laboratory-of-Pathology/kenneth-aldape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kenneth Aldape, M.D.</a>, is leading the review all CNS tumor tissue for NCI-CONNECT.</p>
<p>Studying PXA and APXA tumor tissue is the first step to better understanding these tumors. Sixty percent of PXA and APXA tumors have a specific <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046063&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046063&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">mutation</a> in the <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000561325&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000561325&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">BRAF gene</a>, the BRAF V600E mutation. This type of BRAF mutation has been found in other types of cancer including melanoma and lung cancer. Targeted agents that block the BRAF protein are approved for use in patients with metastatic melanoma and other non-CNS cancers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>PXAs, APXAs, and other brain tumors with BRAF V600E mutations have been treated by a type of trial called a basket trial with BRAF blocking drugs, vemurafenib and dabrafenib. &ldquo;Basket trials enroll patients with different types of cancer, no matter where the cancer is in the body, if the cancers all share the same oncogene mutations,&rdquo; Dr. Theeler explains. &ldquo;Basket trials enable patients with rare cancers to participate in clinical trials and researchers to study drugs to treat the rare tumors.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Study results from a basket trial using vemurafenib showed three of&nbsp;six&nbsp;patients with PXAs had a tumor response. The results were published in the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30351999" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Journal of Clinical Oncology</a>. Dr. Theeler is working with NCI-CONNECT to develop more basket trials using the next generation of targeted therapies for rare CNS cancers, including PXA.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Educating Patients to Participate in Clinical Studies </strong></h2>
<p>Dr. Theeler believes that every patient that has a rare CNS cancer should consider visiting the Neuro-Oncology Branch or another comprehensive neuro-oncology program with experience treating patients with rare cancers at least once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are collecting patient information and tumor tissue as part of our <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=19&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7360785" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">natural history study</a> to increase our knowledge and build a community of patients with rare CNS cancers through NCI-CONNECT,&rdquo; Dr. Theeler says. &ldquo;We hope to recruit enough patients so that we can have clinics dedicated to patients with PXA and APXA.&rdquo;</p>
<p>During an <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=1147238&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1147238" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7360796">NCI-CONNECT Clinic</a>, patients meet other patients with their same diagnosis and meet a multidisciplinary team that has experience treating rare tumors. &ldquo;We understand a rare cancer diagnosis can be very isolating. While I can&rsquo;t say I have walked in their shoes, I can tell patients we have seen others with their type of cancer. I hope that can give them peace of mind when we provide treatment advice,&rdquo; Dr. Theeler says.</p>
<p>He is grateful for the opportunity to collaborate with other neuro-oncologists and researchers in NCI's Neuro-Oncology Branch in caring for patients with rare cancers and in the development of clinical trials for these patients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The meeting began with a tumor board led by NCI Neuro-oncologist <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/marta-penas-prado" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Marta Penas-Prado, M.D.</a>; Nurse Practitioner Christine Siegel; Genetic Counselor Margarita Raygada, Ph.D.; and Nurse Practitioner Lisa Boris. <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=9&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1127193" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1127193" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7361395" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1127193">The team</a> presented two cases to be reviewed and discussed by a panel of neuro-oncology specialist: Neuropathologist Kenneth Aldape, M.D.; Neurosurgeon Kareem Zaghloul, M.D.; Neuroradiologist Jim Smirniotopoulos, M.D.; and Radiation Oncologist Christine Tsien, M.D.</p>
<p>The first case was an anaplastic ependymoma. The second case was a patient with gliomatosis cerebri<span>, </span>a tumor that is challenging because the diagnosis is based on both pathology and imaging. Based on the information presented and thoughtful discussions, the tumor board panel provided treatment and management guidance.</p>
<h3><strong>Overview and Progress</strong></h3>
<p>After the tumor board, NCI-CONNECT Co-directors <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/mark-r-gilbert" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mark Gilbert, M.D.</a>, and <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/terri-s-armstrong" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Terri Armstrong, Ph.D.</a>, welcomed meeting attendees. Dr. Gilbert is also the principal investigator for the BTTC and chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch. Dr. Armstrong is the deputy chief of the Neuro-Oncology Branch and co-leader of the BTTC.</p>
<p>Drs. Gilbert and Armstrong shared an overview of the NCI-CONNECT program and ways meeting participants can get involved to help the program reach its goals. To this end, investigators are collecting and analyzing patient-reported outcome and risk exposure, clinical and treatment history data and biological specimens in clinical studies to enable a better understanding of rare CNS tumors. They intend to create a database, so all researchers have access to the data to develop future studies. Patients who visit NIH are also screened for open <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=19&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121709" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121709" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7361396" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121709">clinical trials</a> and provided treatment advice. Patients are able to <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=24&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121717" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121717" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7361397" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121717">visit NIH</a> free-of-charge so that much of the costs in seeking a consultation are eliminated.&nbsp;</p>

</ul>
<p>Then, NCI Associate Research Physician Dr. Penas-Prado presented the newly launched NCI-CONNECT Clinics to improve the care of patients with rare CNS tumors. She shared the special services patients receive and ways the NCI-CONNECT network providers can <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=24&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121717" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121717" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7361402" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121717">refer patients</a>. NCI providers want to work together with referring providers to ensure patients get the best treatment possible.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Tissue Studies </strong></h3>
<p>The next meeting presentation and discussion focused on tumor tissue studies with <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Laboratory-of-Pathology/kenneth-aldape" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Aldape</a>, chief of NCI&rsquo;s Laboratory of Pathology, and Dr. Penas-Prado. With roughly 12% of brain tumor patients misdiagnosed, Dr. Aldape discussed challenges and difficulty neuropathologists face classifying rare tumors. To provide an accurate diagnosis, Dr. Aldape performs an integrative analysis and uses methylation profiling. Patients who come to the NCI-CONNECT Clinic will have their tumor tissue analyzed to confirm their diagnosis.</p>

<p></p>
<p>To learn more about these tumors, Dr. Penas-Prado shared plans to collect clinical data and tumor tissue samples to create a tissue repository of rare CNS tumors to develop better treatments. The repository will allow researchers to study the clinical course of adult patients with rare tumors and help them predict effective drug therapies and outcomes. It will also enable researchers to more accurately classify CNS tumor types and predict which drugs, and combination of drugs, will respond. Included in the tissue repository will be samples from pregnant women with brain tumors. The <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044956&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000044956&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">retrospective study</a> of pregnant women will study potential risks and changes in tumor biology that will help brain tumor patients make a more informed decision about pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>
<h3><span><strong>Multicenter Trials</strong></span></h3>
<p><span>NCI&rsquo;s CCR Deputy Clinical Director Caryn Steakley shared a regulatory update on the BTTC multicenter trials in the </span><a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/nci-role/intramural" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">NCI Intramural Research Program</a><span>. The CCR </span>serves as the lead institution and coordinating center for the BTTC. It is developing a new study database, site payment process, and a process for using a single <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000044679&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000044679&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">institutional review board</a> for multicenter <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000774488&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000774488&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">clinical research</a> studies.</p>
<p><span>Michael Pollack, Ph.D., supervisory technology transfer manager at NCI, oversees the NCI-CONNECT and BTTC site agreements. Dr. Pollack is establishing agreements with the NCI-CONNECT network to provide clinical research studies to patients with rare CNS tumors. This will allow </span>patients to access cutting-edge therapies at a center closer to their home.</p>
<h3><strong>Current Studies </strong>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>NCI-CONNECT has a number of treatment and <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000430407&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000430407&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">assessment</a> studies that are open for adult patients with rare CNS cancers. Dr. Armstrong gave an overview of the Outcomes and Risk Study that patients can participate in from home by completing an online survey and submitting a saliva sample to be used for <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046128&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046128&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">genetic testing</a>. This will help improve the understanding of outcomes and <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045873&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045873&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">risk factors</a> associated with the occurrence of rare CNS tumors. Second, she talked about the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/NCT02851706">Natural History Study</a>, which has enrolled more than 500 patients. The study collects patients&rsquo; biospecimens and information to improve the understanding of the disease over the full course of illness. Preliminary results showed over 50% of patients who have participated stated they have symptom and emotional impacts from their brain or spine tumor. There was interest throughout the BTTC sites to collect these data electronically at their centers.</p>
<p>Advocacy <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=7&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121675" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121675" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7361403" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121675">partners</a>, including the ABTA, CERN Foundation, EndBrainCancer Initiative, IBTA and Oligo Nation, and collaborators, the Biden Cancer Initiative and Loglio, were an integral part to the conversation. They brought the patient perspective to help researchers and clinicians understand how to communicate their efforts to patients and their families.</p>

<p>Dr. Gilbert shared details on open clinical trials at NCI for patients with rare CNS tumors. This included a <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/NCT03173950">clinical trial</a> investigating an immunotherapy drug called nivolumab for 9 rare CNS cancers.&nbsp;Plans are underway to launch this as the first NCI-CONNECT multi-center trial across the research network in fall 2019.</p>
<p>Another open NCI-CONNECT <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/NCI-2018-03715">clinical trial</a> is investigating the drug sunitinib as a potential treatment for people with either a gliosarcoma or primary brain sarcoma. A gliosarcoma is a subtype of glioblastoma and is a very aggressive tumor. Dr. Gilbert also shared a newly opened <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/NCI-2018-02730">clinical trial</a> that is investigating the drug marizomib as a potential treatment for people with recurrent ependymoma. This trial will target pathways for treatment evaluating fairly aggressive RELA-fusion supratentorial ependymomas and if responses are seen, the study will be extended to include non RELA-fusion.</p>
<p><a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/Neuro-Oncology-Branch/jing-wu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jing Wu, M.D.</a>, investigator in the Neuro-Oncology Branch at NCI, presented and explained how there is no effective treatment for patients with hypermutated phenotype (HMP) tumors.

Nearly 40% of patients had stable disease at one year, with improvement in disease-related symptoms. Results from the study were so impressive the treatment is is now part of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for adults with recurrent ependymoma.&nbsp;Plans are to conduct a confirmatory trial with the hope that confirmed results will result in regulatory approval. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Neuro-oncology investigators proposed new trial ideas for attendees to review and discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>A First in Human Phase 1 Single Agent Open Label Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Study with Weekly Dosing of Oral ONC206 in Patients with Recurrent and Rare Primary CNS Neoplasms
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Presented by Jinkyu Jung, Ph.D., Neuro-Oncology Branch, CCR, NCI</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Attendees showed enthusiasm for moving forward on the new proposed clinical trial ideas. &nbsp;</p>
<h3><strong>Wrap-up</strong></h3>
<p>The NCI-CONNECT meeting concluded with a summary of the day and plans to further integrate the network investigators into the NCI-CONNECT program. The collaboration will allow NCI-CONNECT to reach more people with rare brain and spine tumors and improve care for patients.</p>
<h2><strong>Day 2: BTTC</strong></h2>
<p>The overall aim of the BTTC Annual Meeting was to discuss clinical trials for patients with malignant gliomas. Matt Anthony, Founder and Chairman of <a href="https://www.headforthecure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Head for the Cure</a> (HFTC), kicked off the meeting with a moving presentation of the foundation&rsquo;s accomplishments over the past year. He highlighted the HFTC Keeping the Faith program, which recognizes extraordinary patients and survivors at HFTC events. He also shared inspiring messages from the brain tumor community. Attendees were encouraged and motivated by HFTC&rsquo;s community impact.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>Dr. Gilbert welcomed attendees and gave an update on the open study for patients with imaging studies that show a likely glioblastoma. This clinical trial combines an <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000772606&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English">immune checkpoint inhibitor</a> (pembrolizumab) plus an individualize tumor specific vaccine made from the heat shock protein (HSPPC) plus standard radiation and temozolomide chemotherapy. &nbsp;The trial evaluates if the combination of HSPPC-96 vaccine made from the patient&rsquo;s own tumor and pembrolizumab is more effective treatment than pembrolizumab. The combination of HSPCC-96 and pembrolizumab may synergistically result in an increase in tumor-specific immune response. This trial originally launched at NCI and is opening at 14 additional participating BTTC centers throughout the United States.</p>
<h3><strong>New Trial Ideas</strong></h3>
<p>A breakout session for BTTC investigators followed. Investigators discussed the following protocol concept ideas:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><span> </span><span>Phase I/II Study of Temozolomide + Eflornithine (DFMO) Versus Temozolomide Alone for Newly Diagnosed IDH Mutant Gliomas </span>
<ul>
<li>Howard Colman, M.D., Huntsman Cancer Institute</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span> </span><span>Pharmacodynamic Study of Larotrectinib in Surgically Accessible Recurrent Glioma Patients with NTRK Gene Fusions </span>
<ul>
<li>Jacob Mandel, M.D., Baylor College of Medicine</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><span> </span><span>Phase II Trial of Checkpoint Inhibitor Therapy with or without BRAF/MEK Inhibitors in Newly Diagnosed or Recurrent Craniopharyngioma </span>
<ul>
<li>Carlos Kamiya-Matsuoka, M.D., The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/neuro-oncology-branch/bttc/doctors-institutions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">33 BTTC investigators</a> in attendance discussed the trial concepts and showed enthusiasm for moving forward on the proposed trial concepts. The plan is to continue discussions on these proposals with the expectation that several will be fully developed into BTTC clinical trials.&nbsp; More information will be shared as those trial concepts progress.</p>

<p>BTTC coordinating center team members at NCI led a session for research staff to learn more about clinical care for the multi-center clinical trials. Dr. Armstrong welcomed and thanked the research staff for their hard work.&nbsp;NCI Research Nurse Lisa Chamberlain gave an overview of the NCI-CONNECT program and BTTC network and the roles of the coordinating center staff.&nbsp;NCI Nurse Practitioners Christine Seigel and Lisa Boris shared information about brain tumors, current treatments, and available clinical trials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next, a panel discussion was held. It included Chamberlain; Research Associate Alvina Acquaye of NCI; Seigel; Research Nurses Sonja Crandon of NCI and Patricia Lada of NorthShore University HealthSystem; and Protocol Coordinator Jennifer Reyes of NCI. The panelists asked the participants questions on multiple topics including clinical care, regulatory activities, operations, and patient-reported outcomes. Their questions prompted lively and informative discussions.</p>
<h3><strong>Patient-reported Outcomes and Virtual Reality </strong></h3>
<p>After the breakout sessions, Dr. Armstrong presented results from her patient-reported outcomes surveys on how brain and spine tumors affect patients.&nbsp; Of patients surveyed, 40% reported at least three symptoms as moderate to severe. Distress is one of the most severe symptoms and other common symptoms are fatigue, drowsiness, difficulty remembering, and disturbed sleep. 20% of patients have significant anxiety or depression. &nbsp;</p>
<p>NCI is developing interventions to help treat these issues. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Developing an app for patients to monitor their symptoms and send reports to their physician.</li>
<li>Empowering the patient to manage their care and live meaningfully through the CALM program.</li>
<li>Using virtual reality (VR) to manage anxiety and distress.</li>
</ul>
<p>A special presentation from appliedVR&copy;, Joe Powers, Ph.D., and Jeannette Tsuei, shared the value of using VR to manage and lessen depressive symptoms. Tsuei shared studies that have shown effective results and the application that the company uses. During the break, attendees were given the opportunity to test the VR application. Attendees enjoyed the opportunity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Plans are to study these interventions throughout the BTTC network in the future.</p>
<h3><strong>New Targeted Therapy Approach and Clinical Trial</strong></h3>
<p>Dr. Gilbert presented the challenges to successful targeted therapeutic approaches to treating brain tumors. The challenge for most primary brain tumors is that there is not a clear molecular or gene target. Dr. Gilbert proposed a new targeted approach called <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000462950&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000462950&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">synthetic</a> lethality. Synthetic lethality is when a combination of deficiencies in the expression of two or more genes leads to cell death, whereas a deficiency in only one of these genes does not. Therefore, the discovery of a synthetic lethal pair where one of the two genes is already lost means that targeting the other should be lethal to the tumor cell. Orieta Celiku, Ph.D., Staff Scientist at NCI, presented the concept of synthetic rescue interactions, where the same system to detect synthetic lethality identification can be used to predict resistance mediators in patients with primary brain tumors. Dr. Gilbert proposed developing synthetic lethality for a clinical trial.</p>

<p></p>
<p>In summary, synthetic lethality can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Predict drug response and resistance based on the molecular profile of the tumor pre-treatment.</li>
<li>Predict selective therapies that exploit tumor vulnerabilities based on whole genome context.</li>
<li>Increase coverage of patient cohorts eligible for targeted and combination therapies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Wu shared information about an open <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/NCI-2018-03365">phase I trial</a> of TG02 plus dose-dense or metronomic temozolomide in high grade astrocytoma and glioblastoma. Plans are to finish the phase I trial and later open the phase II trial through the BTTC network to determine whether the combination of TG02 and temozolomide prolongs survival and improves patients&rsquo; quality of life.</p>
<h3><strong>Wrap-up </strong></h3>
<p>In conclusion, the NCI-CONNECT and BTTC Annual Meetings were a great success. Attendees learned from other neuro-oncology experts and advocates, participated in invigorating discussions on current disease treatments and advances in the pipeline, reviewed proposed clinical trials and discussed new clinical trial ideas and concepts. All attendees were gathered for the same ultimate goal: improve therapies and outcomes for adult patients with brain and spine tumors.&nbsp;</p>

    <body><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>I am a meningioma survivor. I am also a breast cancer survivor. I am a wife and mother. I know I am a blessed soul. I am sharing my story to shed light on what it feels like to live with a rare cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>I was born in Mississippi. I earned a master of science in accounting and business information systems from Mississippi State University. I worked for the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation for 12 years. There, I met my husband. When he joined the United States Army, we started our military career.</p>
<p>My first <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=5&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121295" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121295" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7368780" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121295">brain tumor symptoms</a> were in April 2001. I was 36 years old and had a two-year-old son. We were stationed in New York with my husband. While sitting at my computer that morning, I had a slight headache behind my right eye. It got worse as the day went on. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Since I had not eaten all day, we went out for dinner. I started feeling sick before I finished the meal. I wanted to go home. As soon as we got on the highway, we had to pull over. Vomit was shooting out of me. My vision in my right eye was blurry and the right side of my body was uncontrollably shaking. The projectile vomiting continued every mile or so until we reached the emergency room.</p>
<p>At this point, my head was pounding and all I could do was close my eyes and pray. Doctors started an IV with pain medication and sent me to radiation. The computed tomography (CT) scan showed a calcified cranial lesion. The doctors scheduled an MRI at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland. The MRI results revealed a left intraventricular mass.</p>
<p>The mass was small and there was not an immediate concern. The plan was to watch it with imaging every six months. After three years, all scans looked good and there was no growth. My doctor in Louisiana felt that there was no need to continue regular MRIs. I was told 90% of these slow growing tumors are <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045614&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045614&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">benign</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Discovering My Meningioma Diagnosis</strong></h2>
<p>For Christmas 2016, we visited family in Mississippi. I started the day with a headache and it persisted for the duration of our trip. We were stationed in Virginia. I made a neurology appointment with Walter Reed Bethesda.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I learned my lesion had doubled in size. I was diagnosed with a grade III anaplastic <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=4&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1120678" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1120678" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7368776" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1120678">meningioma</a>. The doctors didn&rsquo;t know why my lesion kicked into overdrive but, there it was. Even though I knew my brain cancer had to be taken care of, I waited until after my son&rsquo;s high school graduation in May 2017. Then, I waited until my husband&rsquo;s retirement from the army in February 2018. I was in denial about my diagnosis.</p>
<p>Finally, I put on my big girl pants. I left the retirement ceremony and checked into Walter Reed Bethesda. A couple of hours later, I was in surgery. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I had no complications after the surgery and discharge was smooth. The next morning, I woke up and cooked my own breakfast. A speech therapist and an exercise therapist came to my home to continue my therapy. I repeated myself a lot and people had to repeat things to me. It took a couple of weeks working on the memory deficits and math issues, but my vocabulary came back. Sometimes my recollection is delayed, but it comes. Three months after surgery, I received six weeks of radiation treatment and had hair loss around my surgical scar. Now, I am doing well and have regular MRIs. &nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>Helping Others Cope with a Rare Diagnosis</strong></h2>
<p>My neuro-oncologist at Walter Reed Bethesda, <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=2056&amp;sys_contentid=1143324" sys_dependentvariantid="2056" sys_dependentid="1143324" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_relationshipid="7368777" sys_variantid="2056" sys_contentid="1143324">Brett Theeler, M.D.</a>, informed me of an <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1121711" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1121711" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="7368778" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1121711">outcomes and risk study</a> as part of NCI-CONNECT, which aims to better understand rare brain and spine tumors.</p>

<p>Expressing my thoughts verbally is not an easy task anymore. Just completing this 600-word paper took 10 times longer than it should. Thinking and typing takes time. My solution to this inconvenience is to take breaks and rest my brain. Closing my eyes slows my brain down enough to catch up with my thoughts and words.</p>
<p>I have also made it a point to exercise five days a week. My regular exercise includes walking, tai chi or strength training with weights and always with music. I still have my faith. I survived an Achilles tendon infection that had doctors contemplating amputation. This brain cancer shall too pass.</p>
<p>Our son is now age 20 and a senior at the University of North Carolina. My husband retired after 29 years in the army and we moved into our dream home in North Carolina. I smile every day because life is good. I smile every day thinking about my family and what I have overcome and continue to overcome.</p>

<p>In May, for Brain Tumor Awareness Month (BTAM), let&rsquo;s bring the brain tumor community together to raise awareness and educate people living with a brain tumor. Our voices together can improve care.</p>
<p>Primary central nervous system (CNS) tumors begin in the brain or spinal cord. About <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/statfacts/html/brain.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">24,000 people are diagnosed</a> a year with a primary CNS cancer. All primary CNS cancers are rare, so often disease information, support, and expert care is hard to find.</p>
<p>You are encouraged to get involved by sharing information about brain tumors with others beginning in May and continue after BTAM. By raising awareness, our hope is to recognize the need for clinical studies to improve early diagnosis, standardize treatment, and improve the health of those living with this disease.</p>

<h2><strong>#BrainTumorTips</strong>&nbsp;</h2>
<p>To bring together the brain tumor community and help encourage those living with a brain tumor, we created brain tumor tips to share with our followers and are asking them to share their tips as well. We encourage you to do the same.</p>
<p>Some topic ideas for brain tumor tips include: coping with a brain tumor (feelings, adjusting, day-to-day life, self-image and sexuality, support for caregivers, survivorship, managing care); brain tumor treatments (types, trials, drugs, research); and understanding diagnosis (tumor types, symptoms). Brain tumor tips can be as videos, graphics, or any sharable message format for the community. Messages can be from a provider, researcher, patient, caregiver, advocate, or anyone affected by a brain tumor.</p>

<p>The diagnosis of a rare brain or spine tumor can be overwhelming. Patients not only worry about their own health, but the health of their family. Most cancer patients fear their cancer is hereditary or could be passed to their family.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While very few central nervous system cancers are hereditary, all are caused by genetic changes,&rdquo; says Margarita Raygada, Ph.D., oncology <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000794108&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000794108&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">genetic counselor</a> and geneticist at NCI. She helps patients understand what <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046128&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046128&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">genetic testing</a> means for their care and family cancer risk and what it means for research. Studying changes in cancer genes helps researchers develop treatments and improve care.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The importance of <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=25&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=690&amp;sys_contentid=550781" sys_dependentvariantid="690" sys_dependentid="550781" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7363603" sys_variantid="690" sys_contentid="550781">genetic testing</a> and hereditary syndromes is mostly overlooked in neuro-oncology clinics because patients have more concerning issues,&rdquo; Dr. Raygada says. NCI-CONNECT offers patients with rare brain and spine tumors a comprehensive <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/nci/rare-brain-spine-tumor/refer-participate/referrals/clinic#ui-id-3">genetic counseling evaluation</a> that includes genetic testing free-of-charge.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My intervention is medical and <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000648685&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000648685&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">psychosocial</a>. I am taking genetic test results paired with my evaluations and educating patients,&rdquo; Dr. Raygada says. She received a doctorate in medical science and molecular biology at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Maryland, a master&rsquo;s in human genetics and genetic counseling at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital (GUH) in Washington, D.C., and held two post-doctoral fellowships in molecular biology at The Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore and cancer genetics at GUH. She joined NIH in 2000 and NCI in 2017. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have always been fascinated by the way genes affect health,&rdquo; Dr. Raygada says. When she meets patients, she discusses their personal and family medical history and a management plan for cancer screenings, prevention and risk-reduction. &ldquo;It is very rewarding to be able to help patients be proactive and feel better about their care.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><strong>What to Know About Genetic Testing</strong></h2>
<p>Genetic testing is a type of medical test that identifies changes in chromosomes, genes, or proteins. There are many different types of genetic tests that are used for various reasons. Meeting with a genetic counselor helps patients understand what test is right or beneficial for them and the implications of the results.</p>
<p>Patients with rare brain or spine tumors and their family meet Dr. Raygada in the <a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=2&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1147238" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1147238" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="7363604" sys_variantid="2297" sys_contentid="1147238">NCI-CONNECT Clinic</a>. She asks the patient about their personal and family medical history and reviews medical records. She then discusses genetic testing options, including: &nbsp;</p>

<li>Diagnostic testing to confirm rare tumor type and possible tumor subtypes.</li>
<li>Predictive or pre-symptomatic genetic testing for when certain types of cancer run in a family and a gene <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046063&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046063&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">mutation</a> is suspected.</li>
<li>Carrier <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000046171&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000046171&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">screening</a> to determine if an individual is a carrier for certain genetic diseases.</li>
<li>Pharmacogenomic testing to understand how the body metabolizes medications.</li>
<li>Research testing to comprehensively profile tumors and look for new treatment targets.</li>
</ul>
<p>Genetic testing requires patients provide a saliva or blood sample. Diagnostic testing and research testing also require tumor tissue. This allows researchers to genetically profile the tumor.</p>
<p>Patients receive their genetic testing results if a mutation is discovered that changes their treatment plan or could be hereditary. This is considered a positive result. Results of genetic testing may help patients make decisions about their treatment and understand their risk for other cancers. Genetic testing also provides an opportunity for family members to learn about their own cancer risks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Genetic testing results can have many implications, especially if we find an <a class="definition" href="/Common/PopUps/popDefinition.aspx?id=CDR0000045098&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English" onclick="javascript:popWindow('defbyid','CDR0000045098&amp;version=Patient&amp;language=English'); return false;">inherited</a> genetic mutation,&rdquo; Dr. Raygada says.</p>

<p class="pullquote-text">I counsel patients to help them understand the implications of the results and then make decisions about their care based on those results. I also recommend a cancer screening or preventive plan for patients and their family.</p>

<p>An informative negative test can provide peace of mind to a patient that a harmful gene variant was not inherited. The genetic information is also used to help researchers better understand these rare tumor types.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most cancers occur sporadically. The majority of the testing we perform is for research, which is critical to identifying mutations that are causing these rare cancers,&rdquo; Dr. Raygada says. This makes genetic testing beneficial to patients regardless of whether their results are positive or negative.</p>
<h2><strong>Why Genetic Counseling for NCI-CONNECT</strong></h2>
<p>NCI-CONNECT aims to better understand select rare brain and spine tumors by collecting, analyzing and sharing data. Genetic testing is an opportunity for researchers to gather the data they need to reach this aim.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rare tumors are an underserved population in cancer research,&rdquo; Dr. Raygada says. &ldquo;Genetic testing allows for comprehensive testing of these tumors. It is a wonderful opportunity for patients, but it is also important that they understand it. That is why I am excited to be part of NCI-CONNECT.&rdquo;</p>
