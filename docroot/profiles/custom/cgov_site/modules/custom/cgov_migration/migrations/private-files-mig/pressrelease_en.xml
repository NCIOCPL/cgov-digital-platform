<p>In a new examination of United States cancer incidence data, investigators at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) reported that incidence trends have remained roughly constant for glioma, the main type of brain cancer hypothesized to be related to cell phone use. The researchers found that while cell phone use increased substantially over the period 1992 to2008 (from nearly zero to almost 100 percent of the population), the U.S. trends in glioma incidence did not mirror that increase. Results of this study were published online March 8, 2012, in the <i>British Medical Journal</i>.</p>
<p>The researchers compared the U.S. experience with that reported in two studies conducted in Europe, where cell phone use was widespread earlier than in the U.S.&nbsp; The two studies -- the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Interphone study, and a study in Sweden published in 2011-- provided the primary evidence for IARC&rsquo;s subsequent 2011 re-classification of&nbsp; microwave radiation produced by cell phones as a possible human carcinogen. (For more information, read the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_contentid=13651&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_folderid="" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="13651" sys_dependentvariantid="704" sys_relationshipid="6210281">NCI Statement on the IARC announcement</a>.) In this new analysis, NCI researchers compared the observed glioma incidence rates from 12 cancer registries in NCI&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program from 1992 to 2008, with projected rates based on risks observed in the Interphone and the Swedish study. Over the entire study period, glioma incidence patterns held roughly constant in all age groups. Projections based on the Interphone study, which found slight increases in risk among a small number of heavy users, were not statistically distinguishable from observed rates. On the other hand, projections based on the Swedish study were at least 40 percent higher than, and incompatible with, the actual rates. The authors recommend continued surveillance of glioma rates for a number of reasons, including changing usage patterns and technology, and because tumor latency may be longer than has been observed to date.</p>

<p>If all cigarette smoking in this country had ceased following the release of the first Surgeon General&rsquo;s report on smoking and health in 1964, a total of 2.5 million people would have been spared from death due to lung cancer in the 36 years following that report, according to the analysis. &nbsp;The results of this study were published online March 14, 2012, and in print on April 4, 2012 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute and expanded upon in the journal Risk Analysis online on August 7, 2012 and in the August 2012 print version with more details and specifics about the analysis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These findings provide a compelling illustration of the devastating impact of tobacco use in our nation and the enormous benefits of reducing rates of smoking,&rdquo; said <a href="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/od/director_rc.html">Robert Croyle, Ph.D.</a>, director of the <a href="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov">Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences</a> at NCI.&nbsp; &ldquo;Although great strides have been made, we cannot relax our efforts. &nbsp;The prevention and cessation of tobacco use continue to be vital priorities for the medical, scientific, and public health communities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The researchers, part of the NCI-sponsored <a href="http://cisnet.cancer.gov/index.html">Cancer Intervention and Surveillance Modeling Network</a> (CISNET), utilized a comparative modeling approach in which they constructed detailed cigarette smoking histories for individuals born from 1890 through 1970, and then related the histories to lung cancer mortality in mathematical models. &nbsp;Using these models, the researchers were able to estimate the impact of changes in smoking patterns resulting from tobacco control activities on lung cancer deaths during the period from 1975 through 2000.&nbsp; Since the 1964 report, tobacco control efforts in the United States have included restrictions on smoking in public places, increases in cigarette excise taxes, limits on underage access to cigarettes, and efforts to increase public awareness of the hazards of smoking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the first attempt to quantify the impact of changes in smoking behaviors on lung cancer mortality based on detailed reconstruction of cigarette smoking histories,&rdquo; said lead author Suresh Moolgavkar, M.D., Ph.D., of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. &nbsp;&ldquo;The methods that were developed as a part of this research should prove to be invaluable to other researchers investigating the adverse health impacts of cigarette smoking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the study, the researchers created three scenarios.&nbsp; In the first, called actual tobacco control, they used data on actual smoking behaviors of men and women in the United States. &nbsp;The second, called no tobacco control, predicted smoking behaviors that would have existed if no tobacco control policies were put in place. &nbsp;In the third, called complete tobacco control, the researchers examined the possible outcome if all smoking in the United States had ceased as of 1965, the first full year after the 1964 Surgeon General&rsquo;s Report on Smoking and Health was released.</p>
<p>The difference between lung cancer deaths in the no tobacco control scenario and the numbers of actual lung cancer deaths provided an estimate of the numbers of lung cancer deaths averted as a result of tobacco control activities. &nbsp;This difference is graphically represented in two charts accompanying this release, based on data from Yale University, which created one of the models used in this analysis.&nbsp; The researchers estimated that, without tobacco control programs and policies, an additional 552,000 men and 243,000 women would have died of lung cancer in the period from 1975 through 2000.</p>

<p>Similarly, the difference between the no tobacco control scenario and the complete tobacco control scenario provides an estimate of the lung cancer deaths that could have been avoided if everyone who smoked quit in 1965 and no one started smoking.&nbsp; If tobacco control efforts had been completely successful, an additional 1.7 million lung cancer deaths would have been averted from 1975 through 2000.&nbsp; In total, if all smoking had ceased completely in 1965, as many as 2.5 million fewer people would have died from lung cancer (1.6 million men and 883,000 women).</p>
<p>&ldquo;An overwhelming majority of lung cancer deaths can be prevented by eliminating cigarette smoking,&rdquo; said study author <a href="http://surveillance.cancer.gov/about/bios/feuerr.html">Eric Feuer, Ph.D.</a>, chief of NCI's <a href="http://surveillance.cancer.gov/branches/smab/">Statistical Methodology and Applications Branch</a>.&nbsp; &ldquo;The progress that has been made by tobacco control programs and policies in reducing lung cancer deaths represents about a third of the progress that could have been made if all cigarette smoking had ceased in 1965. &nbsp;This finding indicates that, while great strides have been made in tobacco control &ndash; averting hundreds of thousands of lung cancer deaths in the United States &ndash; continued and enhanced efforts have the potential to avert even more deaths.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The researchers estimations only run through the year 2000 because, for more recent years, sufficiently detailed data were unavailable when the project began. &nbsp;However, it can be inferred that additional lung cancer deaths have been averted since the year 2000, because according to previous research, smoking rates among U.S. adults have continued to fall, dropping from 23.2 percent in 2000 to 20.6 percent in 2008, and leveling off in recent years.&nbsp; Previous research indicates that much of the decrease in smoking rates can be attributed to tobacco control policies. &nbsp;In addition, although beyond the scope of the journal article, rates of other smoking related cancers, and smoking-related diseases, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, have declined due to tobacco control programs and policies.</p>
<p>In 2011, researchers conducting the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=6&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=821432" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="821432" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_relationshipid="6485077">National Lung Screening Trial</a> (NLST) found that screening heavy smokers with low-dose spiral CT reduced lung cancer mortality by 20 percent, compared to standard chest X-ray.&nbsp; Even with the potential mortality benefits associated with screening, continued implementation of evidence-based tobacco control policies, programs, and services remains a critical approach to reducing the burden of lung cancer, according to the authors.</p>
<p>CISNET is a consortium of NCI-sponsored investigators who use statistical modeling to improve our understanding of cancer control interventions in prevention, screening, and treatment.&nbsp; This modeling approach, which has been validated in several previous studies, can be used to guide public health research and priorities.&nbsp; The network is working on a project to study the efficacy of lung cancer screening for smokers in different age and exposure level groups, based on the results of benefit for spiral CT screening found in the NLST for heavy smokers.</p>
<p>The results discussed in the paper are based on six different models, developed by members of the CISNET network.&nbsp; The centers that created these models include Erasmus Medical Center, The Netherlands; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle; Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, Calverton, Md.; Rice University-M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston; Massachusetts General Hospital-Harvard Medical School, Boston; and Yale University, New Haven, Conn. &nbsp;More details about the construction of models will be published in a forthcoming special issue of Risk Analysis &ndash; An International Journal.</p>

While HAART is an integral part of successful KS therapy for people with AIDS, those with advanced KS rarely respond to HAART alone. Most often, the drug Doxil (liposomal doxorubicin) is combined with HAART to treat AIDS-KS patients, but due to cumulative cardiac toxicity, treatment with this drug must be stopped after reaching a defined safe dose. &#160;Results from this phase II clinical trial, by scientists at the National Cancer Institute, suggest that bevacizumab, combined with HAART, may be a beneficial new treatment for patients with HIV-KS. The results were published online March 19, 2012, in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.</p><p>KS tumors depend on the formation of new blood vessels for their growth. The lesions affect the skin or mouth and, in more severe cases, the lymph nodes, the lungs, or other internal organs. Since bevacizumab is known to block blood vessel growth, the investigators tested to see if it could block the growth of KS tumors. In this study, 17 AIDS-KS patients who were receiving HAART were given a regimen of intravenous bevacizumab for a median of 10 cycles. Most had advanced KS. Of the 16 patients who could be evaluated, 31percent had a partial or complete response.&#160; In addition, eight of 11 patients with baseline tumor-associated edema (a buildup of excess serous fluid between tissue cells) had improvement; six had a greater than two centimeter decrease in the circumference of the tumor in an affected limb; five had subjective improvements such as decreased pain or increased mobility and activity.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>Death rates from all cancers combined for men, women, and children continued to decline in the United States between 2004 and 2008, according to the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2008. The overall rate of new cancer diagnoses, also known as incidence, among men decreased by an average of 0.6 percent per year between 2004 and 2008.&nbsp; Overall cancer incidence rates among women declined 0.5 percent per year from 1998 through 2006 with rates leveling off from 2006 through 2008.</p>
<p>The report is co-authored by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries, the National Cancer Institute, and the American Cancer Society. It appeared early online on March 28, 2012, in the journal <i>CANCER.</i></p>
<p>The special feature section highlights the effects of excess weight and lack of physical activity on cancer risk. Esophageal adenocarcinoma, cancers of the colon and rectum, kidney cancer, pancreatic cancer, endometrial cancer, and breast cancer among postmenopausal women are associated with being overweight or obese. Several of these cancers also are associated with not being sufficiently physically active.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This report demonstrates the value of cancer registry data in identifying the links among physical inactivity, obesity, and cancer,&rdquo; said CDC Director Thomas R. Frieden, M.D. &ldquo;It also provides an update of how we are progressing in the fight against cancer by identifying populations with unhealthy behaviors and high cancer rates that can benefit from targeted, lifesaving strategies, and interventions to improve lifestyle behaviors and support healthy environments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For more than 30 years, excess weight, insufficient physical activity, and an unhealthy diet have been second only to tobacco as preventable causes of disease and death in the United States.&nbsp; However, since the 1960s, tobacco use has declined by a third while obesity rates have doubled, significantly impacting the relative contributions of these factors to the disease burden.&nbsp; Excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity have been linked to increased risk of cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, and arthritis, as well as many cancers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the United States, 2 in 3 adults are overweight or obese and fewer than half get enough physical activity,&rdquo; said John R. Seffrin, Ph.D., chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society. &ldquo;Between children and youth, 1 in 3 is overweight or obese, and fewer than 1 in 4 high school students get recommended levels of physical activity. Obesity and physical inactivity are critical problems facing all states. For people who do not smoke, excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity may be among the most important risk factors for cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Report to the Nation was first issued in 1998. In addition to drops in overall cancer mortality and incidence, this year's report also documents the second consecutive year of decreasing lung cancer mortality rates among women. Lung cancer death rates in men have been decreasing since the early 1990s.</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer incidence rates also decreased among men and women from 1999 through 2008.&nbsp; Breast cancer incidence rates among women declined from 1999 through 2004 and plateaued from 2004 through <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>2008.&nbsp; Incidence rates of some cancers, including pancreas, kidney, thyroid, liver, and melanoma, increased from 1999 through 2008.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The continued declines in death rates for all cancers, as well as the overall drop in incidence, is powerful evidence that the&nbsp; nation&rsquo;s investment in cancer research produces life-saving approaches to cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis, and treatment,&rdquo; said NCI Director Harold E. Varmus, M.D.&nbsp; &ldquo;But, it is also important to note that investments we make today are critical if we hope to see these declines in incidence and death from cancer reflected in future Reports to the Nation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Among children ages 19 years or younger, cancer incidence rates increased 0.6 percent per year from 2004 through 2008, continuing trends from 1992, while death rates decreased 1.3 percent per year during the same period. These patterns mirror longer-term trends.</p>

<p>Among racial and ethnic groups, the highest cancer incidence rates between 2004 and 2008 were among black men and white women. Cancer death rates from 2004 through 2008 were highest among black men and black women, but these groups showed the largest declines for the period between 1999 and 2008, compared with other racial groups. The differences in death rates by racial/ethnic group, sex, and cancer site may reflect differences in risk factors, as well as access to and use of screening and treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While the sustained decline in cancer mortality rates is good news, the persistence of disparities among racial and ethnic groups continues to concern us,&rdquo; said Betsy A. Kohler, executive director of NAACCR. &ldquo;The collection of comprehensive cancer surveillance data on all patients may provide clues to understanding these differences and addressing them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report notes that continued progress against cancer in the United States will require individual and community efforts to promote healthy weight and sufficient physical activity among youth and adults.</p>

<li>
<p><b>What is the purpose of this report and who created it?</b><br />This report provides a regular update of cancer incidence (new cases) and mortality (death) rates and trends in these rates in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Cancer Society, the National Cancer Institute (part of the National Institutes of Health), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries have collaborated since 1998 to create the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The special section of this year's report highlights increased cancer risk associated with excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity and emphasizes the importance of promoting healthy weight and sufficient physical activity in reducing the cancer burden in the United States.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What are the sources of the data?</b><br />Cancer mortality information in the United States is based on causes of death reported by physicians on death certificates and filed by each state's vital statistics offices. The mortality information is processed and consolidated in a national database by the CDC through the National Vital Statistics System, which covers the entire United States.</p>
<p>Information on newly diagnosed cancer cases occurring in the U.S. is based on data collected by registries in the CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. NAACCR evaluates data annually from registries in both programs and provides combined data for this analysis.</p>
<p>Long-term (1992 through 2008) trends for all races for all cancer sites combined and for the 15 most common cancers were based on SEER incidence data covering about 14 percent of the U.S. population. Data from combined NPCR and SEER population-based cancer registries were used to estimate cancer incidence rates and short-term (1999 through 2008) trends for each of five major racial and ethnic groups: white, black, Asian and Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic. For the time period 2004-2008, 48 registries (covering 96 percent of the U.S. population) met NAACCR data quality criteria and for the time period 1999-2008, 41 registries (covering 86 percent of the U.S. population) met these criteria.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Which reporting periods were chosen as a main focus of the report?</b><br />The period from 2004 through 2008 was used for describing the U.S. burden of cancer (rates), and the period from 1999 through 2008 was used for describing trends in cancer incidence and death rates among the country's five major racial and ethnic groups. The period from 1975 through 2008 was chosen to represent the best perspective on long-term trends in cancer death rates among all races combined, while the period from 1992 through 2008 was chosen to represent the best perspective on long-term incidence trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is detailed in the Special Feature of this year's report?</b><br />In this year's Special Feature, the authors highlight the effects of excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity on cancer risk. Several cancers, including esophageal adenocarcinoma and cancers of the colon and rectum, kidney, pancreas, endometrium, as well as breast cancer among postmenopausal women, are associated with being overweight or obese; several of these cancers also are associated with not being sufficiently physically active.</p>

<h3>Update on Incidence and Mortality Trends for All Cancer Sites Combined and the Top 15 Cancers</h3>
<ol start="5">
<li>
<p id="que5"><b>What is happening with cancer incidence trends overall?</b><br />From 2004 through 2008 incidence rates for all cancers combined declined 0.6 percent per year among men. Among women, cancer incidence rates declined 0.5 percent per year from 1998 to 2006 with rates leveling off from 2006 to 2008 (see table 1 of the manuscript).</p>
<p>Declines in cancer mortality rates are always good news; the same is not always true for incidence rates.&nbsp; Declines in cancer incidence rates may occur as a result of decreased modifiable risk factors or, for example, increased use of colorectal and cervical cancer screening tests that prevent cancer by removing precancerous growths. Alternatively, the incidence of some cancers could appear to decrease over time if screening rates fall and, thus, cancers are not detected and/or they are found at an advanced stage.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is happening with long-term incidence trends for the top 15 cancers?</b><br />Among men, incidence rates for 5 of the 17 most common cancers &ndash; prostate, lung and bronchus colon and rectum (colorectal), stomach, and larynx &ndash; decreased between 1999 through 2008. &nbsp;In contrast, rates among men increased from 1999 through 2008 for 7 cancers: kidney and renal pelvis, pancreas, liver and intrahepatic bile duct, thyroid, melanoma of the skin, leukemia, and myeloma.</p>
<p>Among women, incidence rates decreased from 1999 through 2008 for 6 of the 18 most common cancers: lung, colorectal, urinary bladder (bladder), cervix uteri (cervix), oral cavity and pharynx (oral cavity) and stomach. Incidence rates among women increased from 1999 through 2008 for 6 cancers: thyroid, melanoma of the skin, kidney and renal pelvis, pancreas, leukemia, and liver.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is happening with incidence trends for breast cancer?</b><br />Breast cancer incidence rates, which increased 1.3 percent per year from 1992 through 1999, declined 2.0 percent per year from 1999 through 2005 and leveled off from 2005 through 2008. &nbsp;The factors that influence breast cancer incidence are complex, including changes in reproductive status, obesity, the prevalence of mammography screening, and others. Recent reports suggest that the decrease in breast cancer incidence may be related to the rapid discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy, a known risk factor for breast cancer, and also because of a plateau in mammography screening prevalence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="que8"><b>What is happening with cancer mortality trends overall?</b><br />Among men and women, overall cancer death rates have continued to decrease since the early 1990s and declined an average of 1.6 percent per year between 2004 and 2008.&nbsp; For 2004 through 2008, this decline was slightly more pronounced among men (1.7 percent per year) than among women (1.5 percent per year). For children ages 19 years or younger, cancer death rates have declined since the 1970s. Death rates are the best indicator of progress against cancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is happening with death rates for the top 15 cancers among men and women?</b><br />Among men, death rates decreased from 1999 through 2008 for 11 of the 17 most common cancers including lung, colon and rectum, prostate, larynx, kidney, brain, stomach, oral cavity, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and myeloma. Death rates among men increased during this time period for pancreatic and liver cancers and melanoma of the skin.</p>
<p>Among women, death rates decreased from 1999 through 2008 for 14 of the 18 most common cancers including lung, breast, colon and rectum, ovary, kidney, brain, stomach, oral cavity, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, urinary bladder, esophagus and gallbladder. Death rates among women increased during this time period for cancers of the pancreas and corpus uterus (uterine). After decades of decline, cervical cancer death rates showed little change in the most recent period.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>If cancer death rates continue to fall, does that mean the number of people dying from cancer will also continue to fall?</b><br />Not necessarily. The data described in the report are rates (number of deaths per 100,000 persons in the United States) and are adjusted for age, so they are comparable across various factors, such as race, time, and region. The actual number of people dying from cancer (sometimes called the count) can be influenced by several factors, including the growth in the number of older people in the United States (cancer is primarily a disease of aging) and the increase in size of the population.</p>
<p>Therefore, while the cancer death rate may go down in a given year, the actual number of cancer deaths could go up because the number of older Americans is increasing and the size of the population overall is increasing.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is happening with childhood cancer rates?</b><br />Cancer incidence rates increased 0.6 percent each year from 1992 through 2008 among children ages 19 years or younger.&nbsp; However, considerable progress has been seen for many types of childhood cancers, resulting in overall declines in death rates for cancer among children since at least 1975. Death rates declined 2.7 percent per year between 1975 and 1996 and declined 1.3 percent per year between 1996 and 2008. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Cancers associated with excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity</h3>
<ol start="12">
<li>
<p id="que12"><b>What is the importance of excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity to cancer?</b><br />Excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity are avoidable (can be modified) causes of cancer in the United States. The International Agency for Research on Cancer concluded that one-quarter to one-third of common cancers in the United States and other industrialized nations were caused by the joint effects of excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity. For people who do not smoke, maintaining a healthy weight and getting sufficient physical activity may be among the most important ways to prevent cancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What cancers are associated with excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity?</b><br />An <a href="http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/">extensive literature review</a> of more than 7,000 studies on the relationship between nutrition, physical activity, and excess weight on cancer risk concluded there is convincing evidence of an association between excess weight and increased risk for several cancers. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Adenocarcinoma of the esophagus</li>
<li>Colon and rectum cancer</li>
<li>Kidney cancer</li>
<li>Pancreatic cancer</li>
<li>Post-menopausal female breast cancer</li>
<li>Corpus uterus (uterine) cancer</li>
</ul>
<p>There also is some evidence that excess weight is probably associated with other cancers including thyroid, liver, gallbladder, and hematopoietic (e.g., leukemia and myeloma) cancers.</p>
<p>This review also concluded that the evidence of an association between lack of sufficient physical activity and increased risk of cancer is considered convincing for colon cancer and probable for post-menopausal breast and endometrial cancers.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is known about the relationship between obesity and breast cancer?</b><br />The relationship between obesity and breast cancer may be affected by the stage of life in which a woman gains weight and becomes overweight or obese. Some studies indicate that overweight and obesity are associated with a reduced risk of premenopausal breast cancer. In contrast, after menopause, when the risk of developing breast cancer is higher than before menopause, gaining weight or being overweight or obese is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. While many risk factors for breast cancer are out of a women's control, maintaining a healthy weight throughout life and getting sufficient physical activity may help women protect themselves against developing breast cancer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is happening with incidence rates for cancers associated with excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity?</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Colorectal cancer incidence rates decreased from 1999 through 2008, partially due to significant improvements in adherence in the use of colorectal cancer screening, which can prevent cancer development through removal of precancerous adenomatous polyps.</li>
<li>Rates of postmenopausal breast cancer stabilized from 2005 through 2008 after declining from 1999 through 2005, mostly due to the rapid discontinuation of hormone replacement therapy, a known risk factor for breast cancer.</li>
<li>Kidney cancer incidence increased from 1999 through 2008 by approximately 2.9 percent per year among men (accelerating to 4.1 percent from 2004 through 2008) and by 3.3 percent among women; increases are evident in all racial and ethnic groups.</li>
<li>Pancreatic cancer incidence rates increased approximately 1.2 percent per year from 1999 through 2008 (accelerating slightly from 2004 to 2008) among men and women. This increase was confined to whites.</li>
<li>For corpus uterus (uterine) cancer, a significant increase from 1999 through 2008 was observed among black, Asian and Pacific Islander, and Hispanic women; a non-significant increase was observed among white and American Indian/Alaska Native women.</li>
<li>From 1992 through 2008 adenocarcinoma of the esophagus increased 2.6 percent per year among men and 3.3 percent per year among women; these increases were restricted to white and Hispanic men and white women.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>What are the recommendations for weight and physical activity for children and adults?</b><br />The <a href="http://health.gov/dietaryguidelines/2010.asp"><i>2010 Dietary Guidelines for Americans</i></a> recommends that people prevent and/or reduce excess weight and obesity through improved eating and physical activity behaviors. Children ages 6 to 17 years should do at least 60 minutes of physical activity each day and adults should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity or an equivalent combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity activity every week. To prevent cancer, the <a href="http://www.cancer.org/Healthy/EatHealthyGetActive/ACSGuidelinesonNutritionPhysicalActivityforCancerPrevention/acs-guidelines-on-nutrition-and-physical-activity-for-cancer-prevention-intro">American Cancer Society recommends</a> that individuals "be as lean as possible throughout life without being underweight" and that adults "engage in at least 150 minutes of moderate intensity or 75 minutes of vigorous intensity activity each week, or an equivalent combination."</li>
<li><b>Why are there disparities in the prevalence of obesity rates throughout the nation?</b><br />Substantial differences exist in obesity prevalence across racial/ethnic groups. Some reasons for these differences include social and cultural factors coupled with environments that have limited opportunities for physical activity and an abundance of high-calorie foods. For example, neighborhoods with large minority populations tend to have fewer chain supermarkets and produce stores, often making it more difficult and costly for residents to obtain healthier foods. Also, breastfeeding, which is associated with reduced prevalence of childhood obesity, is more common among white women than black women. Further, data show that blacks and Mexican Americans are less likely to get regular leisure physical activity than whites<i>.</i>&nbsp; [Note: most data are on leisure time physical activity; blacks and Mexican Americans may be getting occupational activity]
<p>Social and cultural factors concerning body weight may also play a role in racial/ethnic differences in obesity prevalence. It has been reported that black and Hispanic women are more satisfied with their body size, making it less likely that these groups will try to lose weight than white women.&nbsp; Additionally, cooking preparation methods can impact diet quality among regional and racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>There are also differences in obesity prevalence by household income level, according to a recent national nutrition and health survey report. Among non-Hispanic white boys, girls, and adult females, the prevalence of obesity decreased as income level increased; in other words, in these groups, low-income individuals had a higher prevalence of obesity than high-income individuals.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>What is being done to address obesity disparities?</b><br />An increased emphasis on systems change and environmental strategies that support healthy eating and active living opportunities within communities may reduce these disparities. CDC supports programs that use environmental approaches to improve access to healthy foods in underserved communities, such as increased accessibility of supermarkets and convenience stores that carry healthier products; expanding programs that promote the delivery of regionally-grown farm produce to community institutions, WIC farmers' markets, and to individuals via green carts and mobile vans in inner city neighborhoods; and promotion of food policy councils that consider both food security and&nbsp; improvements of the food environment at the state and local levels. School and child care initiatives include support for healthier beverage and food offerings such as water and fruits and vegetables. &nbsp;Strategies to increase low- or no-cost physical activity opportunities in communities include providing trails and parks, shared-use agreements with public venues such as schools, and improvements to sidewalks.&nbsp; These strategies can potentially reduce disparities in obesity.</p>
<p>Additionally, nationwide efforts, including federally-supported state, tribal, and local prevention initiatives and the federal government's Let's Move campaign are helping to mobilize public and private resources and partnerships, which, in turn, provide guidance and funding to states and communities to encourage use of strategies to improve diet and physical activity.</p>
<p>While policy and environmental approaches can support individuals' decisions regarding healthy eating and physical activity, individual choices regarding what to eat and whether to exercise also play an important role in obesity prevention. For children in particular, parents must be aware of and take steps to promote healthy child feeding practices, family meals, modeling healthy eating and physical activity, ensuring access to healthy foods in the home, as well as reducing children's sedentary television and screen time while finding fun and inexpensive opportunities for physical activity in the home and neighborhood environment.</p>

<li>
<p><b>What is the economic burden attributed to excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity?</b><br />The economic burden due to excess weight and lack of sufficient physical activity is substantial. According to recent <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=annual%20medical%20spending%20attributable%20to%20obesity%3A%20payer%20and%20service%20specific%20estimates">data</a>, per capita medical spending in the U.S. in 2008 for an obese individual was 42 percent higher ($1,429) per year compared with someone of normal weight, resulting in a national burden of $147 billion, or about 9.1 percent of all medical spending. In addition to medical costs, indirect costs of obesity include decreased years of disability-free life, increased mortality before retirement, earlier retirement, higher disability pensions, increased work absenteeism and reduced productivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is the summary evidence linking obesity, physical inactivity, and cancer?</b><br />Evidence on the association between obesity and cancer has been building since the 1970s. Evidence on the association between physical activity and cancer has been accumulating in the last 20 years.&nbsp; Several analyses of these studies have been conducted by independent researchers.</p>
<p>In 2001, the World Cancer Research Fund, along with the American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF/AICR), commissioned 20 review panels to conduct systematic literature reviews on the association among food, nutrition, physical activity and the prevention of cancer (available for cancers of mouth, pharynx and larynx, nasopharynx, esophagus, lung, stomach, pancreas, gallbladder, liver, colon and rectum, breast, ovary, endometrium, cervix, prostate, kidney and skin, as well as colorectal polyps). More than 7,000 studies were reviewed in the process. These findings were reported in the <a href="http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/expert_report/index.php">2007 2<sup>nd</sup> Expert Report</a> , the <a href="http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/policy_report/index.php">2008 Policy Report</a>, and the <a href="http://www.dietandcancerreport.org/cup/current_progress/breast_cancer.php">Continuous Update on Breast Cancer in 2010</a>. <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>WCRF/AICR concluded that there is convincing evidence of an association between excess weight and increased risk of several cancers, including adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, colon and rectum cancer, kidney cancer, pancreas cancer, post-menopausal female breast cancer, and endometrial cancer. WCRF/AICR also concluded that the evidence of an association between physical inactivity and increased risk of cancer is considered convincing (colon cancer) or probable (post-menopausal breast and endometrial cancers).</p>
<p>In 2002, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Working Group on the Evaluation of Cancer, Preventive Strategies published a <a href="http://www.iarc.fr/en/publications/pdfs-online/prev/handbook6/index.php">comprehensive evaluation</a> of the available scientific literature, including studies in people and animals, weight, physical activity, and cancer. IARC concluded that excess weight increases the risk of developing cancers of the colon, breast (in postmenopausal women), endometrium, kidney, and esophageal adenocarcinoma and that physical activity prevented colon and breast cancers.</p>

<h3>How to Read This Report</h3>
<ol start="21">
<li><b>How are cancer incidence and death rates presented?</b><br />Cancer incidence rates and death rates are typically measured as the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 people per year and are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population. When a cancer affects only one sex&mdash;for example, prostate cancer&mdash;then the number is per 100,000 persons of that sex. The numbers are age-adjusted, which allows for comparison of rates from different populations with varying age composition over time and in different regions. It is noteworthy that breast cancer occurs in both men and women, although it occurs less frequently in men.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>What is annual percent change or APC?</b><br />The annual percent change (APC) is the average rate of change in a cancer rate per year in a given time frame (i.e., how fast or slowly a cancer rate has increased or decreased each year over a period of years). The APC was calculated for both incidence and death rates. The number is given as a percent, such as an approximate 1 percent per year decrease. The APC is calculated using joinpoint regression (see below for an explanation of joinpoints).
<p>A negative APC describes a decreasing trend, and a positive APC describes an increasing trend. In this report, all trends mentioned in the text are statistically significant (<i>P</i> &lt; .05) unless noted otherwise. For non-statistically significant trends, terms such as "stable," "non-significant increase," and "non-significant decrease" were used.</p>
<p>To find the total increase or decrease over the time period being examined, multiply the APC by the number of years in the time period. For example, if the APC for the time period 2004-2008 is -0.6 percent,&nbsp; then the total percent change for the 5 year period would be -3 percent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is average annual percent change or AAPC?</b><br />This year's report uses the average annual percent change (AAPC) as an addendum to the underlying joinpoint (see below for an explanation of joinpoints) annual percent change (APC) trends as a summary measure to compare fixed interval trends among racial and ethnic groups.&nbsp; The AAPC quantifies the average trend over a fixed period of multiple years.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Similar to the APC, a negative AAPC describes a decreasing trend, and a positive AAPC describes an increasing trend. In this report, all trends are statistically significant (<i>P</i> &lt; .05) unless noted otherwise. For non-statistically significant trends, terms such as "stable," "non-significant increase," and "non-significant decrease" were used.</p>
<p>The APC and the AAPC are similar when trends are relatively stable over time. For most long-term trends in this report, the AAPCs for the most recent five years, 2004 through 2008, were similar to the APCs for the most recent time period. When trends fluctuate over time, the 10-year (1999-2008) AAPCs may differ from the most recent APCs, e.g., all sites combined for men and women, and cancers of the prostate and pancreas in men, and cancers of the breast, pancreas, and ovary, in women.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Long-term trends can obscure shorter term changes.&nbsp; Differences in the five-year and 10-year AAPCs typically identify types of cancer where the 10-year average trend may mask important recent changes.&nbsp; For example, in this report the trend for lung cancer deaths shows a more rapid decline when looking at the five-year AAPC than the 10-year AAPC.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<h3>Data Adjustments</h3>
<ol start="24">
<li>
<p><b>Why were rates adjusted for delays in reporting incidence data to SEER?</b><br />The report presents analyses of long-term trends in cancer incidence rates with and without adjustment for reporting delays and more complete information. Adjusting for these delays and accumulating more complete and accurate information provides the basis for a potentially more definitive assessment of incidence rates and trends in the most recent years for which data are available. Cancer registries routinely take two to three years to compile their current cancer statistics. An additional one to two years may be required to have more complete incidence data on certain cancers, such as melanomas and leukemias when they are diagnosed in outpatient settings. Cancer registries continue to update incidence rates to include these cases. Consequently, the data initially reported for certain cancer incidence rates may be an underestimate. Long-term reporting patterns in NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) registries have been analyzed, and it is now possible to adjust incidence rates for all cancers combined and for site-specific cancers with a correction for expected reporting delays and more complete information.&nbsp; However, SEER registries do not cover the entire population, thus combined data from SEER and CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries are important for assessing the incidence of cancer in the U.S. Methodological research is in progress to adjust for reporting delays of pooled data.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is joinpoint regression analysis and how does it account for the different time periods used for trends analysis in this report?</b><br />Joinpoint regression analysis is a statistical method that describes changing trends over successive segments of time and the amount of increase or decrease within each segment. This analysis involves fitting a series of joined straight lines to the age-adjusted rates and choosing the best-fitting point or points, called joinpoints, where the rate of increase or decrease changes significantly. Thus, each joinpoint denotes a statistically significant change in trend. The resulting line segment between joinpoints can be described by an annual percent change that is based on the slope of the line segment. Joinpoint analyses were performed for incidence and mortality trends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What other data issues need to be considered?</b><br />This report uses population data from the U.S. Census Bureau to calculate incidence and death rates.&nbsp; Differences between the true population counts and postcensal population estimates may increase as time passes from the 2000 Census. These differences may result in incidence and death rates being either underestimated or overestimated.</p>
<p>Incidence data for 2005 through 2008 were affected by data sharing restrictions within the Veterans Health Administration (VHA). VHA hospitals have traditionally been a critical source of data for cancer cases diagnosed among veterans served by those institutions. The new requirements restrict the submission of cancer cases to central cancer registries, however, resulting in incomplete reporting of VA hospital cases in some registries.&nbsp; VA cases account for at least 3 percent and possibly as much as 8 percent of all cancer cases diagnosed among men. Therefore, incidence rates for men may be underestimated.&nbsp; Since late 2008, VA facilities and states with central cancer registries have worked to establish data transfer agreements that may help cancer registries receive missing VA cases over time and provide a more complete estimate of national cancer incidence.</p>

<p>Preliminary results from clinical trials in a subtype of lymphoma show that for a number of patients whose disease was not cured by other treatments, the drug ibrutinib can provide significant anti-cancer responses with modest side effects.&#160; These results were presented as part of the opening plenary session at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) Annual Meeting 2012 on April 1 by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues.&#160;</p>

<p>Lymphomas are the fifth most common form of cancer. They are caused by an abnormal proliferation of white blood cells, can occur at any age, and are often marked by lymph nodes that are larger than normal, fever, and weight loss. Diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL), which were studied in this trial, are aggressive cancers that grow rapidly and represent 30 percent to 40 percent of newly diagnosed lymphomas. &#160;DLBCL originates from B cells, which play a crucial role in the body’s immune response.</p>

<p>There have been no major advances in the treatment of DLBCL in more than a decade. However, important advances have been made in understanding that this disease is comprised of at least three molecular subtypes, each derived from B cells at unique stages in their development. The activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of DLBCL accounts for approximately 40 percent of cases and has the poorest clinical outcome with current therapy.&#160;</p>

<p>Recent genetic studies have revealed that chronic activity of receptors that sit on the surface of B cells play an important role in the progression of ABC lymphomas.&#160; In normal B cells, these B-cell receptors help the cells recognize infections.&#160; In malignant B cells of ABC lymphomas, these receptors provide crucial signals that promote tumor cell survival.&#160; Over one-fifth of ABC tumors have mutations that alter the activity of the B-cell receptor.&#160; Based on these findings, researchers looked for ways to target B-cell receptor signaling therapeutically.&#160; This research identified the enzyme Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK) as a key element in the B-cell receptor pathway that is required to maintain the survival of ABC lymphoma cells.</p>

<p>“Our trial is a prime example of precision medicine,” said Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., deputy chief, Metabolism Branch at NCI. “A better understanding of the changes in cancer cells is leading us to what we hope will be more effective treatment strategies tailored to the genetic profile of each patient’s cancer.”</p>

<p>Based on this molecular research, investigators chose to use the drug ibrutinib (formerly PCI-32765), a potent inhibitor of BTK, in their clinical trials.&#160; Ibrutinib is an oral, highly specific and irreversible inhibitor of the BTK enzyme.&#160; Pharmacyclics Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., and Janssen Research and Development, L.L.C., Horsham, Pa., are developing the drug to target B-cell malignancies, including various forms of leukemia, lymphoma and multiple myeloma.</p>

<p>In studies led by Staudt and his NCI colleague, Wyndham Wilson, M.D., ibrutinib was first evaluated in a pilot trial at NCI in ABC DLBCL, and is now being evaluated in an ongoing multicenter study in DLBCL.&#160; Results from the pilot trial and individual cases from the ongoing trial indicate that the use of the single agent pill form of ibrutinib can elicit major anti-lymphoma effects with minimal side effects.&#160;</p>

<p>Participants in these studies were given ibrutinib as a pill at a fixed dose of 560 milligrams daily until the disease progresses. &#160;Ibrutinib induced multiple responses including some complete remissions in ABC lymphomas.&#160; Remissions were also observed in patients with non-ABC DLBCL, suggesting a broader role for the B-cell receptor pathway in this type of lymphoma. A final analysis will provide additional insights into the safety and efficacy of ibrutinib in the treatment of DLBCL.</p>

<p>“These results illustrate how an understanding of the molecular machinery inside a cancer cell can lead to new therapies which can kill tumor cells while sparing normal cells, thus greatly reducing toxicities for patients,” said Staudt.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">STUDY RESULTS</span></b></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p id="que1"><b>How was the diesel study designed?</b><br />The Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study (DEMS) was designed to evaluate the risk of death associated with diesel exhaust exposure, particularly as it may relate to lung cancer. The study was carried out by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH). It includes two complementary components: a retrospective cohort mortality study of 12,315 workers at eight non-metal mining facilities; and a nested case-control study of lung cancer deaths in the cohort to investigate risk of lung cancer after taking into account smoking and other lung cancer risk factors. Elevated mortality from other causes among diesel exhaust-exposed miners was examined as well. The researchers undertook an extensive effort to characterize current and historical exposures to diesel exhaust and to develop estimates of personal exposures for each worker in the cohort.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="que2"><b>What was the main result of the study?</b><br />The researchers observed increased risk for lung cancer death with increasing levels of exposure to diesel exhaust. Risks among heavily exposed workers were about three times greater than risk among workers with low exposure to diesel exhaust.</p>
<p>They also reported that non-smokers with the high levels of diesel exposure were seven times more likely to die from lung cancer than non-smokers in the lowest exposure category.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>The study shows risk for lung cancer death dropped off for heavy smokers in the highest diesel exhaust exposure category. Why?</b><br />Among low and moderate smokers, the risk of lung cancer increased with increasing diesel exposure. In contrast, among miners who were heavy smokers (two or more packs per day) the risk of lung cancer death for those with the highest levels of exposure to diesel exhaust was attenuated. Their risk remained elevated but tapered off with increasing levels of exposure. Despite the leveling off of risk in the heavily diesel-exposed smokers, the researchers stress that there is no safe level of smoking.</p>
<p>The researchers offered a number of possible explanations for the tapering off of risk at high levels of diesel exhaust exposure. First, it is possible that smokers are more likely to clear diesel exhaust particulate matter from their lungs than non-smokers. This phenomenon has been reported among coal miners who are heavy smokers. Second, carcinogens in diesel exhaust and cigarette smoke may operate in the same metabolic pathway in the body. If so, they may compete with each other, resulting in a saturation of the pathway, thus diminishing the effects of either component.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>In this study, what is &ldquo;lagging&rdquo; exposure? Why is lagging important?</b><br />Lagging is an analytic technique that removes from consideration exposures in the years just preceding death which are likely to be too recent to be responsible for cancer. It is generally thought to take approximately 15 to 20 or more years to develop lung cancer. The strongest associations in this study were observed when exposures lagged for 15 years.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>In the case-control study, information on smoking and other confounders was based on interview data that were not available in the cohort study. These interviews were mainly conducted with next of kin because the subject was deceased. How did the researchers address possible recall bias from next of kin of the cases?</b><br />In order to evaluate possible recall bias, the researchers carried out a comparison of data on possible confounders (for example, smoking history) gathered directly from living study participants and from next of kin for deceased control subjects. This comparison suggested that data from next of kin and data from directly interviewed subjects on smoking and other confounders were fairly comparable. Still, the possibility of some recall bias cannot be completely ruled out.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How were the mines selected?</b><br />The study mines were selected from all U.S. underground non-metal mining facilities with at least 50 employees. Non-metal mines were used to avoid confounding from radon in particular. The mines that were eligible for the study had high ambient levels of diesel exhaust but also low levels of other potential carcinogens associated with lung cancer risk, such as radon, silica, and asbestos. The facilities were located in Missouri (1 limestone mine), New Mexico (3 potash mines), Ohio (1 salt mine), and Wyoming (3 trona mines; trona is an ore used in making soda ash).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What is unique about this study?</b><br />According to the investigators, this is the first study based on estimates of quantitative historical exposure to diesel exhaust to yield a statistically significant, positive increase in lung cancer risk with increasing diesel exposure after taking smoking and other potential lung cancer risk factors into account.</p>
<p>Also, the alternate effect of heavy diesel exhaust among heavy smokers has not been previously observed (see question 3) and will need to be replicated.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How was diesel exhaust measured in this study?</b><br />Diesel exhaust is made up of many components, which makes it difficult to measure. In this study, diesel exhaust levels were quantified by measurements and estimates of one of its components, respirable elemental carbon, which is considered the best index of diesel exhaust in underground mining. Quantitative estimates of exposure were determined by piecing together information from many different sources for each of eight study mines over time. The methods for this effort were published previously in four papers in the <i>Annals of Occupational Hygiene</i> (Volume 54, Issue 7, October 2010) and can be found at <a href="http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/7.toc">http://annhyg.oxfordjournals.org/content/54/7.toc</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Were exposures different at the surface of a facility compared to underground?</b><br />All of the mines in the study had operations both at the surface and underground. The levels of diesel exhaust sustained by workers underground far exceeded exposures for workers at the surface.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>Where should future research focus?</b><br />Research is needed to understand the mechanisms of action in diesel exhaust-induced lung cancer, and to confirm the observed interaction between diesel exhaust exposure and heavy smoking, where the effect of one was attenuated in the presence of high levels of the other. This relationship has not been previously observed (though studies of coal miners and residents in rural China, whose indoor cooking stoves run on smoky coal, have shown a similar diminution of the smoking effect). Future research will be needed to replicate this finding before drawing any conclusions about the interaction between diesel exhaust and smoking.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT</span></b></p>
</li>
<li>
<p id="que11"><b>Can findings from this study be generalized to other occupationally exposed groups (e.g., truck drivers, longshoremen)?</b><br />Although the investigators studied miners with very high exposure levels, workers in other settings are also exposed to diesel exhaust. These study results should be broadly applicable to other workers with similar levels of exposure to diesel exhaust.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How do exposures in the study relate to average exposures in the general population (e.g., commuters)?</b><br />The workers in this study experienced a wide range of exposure levels. In urban areas with heavy pollution from diesel exhaust, environmental exposures for the general population may be in the range of 2 to 6 micrograms (&micro;g) of respirable elemental carbon per cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>). If accumulated over a lifetime (e.g. 60 years), this exposure approximates the cumulative exposures experienced by underground miners with the lowest exposures in this study (60 years x 2-6 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>=120-360 &micro;g/m<sup>3</sup>). Workers with this exposure level experienced about a 50 percent increased lung cancer risk.</p>
<p>However, based on this study, researchers cannot estimate with certainty the risks from diesel exposure for very low levels of pollution in the general environment. The study will provide valuable data for risk assessors to extrapolate down from high to low levels of diesel exhaust exposure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>What governmental organizations set standards or recommend limits for exposure?</b><br /><br /><i><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the workplace</span></b></i><br />For workplace settings, there are a number of safety standards in place to limit exposure to diesel exhaust. The Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) has <a href="http://www.msha.gov/01-995/dieselpart.HTM">rules to limit diesel particulate matter exposure for underground miners in both coal and metal/nonmetal mines.</a> For other workers, the <a href="http://www.osha.gov/SLTC/dieselexhaust">Occupational Safety and Health Administration</a> (OSHA) is the responsible agency.</p>
<p><i><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">For the general public</span></b></i><br />For the general public, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has put in place <a href="http://www.epa.gov/diesel/">policies to reduce diesel pollution</a> and help ensure cleaner air.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><b>How will these findings impact U.S. regulations for diesel exhaust levels for underground mining?</b><br />It will be up to the regulators to determine whether the current acceptable level should be lowered. For the mining industry, the responsible agency is <a href="http://www.msha.gov/">MSHA</a>. <a href="http://www.msha.gov/01-995/dieselpartmnm.htm">MSHA&rsquo;s diesel particulate final rules</a> for non-metal miners are available online. As of May 20, 2008, a miner&rsquo;s personal exposure to diesel particulate matter (DPM) in an underground non-metal mine must not exceed an average eight-hour equivalent full shift airborne concentration of 160 micrograms of total carbon per cubic meter of air (160&mu;g/m<sup>3</sup>).</p>
<p>For all other occupationally-exposed workers, the responsible agency is <a href="http://www.osha.gov/">OSHA</a>.</p>

<p><b>How common is lung cancer?</b><br />It is estimated that there will be 226,160 new cases of lung cancer in the United States and 160,340 deaths from lung cancer (non-small cell and small cell combined) in 2012. For more information on lung cancer, visit the <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=12897&amp;sys_revision=49&amp;sys_variantid=814&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_folderid="" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="12897" sys_dependentvariantid="814" sys_relationshipid="6210233">NCI Lung Cancer page</a>.</p>

Crizotinib works by blocking the activity of a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase, or ALK, and it is effective in adults whose tumors have alterations in the <i>ALK</i> gene that increase the activity of the ALK protein<i>.</i> Studies have shown that adults with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) harboring <i>ALK</i> gene alterations can be successfully treated with crizotinib. The drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating such patients.&#160; <i>ALK</i> gene alterations are present in nearly all children with ALCL and in about 10 percent of children with neuroblastoma. <i>ALK</i> gene alterations also occur occasionally in other childhood cancers. <p>&#8220;There is a major opportunity to personalize therapy for children with neuroblastoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma by providing a relatively non-toxic drug that may allow us to lower the doses of conventional chemotherapy in the very near future,&#8221; said Yael P.

<p>Flexible sigmoidoscopy, a screening test for colorectal cancer that is less invasive and has fewer side effects than colonoscopy, is effective in reducing the rates of new cases and deaths due to colorectal cancer, according to research sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. In a study that spanned almost 20 years, researchers found that overall colorectal cancer mortality (deaths) was reduced by 26 percent and incidence (new cases) was reduced by 21 percent as a result of screening with sigmoidoscopy.&nbsp; These results appeared online, ahead of print, on May 21, 2012, in the New England Journal of Medicine, and were presented at <a href="http://www.ddw.org">Digestive Disease Week</a>, a scientific conference.</p>
<p>Sigmoidoscopy involves examination of the lower colon using a thin, flexible tube-like instrument, called a sigmoidoscope, to view the anus, rectum, and sigmoid colon (see Figure 1).&nbsp; Sigmoidoscopy has fewer side effects, requires less bowel preparation, and poses a lower risk of bowel perforation (an uncommon event, when the screening instrument pokes a hole in the intestine) than colonoscopy, in which a similarly flexible, but longer, tube is used to view the entire colon.</p>
<p>Colorectal cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer-related death in the United States.&nbsp; Previous research has shown that colorectal cancer incidence and mortality can be reduced with a number of screening methods, including <a href="http://benchmarks.cancer.gov/2010/03/the-role-of-fecal-occult-blood-testing-in-colorectal-cancer-screening/">fecal occult blood testing</a> (FOBT). However, flexible sigmoidoscopy and colonoscopy are more sensitive than FOBT for detecting polyps (see Figure 2) that may lead to colorectal cancer. Removal of pre-cancerous polyps, which can be done during sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy, reduces colorectal cancer risk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The most important message is that, regardless of modality chosen, colorectal cancer screening lowers mortality from colorectal cancer, and all individuals 50 and over should be screened,&rdquo; said study author Christine Berg, M.D., chief of NCI&rsquo;s Early Detection Research Group and project officer of the <a href="http://dcp.cancer.gov/plco">Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial</a>.</p>
<p>From 1993 to 2001, a total of 154,900 men and women aged 55 through 74 were randomly assigned to receive flexible sigmoidoscopy screening or usual care as part of the PLCO trial. People in the usual care group (i.e. control group) only received screening if they asked for it, or if their physician recommended it. This large population-based randomized trial was designed to determine the effects of screening on cancer-related mortality. Participants assigned to the flexible sigmoidoscopy group were screened once on entering the study (baseline) and again three years to five years later.&nbsp; The participants were followed for approximately 12 years to collect data on cancer diagnoses and deaths (<a href="http://dcp.cancer.gov/plco/background">additional background on PLCO</a>).</p>

<p>The researchers compared overall colorectal cancer mortality and incidence in the two groups, and also analyzed incidence and mortality according to the location of the cancers that developed. Cancers located from the rectum through a bend in the colon called the splenic flexure (see Figure 3) were defined as distal, and those in the transverse colon to the cecum were defined as proximal.&nbsp; Although flexible sigmoidoscopy examines only the rectum and sigmoid colon, participants with a suspicious finding were referred for a follow-up colonoscopy, in which both the distal and proximal regions of the colon would be examined.</p>
<p>Overall, after an average of nearly 12 years, participants in the screening group had a 21 percent lower incidence of colorectal cancer overall and a 26 percent lower rate of colorectal cancer mortality than participants in the usual care group. This means that, over the course of 10 years, if 1,000 people followed the PLCO protocol of two sigmoidoscopy screenings, there would be approximately three fewer new cases and one fewer death from colorectal cancer than in a comparable group not receiving regular screenings.&nbsp; The incidence of distal colorectal cancer was reduced by 29 percent, and mortality from distal colorectal cancer was reduced by 50 percent, in the screening group.&nbsp; While there was no statistically significant decline in deaths from proximal colorectal cancer, the incidence of proximal colorectal cancer was reduced by 14 percent in the screening group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the second major trial that has shown that sigmoidoscopy is effective in reducing the risk of dying of colorectal cancer.&nbsp; Sigmoidoscopy is less invasive than colonoscopy and carries a lower risk of the colon being perforated, which may make it more acceptable as a screening test to some patients,&rdquo; said Barnett Kramer, M.D., director of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Prevention. &ldquo;There are several <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=14718&amp;sys_revision=61&amp;sys_variantid=690&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="14718" sys_dependentvariantid="690" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="6210661">effective screening tests for colorectal cancer</a>, and the most effective screening test is the one that people choose to take.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Screening by sigmoidoscopy detected 24 percent of the colorectal cancers that were diagnosed in the screening group. Another 60 percent were detected by symptoms or by screening performed outside of the PLCO protocol or were found more than one year after a screening exam&mdash;the cutoff for defining a cancer as screen detected&mdash;in participants who had at least one screening exam, and the remaining 16 percent developed in participants assigned to the screening group who never actually underwent screening. Of the colorectal cancers that were detected by screening, nearly 83 percent were found in the distal colon, whereas distal colorectal cancers made up about 53 percent of the cancers in people in the screening group who were never screened and about 32 percent of cancers in people who underwent screening but whose cancers were not detected by screening. Cancers detected by screening were more likely to be early stage (75 percent were stage I or II) than cancers that weren&rsquo;t detecte <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a> d by screening (51 percent were stage I or II). Screening was associated with reductions in incidence and mortality for all stages of distal colorectal cancer.&nbsp; However, in the proximal colon, reductions in incidence were only seen in stages I, II, and III, and there was no impact on proximal colorectal cancer mortality.</p>
<p>The researchers estimated that if they had used colonoscopy rather than sigmoidoscopy in this study, they would have identified 16 percent more cancers, two-thirds of which would have been proximal cancers.&nbsp; However, they were not able to determine what effect that may have had on proximal colorectal cancer mortality. There has been some controversy about how effective colonoscopy is in decreasing colorectal cancer mortality in different regions of the colon, with some studies suggesting that it is more effective against distal than proximal tumors.&nbsp; Sigmoidoscopy has never been directly compared to colonoscopy in a definitive clinical trial.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=340929">False-positive</a> sigmoidoscopy results were observed in 20 percent of men and 13 percent of women in the screening group, but some of these false positives could have been the result of false-negative colonoscopies done to follow up on suspicious sigmoidoscopy findings. Approximately 22 percent of people in the screening group were sent for follow-up colonoscopies during the screening phase of the trial.</p>

<p>Coffee drinkers were less likely to die from heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections, although the association was not seen for cancer. These results from a large study of older adults were observed after adjustment for the effects of other risk factors on mortality, such as smoking and alcohol consumption. Researchers caution, however, that they can’t be sure whether these associations mean that drinking coffee actually makes people live longer. The results of the study were published in the May 17, 2012, edition of the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>

<p>Neal Freedman, Ph.D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, and his colleagues examined the association between coffee drinking and risk of death in 400,000 U.S. men and women ages 50 to 71 who participated in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Information about coffee intake was collected once by questionnaire at study entry in 1995-1996. The participants were followed until the date they died or Dec. 31, 2008, whichever came first.</p>

<p>The researchers found that the association between coffee and reduction in risk of death increased with the amount of coffee consumed. Relative to men and women who did not drink coffee, those who consumed three or more cups of coffee per day had approximately a 10 percent lower risk of death. Coffee drinking was not associated with cancer mortality among women, but there was a slight and only marginally statistically significant association of heavier coffee intake with increased risk of cancer death among men.</p>

<p>“Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in America, but the association between coffee consumption and risk of death has been unclear. We found coffee consumption to be associated with lower risk of death overall, and of death from a number of different causes,’’ said Freedman. “Although we cannot infer a causal relationship between coffee drinking and lower risk of death, we believe these results do provide some reassurance that coffee drinking does not adversely affect health.”</p>

<p>The investigators caution that coffee intake was assessed by self-report at a single time point and therefore might not reflect long-term patterns of intake. Also, information was not available on how the coffee was prepared (espresso, boiled, filtered, etc.); the researchers consider it possible that preparation methods may affect the levels of any protective components in coffee.</p>

<p>“The mechanism by which coffee protects against risk of death -- if indeed the finding reflects a causal relationship -- is not clear, because coffee contains more than 1,000 compounds that might potentially affect health,’’ said Freedman. ``The most studied compound is caffeine, although our findings were similar in those who reported the majority of their coffee intake to be caffeinated or decaffeinated.”</p>

<li id="que1"><b>What is the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial?</b><br /> The Prostate, Lung, Colorectal and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial is a large, randomized study to determine whether the use of certain screening tests will reduce the risk of dying of those four cancers. In addition to answering questions about the screening tests, the PLCO asked questions about many aspects of the study participants&rsquo; health and collected biospecimens (blood and some tissues) to answer many other questions about cancer.<br /> <br /> Ten screening centers located across the United States enrolled nearly 155,000 people ages 55 to 74 with no previous history of prostate, lung, colorectal, or ovarian cancer.&nbsp; These participants were randomized to either an intervention arm (an organized screening program within the trial) or control arm (which received the usual care from their healthcare providers and which sometimes included screening.)<br /> <br /> PLCO centers began enrolling participants in 1993 and completed enrollment in 2001. Trial participants are unpaid volunteers recruited from the general population in the geographic area of each of the screening centers; there were approximately 78,000 women and 76,000 men enrolled in the study. Participants at each screening center fell into four age groups: 55-59 (33% of participants), 60-64 (31%), 65-69 (23%) and 70-74 (13%) at the beginning of the trial.</li>
<li><b>Why choose these cancers?</b><br /> Together, prostate, lung, colorectal, and ovarian cancers account for almost 40 percent of the cancers diagnosed each year and for 44 percent of cancer deaths.&nbsp; More than 625,000 Americans are expected to be diagnosed with these cancers in 2012 and more than 250,000 will likely die of these diseases.</li>
<li><b>Where were the PLCO Screening Centers located?</b><br /> The 10 PLCO Centers were:
<ul type="disc">
<li>Georgetown University Medical Center, Washington, D.C.</li>
<li>Henry Ford Health System, Detroit</li>
<li>Marshfield Clinical Research Foundation, Marshfield, Wis.</li>
<li>Pacific Health Research and Education Institute, Honolulu</li>
<li>University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, Ala</li>
<li>University of Colorado, Aurora, Colo.</li>
<li>University of Minnesota, Minneapolis</li>
<li>University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh</li>
<li>University of Utah, Salt Lake City, with a satellite in Boise, Idaho</li>
<li>Washington University, St. Louis</li>

<li><b>What cancer screening tests did the participants in the intervention arm receive?</b><br /> Participants included in the intervention arm of the trial received appropriate screening for the PLCO cancers during their first six years on the trial. The tests were:<br /> <br /> <i>For prostate cancer:</i><br /> <b>Digital rectal examination (DRE):</b> An examination in which a doctor inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for abnormalities on the prostate gland located near the rectum.<br /> <br /> <b>Blood test for prostate-specific antigen (PSA):</b> Measurement of a protein made by the prostate gland and found in the blood. PSA blood levels may be higher than normal in men who have prostate cancer, benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), or infection or inflammation of the prostate gland.<br /> <br /> <i>For lung cancer:</i><br /> <b>Single-view chest X-ray:</b>&nbsp; An X-ray of the structures inside the chest. X-rays in this trial were a type of radiation delivered at low doses that can go through the body and onto film, making pictures of areas inside the chest, and can be used to diagnose disease.<br /> <br /> <i>For colorectal cancer:</i><br /> <b>Sigmoidoscopy:</b> Examination of the lower 60 centimeters (about 24 inches) of the colon using a flexible sigmoidoscope, inserted into the rectum. A sigmoidoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing.<br /> <br /> <i>For ovarian cancer:</i><br /> <b>Transvaginal ultrasound (TVU):</b> A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and bladder. An instrument is inserted into the vagina that causes sound waves to bounce off organs inside the pelvis. These sound waves create echoes that are sent to a computer, which creates a picture called a sonogram.<br /> <br /> <b>Blood test for CA-125:</b> Measurement of a substance that may be found in high amounts in the blood of patients with certain types of cancer, including ovarian cancer.</li>
<li><b>How often did the participants get these tests?</b><br /> Men received a digital rectal examination annually for the first 4 years, a PSA blood test annually for 6 years, a chest X-ray annually for 4 years, and a sigmoidoscopy exam upon entry to the trial and a second exam either 3 or 5 years later.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> Women received a chest X-ray annually for 4 years, CA-125 blood test annually for 6 years, transvaginal ultrasound yearly for 4 years, and flexible sigmoidoscopy at the beginning of the trial and either 3 years or 5 years later.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> The participants received follow-up questionnaires via mail for at least 13 years from the time they were randomized.</li>
<li><b>What tests did the control arm participants receive?</b><br /> Participants in the control arm were followed for 13 years after enrollment, but did not receive screening examinations from the PLCO study staff.&nbsp; They were able to receive these and other cancer screening tests on their own, and PLCO study staff estimated how often that occurred from periodic questionnaires administered to a sample of the control participants.</li>
<li id="que7"><b>What are the main findings of the cancer screening part of the PLCO?</b><br /> <b>For colorectal cancer:</b>&nbsp; PLCO results showed that colorectal cancer screening with flexible sigmoidoscopy decreased both the incidence (21%) and death from the disease (26%) over an average of almost 12 years when compared to the usual care group. In other words, for every 1,000 people who would be tested for colorectal cancer like the people in PLCO and followed for 10 years, there would be about 3 fewer cases of colorectal cancer and 1 less death from the disease.&nbsp; This is similar to other tests to screen for colorectal cancer.&nbsp;<br /> <br /> <b>For lung cancer:</b>&nbsp; Participants in the trial who were randomly assigned to receive an annual chest X-ray for 4 consecutive years (only 3 years for never smokers) had nearly the same mortality rate from lung cancer as participants randomly assigned to receive usual care. Only 10 percent of participants were current smokers and 42 percent were former smokers, so many participants were already at low risk of developing lung cancer.&nbsp; When PLCO researchers looked at the subset of about 30,000 patients in the trial who had a strong smoking history, there was a suggestion of a slight reduction in lung cancer mortality risk associated with screening at 6 and 13 years of follow-up. This finding, however, was not statistically significant and may have been due to chance.&nbsp; Chest X-rays have not been shown to be effective as a screening test for lung cancer.<br /> <br /> <b>For ovarian cancer:</b>&nbsp; The PLCO results showed that screening with CA-125 and transvaginal ultrasound increased the number of ovarian cancers diagnosed but did not reduce the number of deaths from these cancers. In addition, the necessary tests to evaluate any abnormal screening tests were associated with complications, some of which were quite serious. Of 3,285 women with false-positive results, 1,080 underwent surgical follow-up; of whom, 163 women experienced at least one serious complication (15%).&nbsp; Combined testing with transvaginal ultrasound and CA-125, as done in PLCO, was not shown to be effective as a screening test for ovarian cancer.<br /> <br /> <b>For prostate cancer:</b>&nbsp; After 13 years of follow up, men who underwent annual prostate cancer screening with PSA testing and DRE had a 12 percent higher incidence of prostate cancer than men in the control group but the same rate of death from the disease. It should be noted that men in the control arm also had PSA screening frequently. No evidence of a mortality benefit was seen overall or in subgroups defined by age, the presence of other illnesses, or pre-trial PSA testing.&nbsp; However, there were harms associated with follow-ups of abnormal screening tests and with treatments.</li>
<li><b>What other information was collected from study participants?</b><br /> Trial data include screening data, baseline and follow-up health and risk factor data, dietary data, health status, and the collection of blood and other biological samples that are supporting molecular, behavioral and risk studies in early detection and etiology.<br /> <br /> All PLCO participants answered questions about sociodemographics, family history, medical history, smoking history, and cancer screening history when they joined the trial. Those in the intervention arm were asked about food consumption, cooking practices, and use of nutritional supplements twice; control arm participants were asked once.&nbsp; In 2006-2007, all PLCO participants were also asked to provide updated information about their medical history and family history and some additional questions about cancer risk factors such as detailed hormone use and smoking information that was not asked at the beginning of the trial.<br /> <br /> Blood samples and tumor samples were collected from participants in the intervention arm; no blood was collected in the control arm, but DNA from cells in the mouth and tumor samples, if cancer arose, were collected for these participants.</li>
<li><b>What studies are being done with the collected information?</b><br /> PLCO investigators have completed and are carrying out hundreds of analyses from study data.&nbsp; Published papers are available via scientific databases and a bibliography can be viewed online at <a href="http://www.parplco.org">http://www.parplco.org</a>.</li>
<li><b>Can investigators who are not already part of the PLCO use this data for research?</b><br /> Yes. The Etiology and Early Marker Study program was created to allow non-PLCO researchers access to specimens and associated information from the trial.&nbsp; Researchers must apply to use the resources and information, and approval of the application does not include funding of the project.&nbsp; For more information, visit <a href="http://prevention.cancer.gov/plco/eems">http://prevention.cancer.gov/plco/eems</a>.&nbsp; The clinical trial data will be available on another web page on or about October 1, 2012.</li>

<li><strong>Is the PLCO completed?</strong><br /> No. There is continued follow-up of participants to strengthen the PLCO as a valuable resource for molecular epidemiologic research as well as provide long-term data on the trial&rsquo;s primary endpoints. There will be at least an additional five years of annual active follow-up for those participants who agreed to collection of additional data, including medication use and medical conditions that are common among older adults; and collection of additional clinical data and tumor tissue for colorectal cancers. This five-year extension will strengthen the trial&rsquo;s ability to clarify the long-term effects of screening on cancer mortality, and provide an opportunity to collect additional exposure data and expand the existing pathology tissue resource within the PLCO. PLCO participant follow-up is being done by a centralized administration rather than by each center.</li>

These markers are indicators that enable doctors to predict the behavior of a patient&#8217;s disease and may aid them in making therapy decisions. The recommendations were originally developed and published simultaneously in five journals in August 2005, to address widespread deficiencies in reporting of such studies, which sometimes has led to inaccurate or irreproducible conclusions. The new article, which offers an extensive explanation of each item on the list of the Reporting Recommendations for Tumor Marker Prognostic Studies (REMARK), appeared concurrently in <i>BMC Medicine</i> and <i>PLoS Medicine</i> today and is written by four of the original authors, including Lisa McShane, Ph.D., Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis, NCI.&#160; The authors hope that the enhanced checklist will provide a better understanding of how various factors, such as specimen selection, biomarker tests, and statistical study design and analysis, can lead to different study results and interpretations and why it is important to provide information to allow readers to fully evaluate and interpret the results. A &#8220;study profile,&#8221; developed by the authors, is recommended as a useful format for presenting the key information that fulfills the checklist reporting elements. Examples of good reporting drawn from the published literature accompany the explanations provided for each of the 20 checklist items. Although the original scope of the REMARK recommendations was primarily the reporting of studies that evaluated the prognostic value of a single marker, the new paper explains that most parts of the recommendations are relevant to studies investigating more than one marker, such as multivariable classification functions or indices.</p><p>This new article not only informs the reader about good reporting but provides a valuable reference related to many issues that should be considered when designing, conducting, and analyzing tumor marker studies. Many of the recommendations also apply to reporting of studies of predictive markers and to prognostic and predictive studies in other diseases. The authors hope that the overall quality of prognostic studies will ultimately improve if researchers give greater forethought to the REMARK checklist items at the time they originally plan their studies.&#160; Improved study quality and more transparent reporting will facilitate comparisons across studies and lead to more informed overviews upon which evidence-based conclusions about the utility of prognostic and predictive markers can be based.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>Children and young adults scanned multiple times by computed tomography (CT), a commonly used diagnostic tool, have a small increased risk of leukemia and brain tumors in the decade following their first scan. These findings are from a study of more than 175,000 children and young adults that was led by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and at the Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University, England. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The researchers emphasize that when a child suffers a major head injury or develops a life-threatening illness, the benefits of clinically appropriate CT scans should outweigh future cancer risks. The results of the study were published online in The Lancet on June 7, 2012.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This cohort study provides the first direct evidence of a link between exposure to radiation from CT and cancer risk in children,&rdquo; said senior investigator Amy Berrington de Gonz&aacute;lez, Ph.D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI. &ldquo;Ours is the first population-based study to capture data on every CT scan to an individual during childhood or young adulthood and then measure the subsequent cancer risk.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the elevation in cancer risk, these two malignancies are relatively rare and the actual number of additional cases caused by radiation exposure from CT scans is small. The most recent (2009) U.S. annual cancer incidence rates for children from birth through age 21 for leukemia and brain cancers are 4.3 per 100,000 and 2.9 per 100,000, respectively. The investigators estimate that for every 10,000 head CT scans performed on children 10 years of age or younger, one case of leukemia and one brain tumor would occur in the decade following the first CT beyond what would have been expected had no CT scans been performed.</p>
<p>CT scans deliver a dose of ionizing radiation to the body part being scanned and to nearby tissues. Even at relatively low doses, ionizing radiation can break the chemical bonds in DNA, causing damage to genes that may increase a person&rsquo;s risk of developing cancer. Children typically face a higher risk of cancer from ionizing radiation exposure than do adults exposed to similar doses.</p>
<p>The investigators obtained CT examination records from radiology departments in hospitals across Britain and linked them to data on cancer diagnoses and deaths. The study included people who underwent CT scans at British National Health Service hospitals from birth to 22 years of age between 1985 and 2002. Information on cancer incidence and mortality from 1985 through 2008 was obtained from the National Health Service Central Registry, a national database of cancer registrations, deaths and emigrations.</p>
<p>Approximately sixty percent of the CT scans were of the head, with similar proportions in males and females. &nbsp;The investigators estimated cumulative doses from the CT scans received by each patient, and assessed the subsequent cancer risk for an average of 10 years after the first CT. The researchers found a clear relationship between the increase in cancer risk and increasing cumulative dose of radiation. A three-fold increase in the risk of brain tumors appeared following a cumulative absorbed dose to the head of 50 to 60 milligray (abbreviated mGy, which is a unit of estimated absorbed dose of ionizing radiation). Similarly, a three-fold increase in the risk of leukemia appeared after the same dose to bone marrow (the part of the body responsible for generating blood cells). The comparison group consisted of individuals who had cumulative doses of less than 5 mGy to the relevant regions of the body.</p>
<p>The absorbed dose from a CT scan depends on factors including age at exposure, sex, examination type, and year of scan. Broadly speaking, &nbsp;two or three CT scans of the head using current scanner settings would be required to yield a dose of 50 to 60 mGy to the brain. The same dose to bone marrow would be produced by five to 10 head CT scans, using current scanner settings for children under age 15.</p>
<p>In countries like the United States and Britain, the use of CT scans in children and adults has increased rapidly since their introduction 30 years ago. Due to efforts by medical societies, government regulators, and CT manufacturers, scans performed on young children in 2012 can have 50 percent &nbsp;lower radiation doses, compared to &nbsp;scans carried out in the 1980s and 1990s, say the investigators. However, the amount of radiation delivered during a single CT scan can still vary greatly and is often up to 10 times higher than that delivered in a conventional X-ray procedure.</p>
<p>The lead author of the study was Mark S. Pearce, Ph.D., Institute of Health and Society, Newcastle University. &ldquo;CT can be highly beneficial for early diagnosis, for clinical decision-making, and for saving lives. However, greater efforts should be made to ensure clinical justification and to keep doses as low as reasonably achievable,&rdquo; said Pearce.</p>

<p>Microbes inhabit just about every part of the human body, living on the skin, in the gut, and up the nose. Sometimes they cause sickness, but most of the time, microorganisms live in harmony with their human hosts, providing vital functions essential for human survival.&nbsp; For the first time, a consortium of researchers organized by the National Institutes of Health has mapped the normal microbial make-up of healthy humans, producing numerous insights and even a few surprises.</p>
<p>Researchers found, for example, that nearly everyone routinely carries pathogens, microorganisms known to cause illnesses. In healthy individuals, however, pathogens cause no disease; they simply coexist with their host and the rest of the human microbiome, the collection of all microorganisms living in the human body. Researchers must now figure out why some pathogens turn deadly and under what conditions, likely revising current concepts of how microorganisms cause disease.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In a series of coordinated scientific reports published on June 14, 2012, in Nature and several journals in the Public Library of Science (PLoS), some 200 members of the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) Consortium from nearly 80 universities and scientific institutions report on five years of research. HMP has received $153 million since its launch in fiscal year 2007 from the NIH Common Fund, which invests in high-impact, innovative, trans-NIH research. Individual NIH institutes and centers have provided an additional $20 million in co-funding for HMP consortium research.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like 15<sup>th</sup> century explorers describing the outline of a new continent, HMP researchers employed a new technological strategy to define, for the first time, the normal microbial makeup of the human body,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. &ldquo;HMP created a remarkable reference database by using genome sequencing techniques to detect microbes in healthy volunteers. This lays the foundation for accelerating infectious disease research previously impossible without this community resource.&rdquo;</p>
<p>METHODS AND RESULTS</p>
<p>The human body contains trillions of microorganisms&mdash;outnumbering human cells by 10 to 1. Because of their small size, however, microorganisms make up only about 1 to 3 percent of the body's mass (in a 200-pound adult, that&rsquo;s 2 to 6 pounds of bacteria), but play a vital role in human health.</p>
<p>To define the normal human microbiome, HMP researchers sampled 242 healthy U.S. volunteers (129 male, 113 female), collecting tissues from 15 body sites in men and 18 body sites in women. Researchers collected up to three samples from each volunteer at sites such as the mouth, nose, skin (two behind each ear and each inner elbow), and lower intestine (stool), and three vaginal sites in women; each body site can be inhabited by organisms as different as those in the Amazon Rainforest and the Sahara Desert.</p>
<p>Historically, doctors studied microorganisms in their patients by isolating pathogens and growing them in culture. This painstaking process typically identifies only a few microbial species, as they are hard to grow in the laboratory. In HMP, researchers purified all human and microbial DNA in each of more than 5,000 samples and analyzed them with DNA sequencing machines. &nbsp;Using computers, researchers sorted through the 3.5 terabases of genome sequence data to identify specific genetic signals found only in bacteria &ndash; the variable genes of bacterial ribosomal RNA called 16S rRNA. Bacterial ribosomal RNA helps form the cellular structures that manufacture protein and can identify the presence of different microbial species.</p>
<p>Focusing on this microbial signature allowed HMP researchers to ignore the human genome sequences and analyze only the bacterial DNA. In addition, metagenomic sequencing, or sequencing all of the DNA in a microbial community, allowed the researchers to study the metabolic capabilities encoded in the genes of these microbial communities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Recently developed genome sequencing methods now provide a powerful lens for looking at the human microbiome,&rdquo; said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., director of the National Human Genome Research Institute, which managed HMP for NIH. &ldquo;The astonishing drop in the cost of sequencing DNA has made possible the kind of large survey performed by the Human Microbiome Project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Where doctors had previously isolated only a few hundred bacterial species from the body, HMP researchers now calculate that more than 10,000 microbial species occupy the human ecosystem. Moreover, researchers calculate that they have identified between 81 and 99 percent of all microorganismal genera in healthy adults.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have defined the boundaries of normal microbial variation in humans,&rdquo; said James M. Anderson, M.D., Ph.D., director of the NIH Division of Program Coordination, Planning and Strategic Initiatives, which includes the NIH Common Fund.&nbsp; &ldquo;We now have a very good idea of what is normal for a healthy Western population and are beginning to learn how changes in the microbiome correlate with physiology and disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>HMP researchers also reported that this plethora of microbes contribute more genes responsible for human survival than humans contribute. Where the human genome carries some 22,000 protein-coding genes, researchers estimate that the human microbiome contributes some 8 million unique protein-coding genes or 360 times more bacterial genes than human genes.</p>
<p>This bacterial genomic contribution is critical for human survival. Genes carried by bacteria in the gastro-intestinal tract, for example, allow humans to digest foods and absorb nutrients that otherwise would be unavailable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humans don&rsquo;t have all the enzymes we need to digest our own diet,&rdquo; said Lita Proctor, Ph.D., NHGRI&rsquo;s HMP program manager. &ldquo;Microbes in the gut break down many of the proteins, lipids and carbohydrates in our diet into nutrients that we can then absorb. Moreover, the microbes produce beneficial compounds, like vitamins and anti-inflammatories that our genome cannot produce.&rdquo; Anti-inflammatories are compounds that regulate some of the immune system&rsquo;s response to disease, such as swelling.</p>
<p>Researchers were surprised to discover that the distribution of microbial metabolic activities matters more than the species of microbes providing them. &nbsp;In the healthy gut, for example, there will always be a population of bacteria needed to help digest fats, but it may not always be the same bacterial species carrying out this job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears that bacteria can pinch hit for each other,&rdquo; said Curtis Huttenhower, Ph.D., of Harvard School of Public Health and lead co-author for one of the HMP papers in Nature. &ldquo;It matters whether the metabolic function is present, not which microbial species provides it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Moreover, the components of the human microbiome clearly change over time. When a patient is sick or takes antibiotics, the species that makeup of the microbiome may shift substantially as one bacterial species or another is affected.&nbsp; Eventually, however, the microbiome returns to a state of equilibrium, even if the previous composition of bacterial types does not.</p>
<p>CLINICAL APPLICATIONS</p>
<p>As a part of HMP, NIH funded a number of studies to look for associations of the microbiome with diseases and several PLoS papers include medical results. For example, researchers at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston compared changes in the vaginal microbiome of 24 pregnant women with 60 women who were not pregnant and found that the vaginal microbiome undergoes a dramatic shift in bacterial species in preparation for birth, principally characterized by decreased species diversity. A newborn is a bacterial sponge as it populates its own microbiome after leaving the sterile womb; passage through the birth canal gives the baby its first dose of microbes, so it may not be surprising that the vaginal microbiome evolved to make it a healthy passage.</p>
<p>Researchers at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis examined the nasal microbiome of children with unexplained fevers, a common problem in children under 3 years of age. Nasal samples from the feverish children contained up to five-fold more viral DNA than children without fever, and the viral DNA was from a wider range of species.&nbsp; Previous studies show that viruses have ideal temperature ranges in which to reproduce. Fevers are part of the body&rsquo;s defense against pathogenic viruses, so rapid tests for viral load may help children avoid inappropriate treatment with antibiotics that do not kill the viruses but may harm the child&rsquo;s healthy microbiome.</p>
<p>These are among the earliest clinical studies using microbiome data to study its role in specific illnesses. NIH has funded many more medical studies using HMP data and techniques, including the role of the gut microbiome in Crohn&rsquo;s disease, ulcerative colitis and esophageal cancer; skin microbiome in psoriasis, atopic dermatitis and immunodeficiency; urogenital microbiome in reproductive and sexual history and circumcision; and a number of childhood disorders, including pediatric abdominal pain, intestinal inflammation, and a severe condition in premature infants in which the intestine actually dies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enabling disease-specific studies is the whole point of the Human Microbiome Project,&rdquo; said Barbara Meth&eacute;, Ph.D., of the J. Craig Venter Institute, Rockville, MD, and lead co-author of the Nature paper on the framework for current and future human microbiome research. &ldquo;Now that we understand what the normal human microbiome looks like, we should be able to understand how changes in the microbiome are associated with, or even cause, illnesses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NIH Common Fund also invested in a series of studies to evaluate the ethical, legal and social implications of microbiome research. While the results of these studies are yet to be published, a number of important issues already have been identified, ranging from how products designed to manipulate the microbiome -- such as probiotic concoctions that include live microorganism believed to benefit the body -- might be regulated, to whether individuals should begin to consider storing their microbiome while healthy.</p>
<p>After NIH launched HMP in December 2007, the International Human Microbiome Consortium formed in 2008 to represent funding organizations, including NIH, and scientists from around the world interested in studying the human microbiome. The consortium has coordinated research to avoid duplication of effort and insured rapid release of molecular and clinical data sets. It also has developed common data quality standards and tools to share research results.</p>
<p>As with other large-scale collaborative efforts, NIH ensured that the research community could freely access HMP data through public databases, such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information (<a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj/43021?report=HMP">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj/43021?report=HMP</a>), part of the National Library of Medicine, and at the HMP Data Analysis and Coordinating Center (<a href="http://www.hmpdacc.org/">http://www.hmpdacc.org/</a>).</p>
<p>The Human Microbiome Project is managed by National Human Genome Research Institute, in partnership with the NIH Office of the Director, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, National Cancer Institute, National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, and National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, all part of NIH.</p>

<p>In a study of non-metal miners in the United States, federal government scientists reported that heavy exposure to diesel exhaust increased risk of death from lung cancer. The study was carried out by researchers from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, both parts of HHS. The results were distributed in two papers on March 2, 2012, from the Journal of the National Cancer Institute&nbsp;and&nbsp;they will be posted to the JNCI website on March 5, 2012.</p>
<p>The research, all part of the Diesel Exhaust in Miners Study, was designed to evaluate cancer risk from diesel exhaust, particularly as it may relate to lung cancer, among 12,315 workers at eight non-metal mining facilities. The facilities were located in Missouri (1 limestone mine), New Mexico (3 potash mines), Ohio (1 salt mine), and Wyoming (3 trona mines, which process an ore used in soda ash).</p>
<p>The investigators selected underground mines for their study setting because the heavy equipment used in these mines frequently runs on diesel fuel. In the fairly enclosed environments of these mines, exhaust builds up in the air to levels considerably higher than those found in other occupational settings&mdash;like trucking depots or shipyards&mdash;and many times higher than the air inhaled by the general population. The investigators selected only non-metal mines because of their characteristically low levels of other exposures that may be related to lung cancer risk, such as radon, silica, and asbestos.</p>

<p>Health outcomes associated with exposure to diesel exhaust were reported in two complementary papers. The first documented the risk of dying from any cause, with an emphasis on lung cancer, using data from the full study population (the cohort study). The second (the case-control study) reported on the lung cancer deaths in the cohort study. In the case-control study, investigators obtained detailed information on lung cancer risk factors, including smoking, employment in other high-risk jobs, and history of other respiratory diseases. Both papers reported an exposure-response relationship with higher risks at increased exposure levels.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was vitally important to undertake a large study of diesel exhaust and lung cancer based on a quantitative assessment of historical exposure, taking into account smoking and other potentially relevant factors in order to estimate lung cancer risk,&rdquo; said lead author of the case-control study, Debra T. Silverman, Sc.D., chief of the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG) at NCI.</p>
<p>To quantify exposure for each worker, the investigators collected thousands of measurements of constituents of diesel exhaust in the air at each mine and combined those data with historical exposure information. Importantly, diesel exhaust levels were quantified by measurements and estimates of one of its key components, respirable elemental carbon, which is considered the best index of diesel exhaust in underground mining. The same exposure measurements were used in both the cohort and case-control analyses. The methods for this effort were published previously in four papers in the Annals of Occupational Hygiene in 2010. A fifth paper&mdash;an evaluation of the exposure assessment&mdash;was published March 2012 in the same journal.</p>
<p>Michael D. Attfield, Ph.D., who led the cohort study while at NIOSH, found that the risk of lung cancer among heavily exposed underground workers was five times the risk observed among workers in the lowest exposure category.</p>
<p>Turning to the case-control study, it confirmed the lung cancer findings from the cohort study. When the investigators took into account smoking and other lung cancer risk factors, the data showed a three-fold risk of lung cancer death overall and about a five-fold risk for heavily exposed underground workers, which is consistent with the cohort analysis.</p>
<p>For never smokers, risk of lung cancer death increased with increasing diesel exhaust exposure. &ldquo;These data are especially revealing as they show the effect of diesel exhaust in the absence of smoking,&rdquo; said Silverman. Although based on small numbers, non-smokers with the highest level of diesel exposure were seven times more likely to die from lung cancer than non-smokers in the lowest exposure category.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This landmark study has informed on the lung cancer risks for underground mine workers, but the findings suggest that the risks may extend to other workers exposed to diesel exhaust in the United States and abroad, and to people living in urban areas where diesel exhaust levels are elevated,&rdquo; said Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., M.D., director, DCEG.</p>

<p>Scientists have uncovered a number of molecular signatures in Burkitt lymphoma, including unique genetic alterations that promote cell survival, that are not found in other lymphomas. These findings provide the first genetic evidence that Burkitt lymphoma is a cancer fundamentally distinct from other types of lymphoma. The researchers, from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and their collaborators, identified mutated genes and altered pathways that might be used as targets for the development of new pharmaceuticals or the application of existing drugs for people with Burkitt lymphoma. The study was published online Aug. 12, 2012, in the journal Nature.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Burkitt lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and three clinical subtypes of this disease have been recognized. In the United States, a sporadic subtype affects all ages but is most frequent in children. The EBV-associated endemic subtype (associated with the Epstein-Barr virus) is most common among children in Africa. &nbsp;The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) predisposes to a third Burkitt lymphoma subtype.</p>

</div>
<p>Past studies by the research team, led by Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., of NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research, established that Burkitt lymphoma can be readily distinguished from another type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, diffuse large-B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), based on signatures of gene activity. While it was known that the MYC tumor promoting gene is always active in Burkitt lymphoma, other genetic changes that cause this lymphoma were largely unknown.</p>
<p>In this study, the scientists employed methods known as RNA resequencing and RNA interference (RNAi) to identify new genes and pathways that might cooperate with MYC in the early stages of Burkitt lymphoma. RNA resequencing enabled the researchers to find additional mutated genes in Burkitt lymphoma cells, and RNAi -- in which the expression of individual genes can be silenced (knocked down or made inoperative) -- helped them identify genes and pathways that are critical for cell proliferation and survival.</p>
<p>The researchers performed RNA resequencing in biopsy samples from 28 patients with Burkitt lymphoma and from 13 different Burkitt lymphoma cell lines and re-analyzed previously published RNA sequencing data from 80 DLBCL biopsies.&nbsp; To confirm their genetic findings, they used an additional 111 biopsies and cell lines from sporadic, endemic and HIV-associated Burkitt lymphoma as well as 186 DLBCL biopsies.</p>
<p>In addition to finding that, as expected, MYC was highly mutated in Burkitt lymphoma, the researchers identified mutations in many other genes not previously implicated in this cancer, many of which were rarely, if ever, mutated in DLBCL. Conversely, they found genes that are frequently mutated in DLBCL but not in Burkitt lymphoma, showing that these lymphomas use fundamentally different mechanisms to become cancerous.</p>
<p>Among the most commonly mutated genes in Burkitt lymphoma was TCF3, encoding a crucial regulator of normal B-cell function.&nbsp; B-cells are white blood cells that produce antibodies and are important to immunity. They are also the cells of origin of Burkitt lymphoma and DLBCL.&nbsp; Even more prevalent than TCF3 were mutations found in the ID3 gene which encodes a protein that blocks TCF3 action.&nbsp; Together, these genes were mutated in almost 70 percent of the Burkitt lymphoma samples.&nbsp; Most of these mutations interfered with the ability of ID3 to inhibit TCF3, allowing TCF3 to alter the activity of hundreds of genes in Burkitt lymphoma cells.&nbsp; In fact, the researchers found that Burkitt lymphoma cell lines, but not DLBCL cell lines, died when TCF3 was turned off by RNAi.</p>
<p>The discovery of TCF3 and ID3 mutations in Burkitt led the researchers to identify a potent cell survival pathway that might be attacked therapeutically.&nbsp; They showed that TCF3 promotes the survival of malignant lymphoma cells by amplifying signals from the B-cell receptor, a protein complex that spans the outer membrane of B-cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The B-cell receptor allows normal B cells to sense foreign molecules in their vicinity, triggering their proliferation and survival as they mount an immune response. One of the signaling pathways that is activated by the B-cell receptor is called the PI(3) kinase pathway. A kinase is an enzyme that transmits signals and helps control complex processes in cells. The PI(3) kinase pathway is perhaps the most frequently activated signaling pathway in human cancer and activation of this pathway promotes cancer cell survival. Consequently, a considerable drug development effort is underway to identify PI(3) kinase pathway inhibitors, said Staudt, but no such inhibitor has yet been clinically tested in patients with Burkitt lymphoma.</p>
<p>Another gene, CCND3<i>,</i> was mutated in 38 percent of the Burkitt lymphoma cell samples. CCND3 is activated by TCF3 and encodes a protein (cyclin D3) that interacts with a kinase called CDK6 in Burkitt lymphoma cells to promote cell cycle progression. The authors found that drugs that inhibit CDK6 caused Burkitt lymphoma cells to arrest and die, indicating that CDK6 may be another important target for the development of therapies for this cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our research suggests a number of targeted therapies that might be less toxic than the high-dose chemotherapy that is typically given to patients with Burkitt lymphoma in the U.S., even though they have cure rates approaching 90 percent,&rdquo; said Staudt.&nbsp; &ldquo;Such targeted therapies might also help children in Africa with Burkitt lymphoma, who only have cure rates of about 50 percent because intensive chemotherapy cannot be delivered safely in that setting.&rdquo;</p>

High mammographic density appears as extensive white areas on an X-ray.&#160; Glandular and connective tissue, together known as fibroglandular tissue, block the passage of X-rays to a greater extent than fatty tissue. Breasts with a greater proportion of fibroglandular tissue are said, therefore, to be mammographically denser. For most women, mammographic breast density decreases as they get older, reflecting gradual replacement of fibroglandular tissue by fatty tissue during the normal aging process.</p><p>Although high mammographic breast density is a well-established risk factor for developing breast cancer, it was unclear prior to this study whether breast density is also associated with the risk of death among women diagnosed with breast cancer. To address this question the scientists analyzed data from the BCSC, a population-based registry of breast imaging facilities in the United States. The scientists restricted their analysis to five BCSC registries that consistently collect data on body mass index (BMI). BMI is a poor prognostic factor for breast cancer that is inversely related to breast density and therefore might potentially affect associations between density and breast cancer death.</p><p>Patients included in the study were 30 years or older at breast cancer diagnosis, which occurred primarily between January 1996 and December 2005. The patients were followed, on average, for 6.6 years, at which time 1,795 deaths were reported, including 889 from breast cancer and 810 from other causes. To analyze breast density, the scientists used the most widely available measure of breast density currently in clinical use, a score known as the Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System score, which is given by a radiologist based on visual review of a mammogram. Data on tumor characteristics and other personal and health factors were also analyzed.</p><p>The analysis of mammographic density showed that breast cancer patients with high-density breasts did not have a higher risk of death from breast cancer than patients with lower density breasts, after adjusting for other health factors and tumor characteristics. The lack of an association between mammographic breast density and breast cancer death is consistent with findings from an earlier, smaller study that examined this association.</p><p>This study also found an increase in risk of breast cancer death associated with lower breast density among specific subgroups, particularly breast cancer patients who are obese. The authors speculate that one possible explanation for the increased risk associated with low breast density among some subgroups is that breasts with a higher percentage of fat may provide a tumor microenvironment that facilitates cancer growth and progression.&#160;</p><p>&quot;Overall, it was reassuring to find that high mammographic breast density, one of the strongest risk factors for breast cancer, was not related to risk of death from breast cancer or death from any cause among breast cancer patients,&quot; said Gierach. &quot;Given that we identified subsets of women with breast cancer for whom low density was associated with poor prognoses, our findings underscore the need for an improved understanding of the biological components that are responsible for breast density.&quot;</p><p style=" text-align: left;">To view an interview with a radiologist about digital mammography and the challenges posed by dense breasts, please visit: <a href="http://benchmarks.cancer.gov/2012/08/zuurbier-discusses-digital-mammography-and-dense-breasts/">http://benchmarks.cancer.gov/2012/08/zuurbier-discusses-digital-mammography-and-dense-breasts/</a></p><p align="center"># # #</p><p align="center">&#160;</p><p><b>Reference:</b> Gierach GL, et al.

The studies found that these alterations in chromosomes appear to increase with age, particularly after the age of 50, and may be associated with an increased risk for cancer. These studies were conducted by two consortia, one led by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and one by Gene Environment Association Studies (GENEVA) which is sponsored by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI).&#160; NCI and NHGRI are both parts of the National Institutes of Health. The results of the studies were published online May 6, 2012, in Nature Genetics.</p><p>Mosaicism, the type of structural abnormality in chromosomes that is described in these studies, results from a DNA alteration that is present in some of the body&#39;s cells but not in others. A person with mosaicism has a mixture of normal and mutated cells.</p><p>&#8220;These two studies provide large population-based evidence that genetic mosaicism increases with age and could be a risk factor for cancer. This last point raises an important issue with respect to the stability of a person&#8217;s genome and suggests that detection of genetic mosaicism could be an early marker for detecting cancer, or perhaps other chronic diseases,&#8221; said Stephen Chanock, M.D., co-author and chief, Laboratory of Translational Genomics, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI.</p><p>Scientists began observing an unexpected frequency of structural abnormalities in chromosomes during quality control checks of data from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) conducted in the GENEVA consortium and similar programs at NCI.&#160; These studies involve comparing hundreds of thousands of common differences across individual patients&#8217; DNA to see if any of those variants are associated with a known trait, such as cancer. &#160;At first, these abnormalities were thought to be errors or outcomes of laboratory procedures. But they were found consistently at a low frequency, so the scientists wondered with what frequency these structural abnormalities occurred in the general population.</p><p>Previously, NCI investigators had reported that genetic mosaicism was observed in a population-based study in Spain. Since there were no accurate estimates of the frequency of mosaicism in the general population, NCI investigators looked at large mosaic chromosomal abnormalities in 31,717 cancer cases and 26,136 cancer-free controls from 13 GWAS. &#160;Similar analyses were conducted by investigators at the University of Washington, Seattle, collaborating with NHGRI and NCI investigators in the GENEVA consortium.&#160; The 16 GENEVA studies included participants of all ages and have been focused on several different chronic diseases, but only a small proportion of these studies focused on cancer as the primary outcome.</p><p>The NCI-led study observed that genetic mosaic abnormalities were more frequent in individuals with solid tumors (0.97 percent vs. 0.74 percent in cancer-free individuals). The NCI study also observed mosaic chromosomal abnormalities in slightly less than 1 percent of the study participants, but noted that the frequency of detectable genetic mosaicism increased with age. This was consistent with GENEVA results that found genetic mosaicism increased in those over the age of 50.</p><p>The GENEVA investigators studied blood samples of over 50,000 participants and identified genetic mosaicism abnormalities in 404 of the participants, most of who were over age 50. They found genetic mosaicism abnormalities in 0.2 percent of people younger than age 30. From age 30 to age 50, mosaicism frequency rose; it increased sharply over age 60, with up to a 2.5 percent frequency above age 75. &#160;Past analyses suggest that mosaic abnormalities are often detectable in later life because they arise and accumulate over time and/or because the descendants of mosaic cells expand in numbers throughout the body and are more readily detected at older ages, the scientists say.</p><p>&#8220;Repeated collection of blood samples may play a major role in helping determine how genetic mosaicism rises quickly at older ages. This is supported by observation of our only GENEVA subject who was sampled twice -- once at age 66 and again at age 72. While no mosaic abnormalities where detected in the earlier sample, the later sample contained five mosaic abnormalities, each on a different chromosome,&#8221; said Teri Manolio, M.D., Ph.D., director, Office of Population Genomics, NHGRI .</p><p>In both studies, scientists observed an increase in the detection of genetic mosaicism in patients with hematological cancers (leukemia, lymphoma, and myeloma), for which DNA was collected at least one year prior to diagnosis, compared to cancer-free individuals. Results from the NCI study showed that risk of leukemia was also substantially higher among people with these chromosomal alterations while the GENEVA study showed that the risk of acquiring a hematological cancer diagnosis was 10 times higher for people who had mosaic chromosomal abnormalities. The results of both studies suggest that mosaicism, observed in older people, may be an asymptomatic condition -- not often causing overt illness -- that may predispose them to hematological cancer. However, GENEVA and NCI scientists stress that the event numbers analyzed are small, and additional studies are needed across a broader diversity of populations to establish the clinical significance of these findings.</p><p><a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>NIH scientists say these findings will have important implications for the design and analysis of molecular studies of cancer, as well as ongoing studies looking at the characterization of cancer genomes, such as NIH&#8217;s The Cancer Genome Atlas and the International Cancer Genome Consortium.</p><p>NIH scientists recommended that additional analyses be conducted in groups of currently healthy people so that investigators may follow them over time for health outcomes. They also said that researchers may want to collect multiple DNA samples over many years to explore disease and treatment effects. Additional studies with subjects, sampled at multiple ages, will be invaluable in the evaluation of the origin and stability of mosaic abnormalities.</p><p style=" text-align: center;">###</p><p><b>References:</b></p><ol><li>Jacobs KB, et al.

<p>More than 400 leading experts in cancer survivorship convened today for a conference, <i>Cancer Survivorship Research: Translating Science to Care</i>, to focus on such current concerns as how obesity might not have the same effects on all cancer survivors, and the substantial and increasing economic burden of cancer survivorship in the United States.</p>
<p>Since 2002, the Biennial Cancer Survivorship Research Conference has brought together investigators and clinicians involved in cancer survivorship research. The conference is jointly sponsored by the American Cancer Society&rsquo;s Behavioral Research Center, the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s Office of Cancer Survivorship, the Lance Armstrong Foundation, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>
<p>Obesity continues to be a major public health concern, and the effects of obesity on cancer survivors specifically will be the focus of one session. &nbsp;Population studies will be discussed that demonstrate that obesity might not have the same effects on all survivors, and new animal studies will be presented that are informing behavior change interventions for survivors who need them most.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experts also will explore resilience, or the ability to cope effectively with stress and adversity. Cancer survivorship research has attempted to document and design interventions to address the physical and psychosocial effects of cancer that can disrupt survivors&rsquo; health and well-being. This session will highlight recent scientific findings on resilience and growth after cancer and will present a psychosocial program to enhance resilience and well-being among cancer survivors.</p>
<p>The economic burden of cancer survivorship in the United States is substantial and is expected to increase significantly in the future.&nbsp; One session, titled Economic Issues in Cancer Survivorship, <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>will provide an overview of recent research in health care costs, employment patterns, health insurance, and access to health care in cancer survivors.&nbsp; Leading scientists will identify research gaps and potentially modifiable issues for research and policy interventions to improve outcomes for cancer survivors and their families.</p>
<p>This year&rsquo;s conference again includes a survivor advocate program, which provides travel scholarships for 20 advocates to attend the conference, to learn first-hand about key research in cancer survivorship and to interact with other advocate leaders and survivorship researchers. Program participants were selected on the basis of their research advocacy experience, the potential impact conference attendance would have on their future advocacy work, and the strength of their proposed use of tools from the conference for community education.</p>

Its data integration capacities are easier, faster, and more flexible than other available methods, and these tools can be adapted for use with other collections of data. <p>Researchers looking at a particular drug can use the tools to access data from previous experiments done on that drug and analyze how the drug relates to other drugs and various gene profiles. &#160;As a case example for this study, the researchers compared drug activity levels and gene expression patterns from previous research to identify an investigational compound, called NSC732298, which is not currently being studied for colon cancer, but could be a potential therapy for the disease based on a CellMiner gene-drug match. &#160;In the same exercise, the researchers were able to identify that a second investigational drug that is being tested for colon cancer, called selumetinib, might also be effective against melanoma.</p><p>&#8220;We&#8217;re looking forward to seeing how other people are going to use this tool to look at gene co-regulation, regulation of gene expression, and the relationship between gene expression and cancer,&#8221; said Pommier.</p><p>This work was supported by NCI&#8217;s Center for Cancer Research and Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis under intramural project number ZIA BC 006150.</p><p align="center">###</p><p>NCI leads the National Cancer Program and the NIH effort to dramatically reduce the burden of cancer and improve the lives of cancer patients and their families, through research into prevention and cancer biology, the development of new interventions, and the training and mentoring of new researchers. &#160;For more information about cancer, please visit the NCI Web site at <a href="http://www.cancer.gov">www.cancer.gov</a> or call NCI&#39;s Cancer Information Service at 1-800-4-CANCER (1-800-422-6237).</p><p><strong>About the National Institutes of Health (NIH):</strong> NIH, the nation&#39;s medical research agency, includes 27 Institutes and Centers and is a component of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

<p><i>The Cancer Genome Atlas, supported by NIH, finds shared genomic features that could aid treatments</i></p>
<p>One subtype of breast cancer shares many genetic features with high-grade serous ovarian cancer, a cancer that is very difficult to treat, according to researchers supported by the National Institutes of Health. The findings suggest that the two cancers are of similar molecular origin, which may facilitate the comparison of therapeutic data for subtypes of breast and ovarian cancers.</p>
<p>The researchers, using data generated as part of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), described new insights into the four standard molecular subtypes based on a comprehensive characterization of samples from 825 breast cancer patients.</p>
<p>The study, a collaborative effort funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both part of NIH, was published online Sept. 23, 2012, and in print Oct. 4, 2012, in the journal Nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TCGA&rsquo;s comprehensive characterization of their high-quality samples allows researchers an unprecedented look at these breast cancer subgroups,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.</p>

</div>
<p>Analyses of genomic data have confirmed that there are four primary subtypes of breast cancer, each with its own biology and survival outlooks. &nbsp;These TCGA findings are based on a large number of breast cancer specimens that capture a complete view of the genomic alterations. &nbsp;The four groups are called intrinsic subtypes of breast cancer: HER2-enriched (HER2E), Luminal A (LumA), Luminal B (LumB) and Basal-like. &nbsp;A fifth type, called Normal-like, was observed, but because of small numbers (only eight specimens) the researchers were unable to rigorously study it.</p>
<p>The TCGA Research Network uncovered marked genomic similarities between the Basal-like subtype and serous ovarian cancer. The mutation spectrum, or types and frequencies of genomic mutations, were largely the same in both cancer types. Further analyses identified several additional common genomic features, such as gene mutation frequency, suggesting that diverse genomic aberrations can converge into a limited number of cancer subtypes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Computational analyses show that Basal-like breast cancer and serous ovarian cancer might both be susceptible to agents that inhibit blood vessel growth, cutting off the blood supply to the tumor, as well as to compounds that target DNA repair, which include chemotherapy drugs such as cisplatin. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Basal-like subgroup has also been called Triple Negative Breast Cancer because many, though not all, Basal-like tumors are negative when tested for three receptors: the estrogen receptor, the progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These receptors can trigger potent cell growth responses and act like a nametag, identifying the cell to the environment. The absence of these receptors means that treatments that target them will most likely be ineffective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The molecular similarity of one of the principal subtypes of breast cancer to that found in ovarian cancer gives us additional leverage to compare treatments and outcomes across these two cancers,&rdquo; noted Harold Varmus, M.D., NCI director. &nbsp;&ldquo;This treasure trove of genetic information will need to be examined in great detail to identify how we can use it functionally and clinically.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the World Health Organization, there are approximately 1.3 million new cases of breast cancer and 450,000 deaths worldwide annually. Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women. The majority of cases are sporadic, meaning there is not a family history of breast cancer, as opposed to genetic, where genes predispose a person to the disease. &nbsp;Men can also develop breast cancer, but it accounts for less than 1 percent of breast cancer cases.</p>
<p>Breast cancer tumors that have the HER2 receptor are called HER2-positive, and those that don't are called HER2-negative. When researchers analyzed the genomic findings from tumors determined to be HER2-positive by standard cellular tests, they found that only half of the samples could be characterized as belonging to the HER2E subtype. The other half were characterized as Luminal subtypes, suggesting that there are at least two types of clinically defined HER2-positive tumors. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In general, the Luminal subtypes had the lowest overall mutation rate, but by contrast, had the largest number of genes observed to be significantly mutated. This suggests that each of the genes identified as significantly mutated in the Luminal subtypes is more likely to be important in fueling cancer progression. The Luminal subtypes are characterized by the specific expression signature of multiple so-called transcription-factor genes, including ESR1, GATA3, FOXA1, XBP1 and cMYB. These genes have a complex interaction, cooperating in an orchestrated series of activations. GATA3 and FOXA1 are frequently mutated, but those mutations are mutually exclusive, meaning that mutations were observed in either GATA3 or FOXA1 but never in both. However, ERS1 and XBP1 are highly expressed but infrequently mutated.</p>
<p>The scale of the TCGA program allows researchers to perform the integrative analyses that detect these complex patterns of genomic changes and interactions. This close inspection of the cancer genome has led to a deeper understanding of the mutations essential for cancer progression, and several new candidates were identified in this study. The authors hope that discovery of these mutations will be a crucial step toward improving breast cancer therapies.</p>
<p>This publication focuses on the discoveries made through a combined analysis involving data from 825 breast cancer cases, which are freely available in the TCGA Data Portal, with several hundred more cases to come.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The data generated by the TCGA program comprise a vast resource that investigators will be analyzing for years to come. &nbsp;The resource of information about breast cancer genomes will undoubtedly fuel myriad discoveries by the cancer research community,&rdquo; said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., NHGRI director.</p>

MYC is not a power switch but a universal amplifier,&#8221; said co-lead study author Keji Zhao, Ph.D., director of the Systems Biology Center at the NIH&#8217;s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI). &#8220;This discovery offers a unifying idea of how and why abnormal levels of MYC are found in so many different cancer types, such as breast cancer, lung cancer, and several blood cancers.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;MYC is much like the volume control of a music player,&#8221; added co-lead David Levens, M.D., Ph.D., a senior investigator in the Laboratory of Pathology at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), also part of NIH. &#8220;If you&#8217;re listening to opera, for example, adding more MYC will make the opera louder, but it won&#8217;t change the program to rap. And if you have only silence, MYC will just give you more silence.&#8221;</p><p>Both researchers noted that this new understanding of MYC function could influence future treatment efforts for MYC-associated tumors. They suggest that trying to limit MYC activity, or turning down the volume just the right amount, would be a better strategy than using targeted chemotherapy to try to eliminate all MYC activity.</p><p>MYC aids in cell activation, a process in which cells mature and divide quickly. During an immune response, for example, white blood cells are activated to help fight infections. If activation isn&#8217;t properly regulated, then cells can start growing out of control and result in cancer. Researchers have known that abnormally high levels of MYC can lead to cancer, but until now, no one had been able to explain how it can lead to so many different cancers.</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5460542" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="2090" sys_dependentid="434365">

  	</div><p>Zhao, Levens, and their colleagues used a specially designed fluorescent protein that allowed them to track MYC in white blood cells in a lab dish. They chose white blood cells, specifically B cells and T cells that fight infections, because they are frequently affected by abnormal MYC and can transform into lymphoma and myeloma cells.</p><p>The team exposed the B and T cells to foreign toxins to stimulate an immune response and activate the fluorescent MYC. The researchers could then examine the cells at different time points and see which genes the MYC proteins seemed to affect.</p><p>The analysis revealed that MYC didn&#39;t prefer any specific type of gene. Instead, MYC proteins were present at nearly every gene that was already expressed, or turned on. The researchers also noticed that the amount of MYC at each expressed gene correlated with how active that gene was prior to immune stimulation. The more active the gene, the more MYC gathered there. MYC appeared to amplify productivity relative to the initial expression levels where it gave a small boost to genes with low activity and a big boost to genes with high activity.</p><p>The researchers validated the idea of MYC as a universal amplifier by developing a set of B cells that did not produce functional MYC.

Anal cancer is rare, with an estimated 6,230 cases in 2012 but incidence rates in the U.S. have risen steadily over the past several decades.&#160; This new study documents that among men, half of this increase is explained by cases occurring in those who are HIV-positive. For the most recent period studied, 28 percent of men with anal cancer were infected with HIV. In contrast, very few females with anal cancer were HIV-infected&#8212;just 1 percent. Anal cancer is caused primarily by persistent infection with the human papillomavirus (HPV).&#160;</p><p>HIV causes immunosuppression, which may impair the body&#8217;s ability to control HPV. To determine the impact HIV has had on anal cancer incidence in the U.S., Meredith S. Shiels, Ph.D., and Eric A. Engels, M.D., both of NCI&#8217;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and their colleagues, evaluated trends in anal cancer using data from the <a href="http://hivmatch.cancer.gov/">HIV/AIDS Cancer Match Study</a>. Their findings were published online October 5, 2012, in the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>. A primary strength of this study was the availability of population-based data on anal cancer and AIDS diagnoses over the course of the HIV epidemic, starting in the early 1980s. Of note, HIV-positive anal cancer cases were more likely to be male, younger than age 50 at the time of diagnosis, and non-white, compared to HIV-negative cases, and a majority of the HIV-positive males were men who had sex with&#160; men. Identifying these trends in anal cancer risk highlights the importance of cancer prevention among HIV-infected individuals.</p></div>]]></row>

  	</div><p>Previously, results from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) identified common inherited genetic markers that were associated with response to hepatitis C virus treatment and spontaneous clearance of the infection. Those markers are located on chromosome 19 near a known interferon gene,&#160;IFNL3 (IL28B)<i>.</i> However, molecular investigations into IFNL3 did not explain the GWAS association with spontaneous virus clearance or treatment response. To find the new gene, the investigators used a technology involving RNA sequencing on human liver cells treated to mimic hepatitis C virus &#160;infection.</p><p>&#8220;By using RNA sequencing we looked outside the box to search for something beyond what was already known in this region. We hit the jackpot with the discovery of a new gene. It is possible that other important genes may be discovered using this approach,&#8221; said co-lead investigator Ludmila Prokunina-Olsson, Ph.D., of the&#160; Laboratory of Translational Genomics in NCI&#8217;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG). &#160;</p><p>The researchers found that the IFNL4 region harbors a variant that is found in two alternative forms. One form, called deltaG, results in a &#160;deletion in one of the four bases that comprise DNA. The change creates an alteration known as a frameshift, which produces the IFNL4 protein, while the form without the deletion does not produce IFNL4.&#160; By analyzing data from hepatitis C-infected African-Americans and European-Americans participating in clinical studies, the authors found that the presence of the IFNL4 protein is associated with poorer clearance and response to treatment than the form that does not produce IFNL4. The deletion variant is more common in people of African ancestry, which helps partially explain why African-Americans have a lower response to current hepatitis C treatments than patients of Asian and European ancestry.</p><p>&#8220;Our work fulfills several promises of the genomic era,&#8221; said NCI&#8217;s Thomas R. O&#8217;Brien, M.D., Infections and Immunoepidemiology Branch, DCEG. &#8220;One, a better understanding of biology; two, personalized medicine; and three, new potential treatments. We deliver immediately on the first two. We&#8217;ve identified a new gene that may help us better understand response to viral infection and the new genetic marker may transition to clinical practice because it predicts treatment outcome for African-American patients better than the current genetic test. For the third, the INFL4 protein may be used as a novel therapeutic target for hepatitis C virus infection, and possibly other diseases.&#8221;</p><p>The new gene belongs to what is now a family of four interferon-lambda protein-encoding genes, three of which were discovered more than ten years ago (IFNL1, IFNL2 and IFNL3) The mechanism by which the IFNL 4 protein impairs hepatitis C virus clearance remains unknown. Further studies will explore molecular function of this novel protein in normal and disease conditions. &#160;</p><p>This study was conducted collaboratively with the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases at NIH, as well as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and a number of universities and research institutions.

<div>The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975&ndash;2009, shows that overall cancer death rates continued to decline in the United States among both men and women, among all major racial and ethnic groups, and for all of the most common cancer sites, including lung, colon and rectum, female breast, and prostate.

<p>The report, produced since 1998, is co-authored by researchers from the American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). It appears early online in the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i> and will be published in print issue 3, volume 105.</p>
<p>The decline in overall cancer death rates continues a trend that began in the early 1990s.&nbsp; From 2000 through 2009, cancer death rates decreased by 1.8 percent per year among men and by 1.4 percent per year among women. Death rates among children up to 14 years of age also continued to decrease by 1.8 percent per year. During 2000 through 2009, death rates among men decreased for 10 of the 17 most common cancers (lung, prostate, colon and rectum, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney, stomach, myeloma, oral cavity and pharynx, and larynx) and increased for melanoma of the skin and cancers of the pancreas and liver. During the same 10-year period, death rates among women decreased for 15 of the 18 most common cancers (lung, breast, colon and rectum, ovary, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, brain and other nervous system, myeloma, kidney, stomach, cervix, bladder, esophagus, oral cavity and pharynx, and gallbladder) and increased for cancers of the pancreas, liver, and uterus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The continuing drop in cancer mortality over the past two decades is reason to cheer,&rdquo; said John R. Seffrin, Ph.D., chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society. &ldquo;The challenge we now face is how to continue those gains in the face of new obstacles, like obesity and HPV infections. We must face these hurdles head on, without distraction, and without delay, by expanding access to proven strategies to prevent and control cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Between 2000 and 2009, overall cancer incidence rates decreased by 0.6 percent per year among men, were stable among women, and increased by 0.6 percent per year among children (ages 0 to 14 years). During that time period, incidence rates among men decreased for five of the 17 most common cancers (prostate, lung, colon and rectum, stomach, and larynx) and increased for six others (kidney, pancreas, liver, thyroid, melanoma of the skin, and myeloma). Among women, incidence rates decreased for seven of the 18 most common cancers (lung, colon and rectum, bladder, cervix, oral cavity and pharynx, ovary, and stomach), and increased for seven others (thyroid, melanoma of the skin, kidney, pancreas, leukemia, liver, and uterus). Incidence rates were stable for the other top 17 cancers, including breast cancer in women and non-Hodgkin lymphoma in men and women.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While this report shows that we are making progress in the fight against cancer on some fronts, we still have much work to do, particularly when it comes to preventing cancer,&rdquo; said CDC Director Thomas R. Frieden, M.D. &ldquo;For example, vaccinating against HPV can prevent cervical cancer, but, tragically, far too many girls are growing into adulthood vulnerable to cervical cancer because they are not vaccinated.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The special feature section of the report includes an evaluation of the burden and trends in HPV-associated cancers as well as HPV vaccination coverage levels among adolescent girls. The report shows that from 2000 through 2009, incidence rates for HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer increased among white men and women, as did rates for anal cancer among white and black men and women. Incidence rates for cancer of the vulva increased among white and black women. Rates of cervical cancer declined among all women except American Indian/Alaska Natives. In addition, cervical cancer incidence rates were higher among women living in low versus high socioeconomic areas. Among men, rates for penile cancer were stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s Report correctly and usefully emphasizes the importance of HPV infection as a cause of the growing number of cancers of the mouth and throat, the anus, and the vulva, as well as cancers of the uterine cervix, and the availability of vaccines against the major cancer-causing strains of HPV&rdquo; said NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. &ldquo;But the investments we have made in HPV research to establish these relationships and to develop effective and safe vaccines against HPV will have the expected payoffs only if vaccination rates for girls and boys improve markedly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also showed that in 2010, fewer than half (48.7 percent) of girls ages 13 through 17 had received at least one dose of the HPV vaccine, and only 32 percent had received all three recommended doses. Vaccination series completion rates were generally lower among certain sub-populations, including girls living in the South, those living below the poverty level, and among Hispanics. The national three-dose coverage estimate among girls ages 13 through17 in 2010 falls well short of the U.S. Government&rsquo;s Healthy People 2020 target of 80 percent for three-dose coverage among girls ages 13 through15, and is much lower than vaccination rates &nbsp;reported in Canada (50-85 percent) and the United Kingdom and Australia combined (greater than 70 percent). The authors note that low overall vaccine uptake in the U.S. is likely due to a number of issues, including inadequate provider recommendations, provider reimbursement concerns, infrequent use of reminder/recall systems that would foster completion of the three-dose series, and other factors.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As incidence rates for some HPV-associated cancers continue to rise,&rdquo; noted NAACCR director Betsy Kohler, &ldquo;these cases will contribute to the overall growing number of cancers associated with population aging and expansion, requiring additional resources for medical research and treatment, in addition to our careful tracking of these trends.&rdquo;</p>

</ul>
</div>
<p><b>1. What is the purpose of this report and who created it?</b><br />This report provides a regular update of cancer incidence (new cases) and mortality (death) rates and trends in these rates in the United States. The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) have collaborated since 1998 to create the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer. The special feature section of this year&rsquo;s report highlights the burden and trends in human papillomavirus (HPV)-associated cancers as well as HPV vaccination coverage levels among adolescent girls.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. What are the sources of the data?</b><br />Cancer mortality information in the United States is based on causes of death reported by physicians on death certificates and filed by each state&rsquo;s vital statistics offices. The mortality information is processed and consolidated in a national database by the CDC through the National Vital Statistics System, which covers the entire United States.</p>
<p>Information on newly diagnosed cancer cases occurring in the United States is based on data collected by registries in the CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR) and NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program. NAACCR evaluates data annually from registries in both programs and provides combined data for this analysis.</p>
<p>Long-term (1992-2009) overall incidence trends for all cancer sites combined and for the 15 most common cancers were based on SEER incidence data covering about 14 percent of the U.S. population. Data from combined NPCR and SEER population-based cancer registries were used to estimate cancer incidence rates and short-term (2000-2009) trends for each of five major racial and ethnic groups: white, black, Asian and Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic. For the time period 2005-2009, 47 registries (covering 93 percent of the U.S. population) met NAACCR data quality criteria, and for the time period 2000-2009, 42 registries (covering 87 percent of the U.S. population) met these criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. Which reporting periods were chosen as a main focus of the report?</b><br />The period from 2005-2009 was used for describing the U.S. burden of cancer (rates), and the period from 2000-2009 was used for describing trends in cancer incidence and death rates among the country&rsquo;s five major racial and ethnic groups. The period from 1975-2009 was chosen to represent the best perspective on long-term trends in cancer death rates among all races combined, while the period from 1992-2009 was chosen to represent the best perspective on long-term incidence trends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. What is detailed in the special feature section of this year&rsquo;s report?</b><br />In this year&rsquo;s special feature section, the authors highlight the burden and trends in HPV-associated cancers among men and women ages 15 years and older as well as HPV vaccination coverage levels among adolescent girls ages 13 through 17 years in two years: 2008 and 2010. The report also presents the prevalence of Pap testing (cervical cancer screening) among women ages 21 through 65 in 2010.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update on Incidence and Mortality Trends for All Cancer Sites Combined and the Most Common Cancers</span></b></p>
<p id="que5">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. What is happening with cancer incidence trends overall?</b><br />From 2000 through 2009, incidence rates for all cancers combined declined 0.6 percent per year among men and were stable among women, and increased by 0.6 percent per year among children 14 years and under (see Table 1 of the Report).</p>
<p>Declines in cancer mortality rates are always good news, but the same is not always true for incidence rates. Declines in cancer incidence rates that occur as a result of decreased modifiable risk factors or increased use of those screening tests (colorectal and cervical cancer screening) that allow the detection and removal of precancerous lesions are good news. However, a drop in screening rates can also make it appear that incidence rates are lower while in fact some cancers will not be detected early and may not be discovered until they are at a more advanced stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6. What is happening with long-term incidence trends for the most common cancers?</b><br />From 2000-2009, incidence rates decreased for five of the 17 most common cancers among men (prostate, lung, colon and rectum, stomach, and larynx). In contrast, incidence rates increased among men for six cancers (kidney, pancreas, liver, thyroid, melanoma of the skin, and myeloma) during the same time period (see Table 1 of the Report).</p>
<p>Among women, incidence rates from 2000-2009 decreased for seven of the 18 most common cancers (lung, colon and rectum, bladder, cervix, oral cavity and pharynx, ovary, and stomach), and increased for seven cancers (thyroid, melanoma of the skin, kidney, pancreas, leukemia, liver, and uterus).</p>
<p>Incidence rates were stable for the other most common cancers in men and women from 2000-2009, including female breast cancer and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.</p>
<p>Note that findings are presented for the top 17 cancers among men and 18 cancers among women in order to accommodate the top 15 cancers for all races and ethnicities combined and for each major racial and ethnic group.</p>
<p id="que7">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>7. What is happening with cancer mortality trends overall?</b><br />Overall cancer death rates continued to decline, a trend that began in the early 1990s. From 2000 through 2009, death rates decreased by 1.8 percent per year among men, by 1.4 percent per year among women, and by 1.8 percent per year among children ages 0-14 and 0-19 years (see Table 2 of the Report). Death rates are the best indicator of progress against cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>8. What is happening with death rates for the most common cancers among men and women?</b><br />For the most recent 10-year period (2000-2009), death rates among men decreased for 10 of the 17 most common cancers (lung, prostate, colon and rectum, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, kidney, stomach, myeloma, oral cavity and pharynx, and larynx) and increased for four others (cancer of the pancreas, liver, soft tissue including heart, and melanoma of the skin) (see Table 2 of the Report).</p>
<p>During the same period, death rates among women decreased for 15 of the 18 most common cancers (lung, breast, colon and rectum, ovary, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, brain and other central nervous system, myeloma, kidney, stomach, cervix, bladder, esophagus, oral cavity and pharynx, and gallbladder) and increased for cancers of the pancreas, liver, and uterus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9. If cancer death rates continue to fall, does that mean the number of people dying from cancer will also continue to fall?</b><br />Not necessarily. The data described in the report are rates (number of deaths per 100,000 persons in the United States) and are adjusted for age so they can be compared across groups that vary by factors such as race, time period, and regions with different age structures. The actual number of people dying from cancer (sometimes called the count) can be influenced by several factors, including the growth in the number of older people in the United States (cancer is primarily a disease of aging) and the increase in size of the population.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the cancer death rate may go down in a given year, the actual number of cancer deaths could go up because the number of older Americans is increasing and the size of the population overall is increasing,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>10. What is happening with childhood cancer rates?</b><br />Cancer incidence rates increased 0.6 percent each year from 1992 through 2009 among children ages 14 years or younger. However, considerable progress has been seen for many types of childhood cancers, resulting in overall declines in death rates for cancer among children since at least 1975. In the most recent 10-year period, cancer death rates among children ages 0 to14 years and 0 to 19 years declined 1.8 percent per year.</p>

<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Burden and Trends in HPV-Associated Cancers and HPV Vaccination Coverage Levels&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>11. Why is it important to monitor the burden of and trends in HPV-associated cancers and HPV vaccination coverage levels?</b><br />Due to recent advances in our understanding of HPV-associated cancers in the U.S., an updated evaluation of the burden and trends in this diverse spectrum of diseases is needed to inform cancer prevention and control programs as well as to inform the public. Notably, HPV-associated cancers have been receiving additional attention from the cancer research community and were the focus of the current President&rsquo;s Cancer Panel, underscoring the importance of updated knowledge regarding the occurrence of these cancers in the U.S.</p>
<p>Monitoring trends in HPV vaccination coverage levels is useful to ensure the equitable uptake of the vaccine among different population subgroups. It also highlights the important role of vaccination in the prevention of both cervical and non-cervical HPV-associated cancers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>12. What cancers are associated with HPV infection?</b><br />Virtually all cervical cancers are due to HPV infection, along with 90 percent of anal cancers, more than 60 percent of certain sub-sites of oropharyngeal cancers (including the base of the tongue, tonsils, and other oropharynx), and approximately 40 percent of vagina, vulva, and penile cancers are associated with HPV infection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>13. What is the burden of HPV-associated cancers in the United States?</b><br />In 2009, a total of 34,788 HPV-associated cancers occurred among men and women (13,466 and 21,342, respectively) in the United States based on cancer registries that cover about 93 percent of the population. These cancers accounted for 3.3 percent of all cancer cases diagnosed in 2009 (See Figure 1of the Report). Cervical cancer alone represents 53.4 percent of the total number of HPV-associated cancers among women and 32.7 percent of all HPV-associated cancers, whereas oropharyngeal cancer accounts for 78.2 percent of HPV-associated cancers among men, 11.6 percent among women, and 37.3 percent among men and women combined. HPV-associated cancers are defined as cancers at specific anatomic sites with specific cellular types in which HPV DNA frequently is found. Not all of these cancers may be HPV-positive because HPV testing was not conducted.</p>
<p id="que14">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>14. What is happening with incidence rates of HPV-associated cancers?</b><br />From 2000-2009, incidence rates increased for HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancer among white men and women, for anal cancer among white and black men and women, and for cancer of the vulva among white and black women (see Figure 3 of the Report). In contrast, cervical cancer incidence rates decreased for women in all racial and ethnic groups except American Indian/Alaska Native women. Trends for other HPV-associated cancers are provided in Figure 3 in the Report.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>15. Which cancers does the HPV vaccine prevent and who should receive it?</b><br />Two vaccines (known as bivalent and quadrivalent) are available to protect against HPV types 16 and 18, which account for most HPV-associated cancers. Both vaccines are approved for the prevention of cervical cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18; the quadrivalent vaccine has also been approved for prevention of vaginal, vulvar, and anal cancers. No data are available on their ability to prevent HPV-associated lesions of the oropharynx. The quadrivalent vaccine also protects against HPV types 6 and 11, which cause most genital warts.</p>
<p>The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends routine vaccination of girls ages 11 or 12 with three doses of either the bivalent or quadrivalent HPV vaccine and routine vaccination of boys ages 11 or 12 with three doses of quadrivalent vaccine. Vaccination is also recommended for females ages 13 through 26 and males ages 13 through 21 who were not vaccinated previously. Males ages 22 through 26 may also receive the vaccine. For men who have sex with men and for immunocompromised males, ACIP recommends routine vaccination with quadrivalent HPV vaccine as for all males, and vaccination through age 26 years for those who were not vaccinated previously.</p>
<p id="que16">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>16. What is happening with HPV vaccination coverage levels?</b><br />In 2010, less than half (48.7 percent) of adolescent girls ages 13 through 17 nationwide had received one or more doses of HPV vaccine, and fewer than one in three (32.0 percent) had received three doses (see Table 6 and Figure 4 of the Report). State-level HPV vaccination coverage levels varied widely in 2010. For example, 28.8 percent of adolescent girls in Idaho had received at least one dose compared to 73.0 percent in Rhode Island.</p>
<p>Virtually all socio-demographic groups showed increases in HPV vaccination between 2008 and 2010, although not all the increases were statistically significant (see supplemental Table 2 of the Report). Among girls who initiated the series, and had enough time to complete it before the interview date, three-dose series completion was lower among Hispanics versus non-Hispanic whites and among those living below the poverty level versus those living above the poverty level. Three-dose series completion rates were higher among privately insured girls versus uninsured girls or those with public insurance in 2010.</p>
<p>National HPV vaccination coverage estimates for 2011 were not available for this analysis, but they show that between 2010 and 2011, coverage with at least one dose of the HPV vaccine increased from 48.7 percent to 53 percent; three-dose coverage increased from 32.0 percent to 34.8 percent; and three-dose series completion rates increased from 69.6 percent to 70.7 percent.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>17. What is happening with Pap testing among women ages 21-65?</b><br />Nationally, 86.7 percent of women received a Pap test during the previous three years per a survey in 2010. The prevalence of Pap testing varied by state, ranging from 80 percent in Arkansas, Oregon, and Utah to 93 percent in Massachusetts, where cervical cancer rates are low (see Table 6 of the Report). State-specific Pap test prevalence was generally lower among women without insurance or a usual source of medical care.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Read This Report&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>18. How are cancer incidence and death rates presented?</b><br />Cancer incidence rates and death rates are typically measured as the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 people per year and are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population. When a cancer affects only one sex&mdash;for example, prostate cancer&mdash;then the number is per 100,000 persons of that sex. The numbers are age-adjusted, which allows for comparison of rates from different populations with varying age composition over time and in different regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>19. What is annual percent change or APC?</b><br />The annual percent change (APC) is the average rate of change in a cancer rate per year in a given time frame (i.e., how fast or slowly a cancer rate has increased or decreased each year over a period of years). The APC was calculated for both incidence and death rates. The number is given as a percent, such as: an approximate 1 percent per year decrease. The APC is calculated using joinpoint regression (see below for an explanation of joinpoints).</p>
<p>A negative APC describes a decreasing trend, and a positive APC describes an increasing trend. In this report, all trends mentioned in the text are statistically significant unless noted otherwise. For non-statistically significant trends, terms such as &ldquo;stable,&rdquo; &ldquo;non-significant increase,&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-significant decrease&rdquo; were used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>20. What is average annual percent change or AAPC?</b><br />The report also uses the average annual percent change (AAPC) as an addendum to the underlying joinpoint (see below for an explanation of joinpoints) annual percent change (APC) trends as a summary measure to compare fixed interval trends among racial and ethnic groups.</p>
<p>The AAPC quantifies the average trend over a fixed period of multiple years.</p>
<p>Similar to the APC, a negative AAPC describes a decreasing trend, and a positive AAPC describes an increasing trend. In this report, all trends are statistically significant unless noted otherwise. For non-statistically significant trends, terms such as &ldquo;stable,&rdquo; &ldquo;non-significant increase,&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-significant decrease&rdquo; were used.</p>
<p>Long-term trends can obscure shorter term changes. Differences in the 5-year and 10-year AAPCs typically identify types of cancer where the 10-year average trend may mask important recent changes. For example, in this report the trend for lung cancer deaths shows a more rapid decline when looking at the 5-year AAPC than the 10-year AAPC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>21. What is joinpoint regression analysis, and how does it account for the different time periods used for trends analysis in this report?</b><br />Joinpoint regression analysis is a statistical method that describes changing trends over successive segments of time and the amount of increase or decrease within each segment. This analysis involves fitting a series of joined straight lines to the age-adjusted rates and choosing the best-fitting point or points, called joinpoints, where the rate of increase or decrease changes significantly. Thus, each joinpoint denotes a statistically significant change in trend. The resulting line segment between joinpoints can be described by an annual percent change that is based on the slope of the line segment. Joinpoint analyses were performed for incidence and mortality trends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>22. Why are absolute changes versus relative changes presented to assess changes in vaccination coverage levels?</b><br />Absolute percentage increase is used because it most closely reflects the improvement in the number of adolescents protected against HPV infection. Relative percentage increase, in contrast, cannot be directly translated into an increase in the number of individuals protected because the true increase in the number of protected individuals cannot be determined.</p>
<p>For example, in a hypothetical population of 10,000 individuals with baseline vaccination coverage of 50 percent, an absolute increase of 10 percent would correspond to 60 percent coverage and 1,000 additional people protected. On the other hand, a relative increase of 10 percent would correspond to 55 percent coverage (10 percent of 50 percent = 5 percent) and 500 additional people protected.</p>
<p><b>23. Why were rates adjusted for delays in reporting incidence data to SEER?</b><br />The report presents analyses of long-term trends in cancer incidence rates with and without adjustment for reporting delays and more complete information. Adjusting for these delays and accumulating more complete and accurate information provides the basis for a potentially more definitive assessment of incidence rates and trends, particularly in the most recent years for which data are available. Cancer registries routinely take two to three years to compile their current cancer statistics. An additional one to two years may be required to have more complete incidence data on certain cancers, such as melanomas and leukemias when they are diagnosed in outpatient settings. Cancer registries continue to update incidence rates to include these cases. Consequently, the data initially reported for certain cancer incidence rates may be an underestimate. Long-term reporting patterns in NCI&rsquo;s SEER registries have been analyzed, and it is now possible to adjust incidence rates for all cancers combined and for site-specific cancers with a correction for expected reporting delays and more complete information. However, SEER registries do not cover the entire population, thus combined data from SEER and CDC&rsquo;s National Program of Cancer Registries (which is not delay adjusted) is important for assessing the incidence of cancer in the United States. Methodologic research is in progress to adjust for reporting delays of pooled data from SEER and the National Program of Cancer Registries.</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Information&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p><b>24. What other data issues need to be considered?</b><br />This report uses 2001-2009 postcensal population estimates (which quantify changes since the previous census) from the U.S. Census Bureau to calculate incidence and death rates. Differences between the true population counts and postcensal population estimates may have increased as time has passed from the 2000 Census. These differences may result in incidence and death rates being either underestimated or overestimated.</p>

<p><i>NIH-funded study shows doubling in survival time for patients with two different chromosomal deletions</i></p>

<p>A clinical trial has shown that addition of chemotherapy to radiation therapy leads to a near doubling of median survival time in patients with a form of brain tumor (oligodendroglioma) that carries a chromosomal abnormality called the 1p19q co-deletion. This abnormality is characterized by the simultaneous deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 and long arm of chromosome 19. The presence of the chromosomal abnormality was associated with substantially better prognosis and marked improvements in survival in a treatment program of combined chemotherapy and radiation therapy compared to radiation therapy alone.&#160; Oligodendrogliomas are characterized by tumors that form in the nerve tissue of the brain. The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p>In the trial, 286 patients with aggressive oligodendrogliomas were randomly assigned to study groups of equal size to receive radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus PCV chemotherapy, which includes the drugs procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine.&#160; Tumor tissue from all patients was collected and stored for genetic tests.&#160; The analysis was performed when about half of the patients had been followed for just over 11 years.&#160;</p>

<p>Oligodendrogliomas occur primarily in adults, and the average age at diagnosis is 35.&#160; The tumors comprise 9.4 percent of all primary brain and central nervous system tumors.</p>

<p>For the entire study population, the median overall survival time for patients receiving radiotherapy alone or radiotherapy plus PCV chemotherapy was similar. However, the 126 patients with 1p19q co-deleted tumors had much longer median survival times than the 135 patients whose tumors did not carry the 1p19q co-deletion: 8.7 years versus 2.7 years.&#160; This observation suggests that patients whose tumors contain the chromosomal abnormality will live substantially longer than patients whose tumors don’t carry it, regardless of treatment.&#160; Even more impressive, however, was the finding that 1p19q co-deletion predicted the benefit from adding chemotherapy to radiotherapy. Patients with 1p19q co-deleted tumors who received PCV chemotherapy plus radiotherapy (59 patients) had a median overall survival time of 14.7 years, compared with only 7.3 years for patients with co-deleted tumors who received radiotherapy alone (67 patients). Patients whose tumors did not have the chromosomal abnormality did not show an improvement in survival from the addition of chemotherapy.&#160;&#160;&#160;</p>

<p>The study, known as RTOG 9402, was led by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) with the participation of the North Central Cancer Treatment Group, the National Cancer Institute of Canada Clinical Trials Group, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group, and SWOG (formerly the Southwest Oncology Group).</p>

<p>“The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group and other participating cooperative groups are to be congratulated for conducting this randomized clinical trial in a rare form of brain tumor that took many years,” said Jeffrey Abrams, M.D., associate director, Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program, NCI.&#160; “Their persistence and dedication was rewarded as this genetic abnormality has a powerful effect on survival, and the results will change how patients with this disease are treated. This clinical trial also highlights the necessity for collecting tumor tissue for genetic studies to define more precisely the patients who benefit most from specific therapies.”</p>

<p>Currently, NCI is supporting two additional studies that attempt to improve on the treatment of these brain tumors.&#160; Details on both studies can be viewed at: &#160;&#160;</p>

  	</div><p>It has been known, primarily through population based studies, that there is a strong link between obesity and cancer. But the mechanism behind this link has been uncertain. A previous study conceived and carried out in Gardner&#8217;s laboratory found that CtBP repressed expression of a gene associated with breast cancer (BRCA1) at an early age by sensing when the cell was in a high metabolic state that, in turn, led to processing large amounts of carbohydrates in the body.</p><p>This early study suggested that obesity and weight gain may contribute to breast cancer by decreasing the level of the BRCA1 tumor suppressor gene expression in response to high carbohydrate intake. This explains, in part, why women who have hereditary mutations of BRCA1 also experience an increased risk of breast cancer if they gain weight.</p><p>Gardner&#8217;s new study expands upon his past work. He analyzed prior gene expression studies to determine if gene pathways, repressed by CtBP, were diminished in breast cancer patients who suffered from more aggressive clinical outcomes. Gardner&#8217;s team began first with the human breast cancer cells in the laboratory. They measured the association of CtBP and the genes it bound to in order to regulate expression. The researchers combined this approach with genome sequencing to confirm how, and where, CtBP bound to genes associated with breast cancer. Next, they integrated analyses with gene expression studies in cells in which they observed decreased the levels of CtBP by RNA interference (a process that inhibits gene expression), or by decreasing carbohydrate feeding of the cells.&#160;</p><p>The scientists found that, under conditions where they decreased the levels of CtBP, DNA repair increased and the cells developed stability and growth control. They determined that gene pathways targeted by CtBP were also disrupted in more aggressive breast cancers. Moreover, patients with high levels of CtBP in their tumors had shortened survival. And they showed that a small molecular inhibitor previously shown to bind to CtBP was able to reverse the gene-repressive effects of CtBP in breast cancer cells even under conditions of high carbohydrate feeding.</p><p>&#8220;Our new work suggests that targeting CtBP may provide a way of treating breast cancer and possibly preventing breast cancer,&#8221; said Gardner. &#8220;Research should continue to focus on the link between obesity, CtBP and breast cancer. This will require more population-based studies and multi-disciplinary teams of scientist to investigate these links.&#8221;</p><p>This project was funded by NCI project number 1Z01BC010847-01.</p><p align="center"># # #</p><p>Reference: Gardner K, et al.

  	</div><p>Findings from clinical trial patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma, a common kidney cancer, show they did not have accelerated tumor growth after treatment with sunitinib, in contrast to some study results in animals. Sunitinib is one of several drugs, either on the market or undergoing testing, that target blood vessel growth. There had been debate, based on the animal studies, about whether tumor blood vessel changes induced by these drugs promoted tumor growth and/or caused cancer to spread. In this study, Tito Fojo, M.D., Ph.D., head of the Experimental Therapeutics Section, Medical Oncology Branch and Affiliates, NCI, and his colleagues, found that not to be the case. Results of their study appeared in Cell Reports, Feb. 7, 2013.</p><p>Using a mouse model to assess small, relatively newly developed tumors can be much more challenging than assessment in humans who tend to have more established tumors several centimeters in size. To address whether sunitinib accelerated tumor growth in humans, researchers analyzed data from a randomized phase III trial comparing sunitinib with interferon alfa in patients with kidney cancer. Using a novel methodology for assessing efficacy <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>, they found sunitinib reduced the tumor&#8217;s growth rate while improving survival, without appearing to negatively alter tumor biology after discontinuation. Their findings suggest that concerns arising from animal models may not apply to patients receiving sunitinib and most likely will not apply to patients using similar agents, but recognize more studies may need to be done.</p></div>]]></row>

Patients treated with chemotherapy alone had a median survival of 13.3 months while those who received chemotherapy and bevacizumab had a median survival of 17 months. This survival difference was highly statistically significant.&#160; Progression free survival, meaning that after treatment the disease did not worsen, was 8.2 months for those who received bevacizumab vs. 5.9 months for those who received chemotherapy alone.</p><p>However, patients receiving bevacizumab experienced more side effects than those who did not. These side effects were consistent with side effects previously known to be associated with bevacizumab and included hypertension, neutropenia (a low white blood cell count), and thromboembolism, or formation of blood clots.&#160; Quality of life during the trial was also measured and there was no significant difference reported by patients between those who received bevacizumab and those who received chemotherapy alone.</p><p>&#8220;The findings in this clinical trial are important because they are likely to change clinical practice and provide an opportunity to improve outcome in patients with recurrent cervical cancer who have previously had very limited treatment options,&#8221; said GOG study chair Krishnansu S. Tewari, M.D.</p><p>A total of 452 patients in the United States and Spain with metastatic, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer not curable with standard treatment were enrolled between 2009 and 2012. The trial was designed to answer two questions: Whether topotecan in combination with paclitaxel was superior to cisplatin and paclitaxel in combination, and whether the addition of bevacizumab to either regimen improved overall survival.</p><p>Patients were randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups; two of the treatment groups received bevacizumab. In an analysis conducted in 2012, it was determined that topotecan plus paclitaxel was not superior to the standard therapy of cisplatin plus paclitaxel and investigators and patients were notified of the finding at that time.&#160;</p><p>The purpose of bevacizumab is to block the blood supply that feeds the tumor. The drug originally was approved for certain types of metastatic cancer in combination with chemotherapy and is designed to bind to and inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF).

Although these findings were based on small numbers of patients, they are intriguing in light of recent changes in treatment practices for these cancer patients.</p><p>The researchers noted that chemotherapy is often a very effective treatment for cancer, and the subsequent risk of leukemia is generally low for an individual patient. The authors indicated that the increased risk among NHL survivors could be due to prolonged survival in recent years for some lymphoma subtypes that are associated with multiple courses of chemotherapy.&#160;</p><p>Over the study time period, the researchers observed declining risk among patients treated for ovarian cancer, myeloma, and possibly lung cancer. The decreased risk among patients with ovarian cancer is consistent with a shift from use of an alkylating agent called melphalan to platinum-based chemotherapy in the early 1980s.</p><p>&#8220;It has long been known that some types of chemotherapy are associated with a high risk of developing subsequent leukemia, particularly when treatments include certain alkylating agents,&#8221; said lead author Lindsay Morton, Ph.D., in NCI&#8217;s Radiation Epidemiology Branch in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. &#8220;The goal of this study was to better understand how cancer patients&#8217; risk of developing leukemia has changed over time.&#8221;</p><p>The authors also found evidence that the risk of treatment-related AML has increased since 2000 among patients treated for esophageal, prostate, and cervical cancer and since the 1990s among patients treated for cancers of the bones and joints and of the endometrium.</p><p>Morton and colleagues used data from NCI&#8217;s Surveillance Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) cancer registries to evaluate the risk of leukemia in more than 426,000 adults who had been diagnosed with cancer between 1975 and 2008 and who had received chemotherapy as part of their initial cancer treatment.&#160; Among these patients, the authors identified 801 people who subsequently developed AML. Because the data came from SEER cancer registries, information on specific drugs used to treat each individual patient was not available.&#160; A unique feature of the study was the ability to evaluate leukemia risks in a large number of patients treated with chemotherapy in the current treatment era (2001-2008).</p><p>The researchers say it is important to identify patient groups that have the highest risks of treatment-related leukemia, particularly for patients with cancers that have favorable survival potential, so that efforts to prevent a return of the disease can be implemented where possible. Future studies are needed to gather information on the risks associated with specific chemotherapy agents, which could not be obtained from this study. &#160;</p><p>&#8220;In addition, it will be interesting to evaluate the role of a patient&#8217;s genetic susceptibility to treatment-related leukemia,&#8221; added Morton. &#8220;If certain inherited traits predispose patients to a second malignancy as a result of treatment, clinicians could more accurately weigh the risk of leukemia against the established benefits of chemotherapy.&#8221;</p><p>This research was supported with intramural funding via contract Z01 CP010131-18.</p><p style=" text-align: center;">###</p><p><b>Reference:</b> Morton LM et al.&#160; Evolving risk of therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia cancer chemotherapy among adults in the United States, 1975-2008.&#160; Blood, the journal of the American Society of Hematology.&#160; Feb. 14, 2013.</p></div>]]></row>

The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network study that appeared online Sept. 9, 2012, and in print Sept. 27, 2012, in the journal <em>Nature,</em> comprehensively characterized the lung squamous cell carcinoma genome. The study found a large number and variety of DNA alterations, many of which seem to be driving forces behind pathways that are important to the initiation and progression of lung cancer. TCGA is jointly funded and managed by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), both part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With these findings, TCGA researchers have set the stage for the development, testing and implementation of advanced diagnostics and therapeutics for lung squamous cell carcinoma,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.&nbsp; &ldquo;These findings also underscore the power and value of our nation&rsquo;s investment in The Cancer Genome Atlas.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Researchers have made important strides in understanding and developing precision medicine treatments for adenocarcinomas, which are the most common type of lung cancer.&nbsp; But these treatments have been largely ineffective in treating lung squamous cell carcinoma. Lung squamous cell carcinoma frequently develops in the large airways in the center of the lungs, while adenocarcinomas often arise at the edges of the lungs.&nbsp; Lung adenocarcinomas sometimes affect non-smokers, while lung squamous cell carcinomas arise almost exclusively in smokers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This report provides an unprecedented view of the spectrum and high rate of genomic mutations that are found in lung squamous cell carcinoma,&rdquo; said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., NHGRI director. &ldquo;We hope this report will spur basic research to better understand the genesis of the disease, and in clinical research as these new findings are factored into potential treatment approaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this study, researchers identified promising therapeutic targets, including three families of tyrosine kinases, which are enzymes that function as on or off switches in many cellular functions and are frequently mutated in cancer. These enzymes were found to be mutated or amplified in many of the tumors analyzed by TCGA investigators. Importantly, enzymes in these families have been established as potential therapeutic targets in pre-clinical studies and investigated clinically as therapeutic targets in other cancer types. In an ancillary finding, in 69 percent of the tumors studied, investigators detected gene alterations in important signaling pathways that could also serve as therapeutic targets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Genomic analysis of lung adenocarcinomas has led to many important therapeutic advances and this new research helps to explain why squamous lung cancers have not been responsive to drugs that work for adenocarcinomas,&rdquo; said Harold Varmus, M.D., director, NCI. &ldquo;Because the spectrum of mutations is very different in each type, the identification of these new mutations by TCGA researchers has the potential to lead to therapeutic advances for squamous lung cancers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For this study, researchers examined tissue samples from 178 patients with untreated lung squamous cell carcinomas. Notably, 96 percent of the patients in this study had a history of tobacco use. Researchers compared the tumor genome to the genome in normal tissue to make sure that a change in the tumor genome was the result of a mutation. The carcinomas exhibited a large number and variety of alterations, many of which appeared to deleteriously affect pathways that are important to the initiation and progression of cancer. Genes that help detoxify cells and repair damage, or are involved in cell specialization, were frequently altered.</p>
<p>Researchers also sequenced the whole genomes of 19 tumor and normal tissue pairs to gather comprehensive information about genomic rearrangements. This is the first TCGA report to describe whole genome sequencing, which allows researchers to map the variety of changes that can occur in a tumor&rsquo;s genome, including the breaking and rejoining of chromosomes and other large structural alterations that might be involved in the genesis of the disease. These whole genome data will be freely available for future in-depth analysis that could help locate mutations in intergenic regions, which are stretches of DNA sequences located between clusters of genes that may not encode proteins but sometimes control nearby genes.</p>
<p>Researchers found alterations of the TP53 genein 90 percent of the tumors and inactivation of the CDKN2A gene in 72 percent of tumors<i>.</i> In their non-mutated or unaltered state, both genes function as tumor suppressors to prevent cancer. When they are altered, however, cancer is able to grow unconstrained. Researchers also identified previously unreported mutations that reduce the function of the HLA-A gene in the tumors. HLA controls how the immune system distinguishes the body&rsquo;s own cells from foreign invaders.</p>
<p>Researchers speculate that mutations in the HLA gene may help the tumor escape the body&rsquo;s regular surveillance of mutated cells. Involvement of the HLA-A gene suggests that treatment strategies for some patients using customized immunotherapies could be effective. Recent clinical trials suggest that new biological agents, which work by decreasing the immune response and allow the immune system to react against cancer cells, may be effective treatments for some lung cancer patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These TCGA findings should stimulate a wide variety of new clinical trials for patients with squamous cell lung cancer and specific genotypic alterations,&rdquo; said <a href="http://benchmarks.cancer.gov/2012/09/matthew-meyerson-discusses-tcga-lung-squamous-cell-cancer-study">Matthew Meyerson</a>, M.D., Ph.D., of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Broad Institute and Harvard Medical School, who co-led the project within TCGA. &ldquo;These will include clinical trials of PI3 kinase inhibitors and other tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as well as ways to use genomics to select patients for trials of lung cancer treatments that dial down the immune response.&rdquo;</p>

Mackall, M.D., chief of the National Cancer Institute&#8217;s Pediatric Oncology Branch, &#8220;Progress against childhood cancer represents one of the success stories of modern medicine.&#160; Pediatric cancers were uniformly fatal 60 years ago, but today more than 75 percent of children diagnosed with cancer are cured.&#160; Still, cancer remains the leading cause of disease-related death in children over one year of age, and the late effects of standard therapies for childhood cancer are substantial.&#8221;&#160; The outcomes for high-risk pediatric patients (those diagnosed at advanced stages of their diseases) remain quite poor.</p><p>Mackall notes that there was significant progress made in treating childhood cancers from the 1960s until about 2000, but there has been a plateau in childhood cancer survival rates for the past decade, particularly for those children with solid tumors such as Ewing sarcoma. Of particular concern is the cost to a patient&#8217;s longer term health due to late effects of therapy, such as another cancer arising due to the toxicity of the initial treatment.&#160; Two-thirds of survivors have late effects, with one-third having severe late effects, despite the fact that survival rates still hover around 75 percent.</p><p>To address these challenges, researchers have been developing new immunotherapies, either administered alone or used in combination with standard chemotherapy, radiation therapy and/or surgery. &#160;When discussing immunotherapy, one approach that has been studied extensively is the use of cancer vaccines.&#160; In 2010, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first vaccine for any type of cancer&#8212;Sipuleucel-T (trade named Provenge)&#8212;to treat prostate cancer.&#160; This treatment prolongs life in prostate cancer but does not induce tumor regression and thus may have less applicability for more aggressive, rapidly growing cancers, such as many childhood cancers. &#160;Therefore, many clinicians are looking at whether tumor vaccines administered as pre-emptive or adjuvant therapies (those that follow or are added onto the primary therapy), might be beneficial in more aggressive cancers. This model is particularly relevant to the field of childhood cancers, where remission is often achieved even in the most aggressive diseases.</p><p>One type of adjuvant therapy is dendritic cell vaccination, which has been studied in NCI&#8217;s Pediatric Oncology Branch for patients with high-risk pediatric sarcomas.&#160; For this therapy, patients travel to the National Institutes of Health (NCI is part of NIH) clinical center, where lymphocytes are collected, then the patients return home to their local clinics for chemotherapy or radiation, and finally return to NIH after completion of standard therapy for a combination of dendritic cell vaccination plus therapy for reconstitution of their immune system.&#160; This therapy has shown dramatic impact on immune reconstitution with higher CD4 (a type of white blood cell, or lymphocyte, that is important in fighting infection) counts and early results suggest improved long-term control of the cancer.</p><p>Another, more aggressive immunotherapy that has the capacity to treat established cancers, is adoptive cell transfer, a method in which lymphocytes are withdrawn from a patient, activated and/or modified in a culture to boost their tumor-fighting ability, and then re-infused in the patient.&#160; This approach has shown benefit in treating some patients with melanoma. The technique is now being applied to children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in clinical trials at NIH. Although more than 95 percent of children initially diagnosed with ALL achieve remission, a significant number of them relapse. Once they relapse, the prognosis is poor, with ALL accounting for the most number of deaths from cancer in children.</p><p>Beyond cell transfer techniques, genetic engineering can be used to reprogram the patient&#8217;s lymphocytes to recognize and kill any cell that carries a specific target protein on its surface. For pediatric ALL, the CD19 protein has been demonstrated to be an effective target using this approach. Therapies targeting CD19 in pediatric leukemia can be quite potent, and destroy both malignant and healthy B cells. &#160;B cells are a type of white blood cell that comprises the immune system. While loss of healthy B cells is not desirable, standard medical practice allows patients to tolerate this side effect without substantial toxicity.</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5460440" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="2090" sys_dependentid="548893">

  	</div><p>The process of using genetically engineered T cells (another immune system cell) to recognize CD19 has already been demonstrated to be effective in adults with B cell malignancies, but studies in children are only now underway. In April 2013 at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research, Daniel W. Lee, M.D., assistant clinical investigator in NCI&#8217;s Pediatric Oncology Branch, and recipient of a fellowship from the non-profit St. Baldrick&#8217;s Foundation, discussed results from his ongoing clinical trial. This trial demonstrates anti-leukemia effects using lymphocytes engineered to target CD19 in cases of pediatric ALL that are refractory, or resistant to treatment.</p><p>Lee&#8217;s specific approach involves collecting T cells from children, modifying them in the laboratory so that they would attach to CD19 that is expressed by the leukemia cells.&#160; The number of modified T cells, called anti-CD19 CAR T cells, was increased nearly 60-fold in the laboratory before they were returned to the patients.</p><p>The researchers used this approach in patients whose disease was non-responsive or has returned after standard treatments.&#160; Thus far, the approach appears to be similarly tolerable and effective whether or not a person has had a bone marrow transplant, which many children with refractory ALL have previously undergone. &#160;This approach differs from one that, until fairly recently, has often been taken in adults, whereby the harvesting and expansion (increase in numbers) of the cells can take months.&#160; Pediatric patients are often in the terminal stages of their disease and don&#8217;t have months to wait.&#160; Therefore, Lee and his associates have developed a method that harvests and expands the cells in 11 days.&#160; This time differential turns out to be critical and life-saving.</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5460441" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="2090" sys_dependentid="548894">

This regimen uses infusion strategies in which doses of the drugs etoposide, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide are adjusted for greatest efficacy.</p><p>Fifty-one patients with untreated primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma were included in this phase II study. The maximum tumor diameter was 11 centimeters. All but two patients achieved a complete remission with DA-EPOCH-R therapy, and none of the patients with a complete remission have developed a recurrent lymphoma. The two patients who did not achieve a complete remission received radiation and have also not had their tumors recur.&#160; There was no evidence of other diseases developing later on or cardiac toxic effects. &#160;</p><p>&#8220;The high success of this regimen in greatly reducing the need for radiation and improving the cure rate in this disease may relate to specialized dosing and continuous infusion delivery of the EPOCH-R agents,&#8221; said Wilson.</p><p>To provide an independent assessment of their DA-EPOCH-R trial results, the researchers collaborated with investigators at Stanford University (Calif.)

It has long been recognized that a complex interaction exists between cancer causing mechanisms and inflammation. For example, inflammatory signaling molecules such as another protein known as interleukin-6 normally functions to combat infections. &#160;However, these molecules can also be produced in cancer tissue where they can promote malignant progression. The FBXW7 protein is known to help reduce the levels of many cancer-promoting proteins within cancer cells. This study is the first to describe how FBXW7 acts in cancer cells as well as in cells of the immune system to attenuate inflammatory signaling, which is accomplished by reducing the levels of C/EBPdelta, a protein that regulates the expression of many genes. The investigators showed that temporarily reducing the levels of FBXW7 in mice was sufficient to increase serum levels of interleukin-6, which is known to be associated with increased cancer risk and chronic inflammatory diseases. On the other hand, mouse and human cells with reduced levels of C/EBPdelta had more FBXW7 and blunted inflammatory signaling. These results provide an important mechanistic link between tumor suppression and inhibition of inflammation. The study, headed by Esta Sterneck, Ph.D., at NCI&#8217;s Center for Cancer Research, and colleagues, was published online in Nature Communications on April 9, 2013.</p><p>Because FBXW7 acts in cooperation with an enzyme known as GSK-3&#946;, this study also implicates GSK-3beta as an inhibitor of the inflammatory response.&#160; Paradoxically, GSK-3beta is mostly known as a pro-inflammatory agent and drugs that inhibit its activity are being developed for diseases such as Alzheimer&#8217;s, cancer, diabetes, obesity, and immune disorders. This work provides further evidence for a dual role that might complicate clinical applications of drugs targeted at inhibiting GSK-3beta.&#160; However, these new findings may be exploited to gain insights into the molecular events governing acute versus chronic inflammation in cancer and other diseases.</p></div>]]></row>

Researchers at the National Cancer Institute discovered that cells obtained from the lungs of CD47-deficient mice, but not from ordinary mice that have the CD47 gene, multiplied in a culture dish and spontaneously converted into stem cells. By adding specific growth factors, these stem cells could then be directed to become cells of any tissue type. More tests in animals are needed, but if they pan out it appears that injecting a drug that blocks CD47 in humans could stimulate patients to make more of their own stem cells, which could be used for regeneration of injured tissues and organs. This strategy would also bypass the rejection problems associated with using donor stem cells for therapy. David D.

However, practical application has been limited by the tendency of these stem cells to be rejected by the body and, most importantly, to cause cancer. Roberts and colleagues found that expression of Yamanaka factors could be stimulated in normal cells by simply decreasing CD47 expression. The resulting stem cells thrived in culture but did not form tumors when injected into mice. As part of this study, the researchers also found that c-Myc, one of the Yamanaka factors and a gene that is mutated in many cancers, is regulated by CD47 in healthy cells but not in cancer cells. This may be one reason that CD47-targeted drugs can selectively protect healthy tissues from adverse side effects of radiation therapy, while enhancing tumor shrinkage. Insights into the relationship between c-Myc and CD47 provided in this publication may take scientists another step toward improved treatments for patients with cancer.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>Researchers at the National Institutes of Health have discovered a genetic mutation that appears to increase production of red blood cells in tumors. The discovery, based on analysis of tissue from rare endocrine tumors, may help clarify how some tumors generate a new blood supply to sustain their growth, the researchers explained.</p>
<p>The finding could lead to information on how to hinder the growth of tumors and treat cancers associated with excessive production of red blood cells.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The finding has provided an important new lead that may yield information useful to understanding and treating a number of different tumor types&rdquo; said Constantine A. Stratakis, M.D., D.Sc., scientific director of the Division of Intramural Research at the NIH's <em>Eunice Kennedy Shriver</em> National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD).</p>
<p>Dr. Stratakis was a member of the research team that made the discovery. The team was led by the study&rsquo;s senior author, Dr. Karel Pacak, head of the Section on Medical Neuroendocrinology at NICHD. In addition to researchers at the NICHD, the team also included researchers at National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Cancer Institute, the University of Utah School of Medicine, in Salt Lake City, and the University of Belgrade, in Serbia.</p>
<p>Their findings appear in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>The researchers analyzed tumors from two patients. Both had a rare type of tumor, known as <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=990&amp;sys_revision=110&amp;sys_contentid=150740&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_folderid="" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="150740" sys_dependentvariantid="990" sys_relationshipid="6210923">paraganglioma</a>, which forms from chromaffin cells outside the adrenal glands, near blood vessels and nerves. Chromafin cells produce the hormone norepinephrine (adrenaline.) One patient also had a rare tumor of the duodenum known as a <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=990&amp;sys_revision=63&amp;sys_contentid=1912&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_folderid="" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1912" sys_dependentvariantid="990" sys_relationshipid="6210924">somatostatinoma</a>.</p>
<p>Since birth, both patients had <a href="http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/poly/" target="_blank">polycythemia</a>, a rare disease in which the body produces too many red blood cells.</p>
<p>Analysis of the tumor tissue revealed that it contained an alteration in one of the family of genes called hypoxia-inducible factors (HIFs). HIFs have been implicated in the development of tumors and the progression of cancers. HIFs are made of two subunits, termed alpha and beta, and those subunits have been found to play a role in cancers. In the current study, the researchers found that the altered HIF2A gene generated proteins that were broken down more slowly than the typical form of the gene. In the presence of these proteins, the researchers also documented increased levels of a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells.</p>
<p>HIF genes are most active in conditions of low oxygen, such as in tumor tissue. Dr. Pacak explained that previous studies have found that a patient&rsquo;s polycythemia has disappeared after a paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma (chromaffin cell tumors arising in the adrenal gland) was removed.</p>
<p>The researchers concluded that the mutation may have altered gene activity in a way that led to more tumors growing in the bodies of the patients they examined.</p>

<p>Investigators for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have detailed and broadly classified the genomic alterations that frequently underlie the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a deadly cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Their work paints a picture of a cancer marked by relatively few mutations compared to other types of cancer occurring in adults. They also found that AML is powerfully influenced by mutations in genes that cause epigenetic changes (chemical changes to the genome that do not change the DNA nucleotide sequence) that can affect the expression of genes. TCGA is jointly supported and managed by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), both part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>The findings, which appeared online May 1, 2013, in the New England Journal of Medicine set the stage for identifying potential new drug targets and treatment strategies for AML. They may also offer better guidance for predicting the severity of disease for individual patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results provide important new insights into the genomics of a deadly and difficult-to-treat cancer, and underscore the power and scope of The Cancer Genome Atlas project,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather than just random snapshots about individual patients, this study provides a more detailed look at the aberrant genomes of AML than we have ever had before,&rdquo; said NHGRI Director Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D. &ldquo;It has the potential to open up new directions in AML research, and perhaps, in the design of new therapeutics, its impact could be felt in the near future.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>AML, the most common acute form of adult leukemia, develops when immature white blood cells fail to mature and instead accumulate in the bone marrow. The leukemia cells reduce the production of healthy blood cells, leading to anemia, abnormal bleeding and infections, and, if untreated, death.</p>
<p>Researchers examined the genomes of tumor specimens from 200 adult cases of spontaneously occurring, newly diagnosed AML.&nbsp; These cases represented all of the known subtypes of AML in approximately the same proportion as the general population. In this way, the study provided a realistic view of the disease, particularly in the number and frequency of genomic alterations. Each AML genome was compared to the normal genome derived from a skin sample of the same patient. Out of the 200 samples, 50 were analyzed by using whole genome sequencing, which is an examination of the complete DNA blueprint of the cells. Researchers analyzed the genome&rsquo;s protein-coding regions in the remaining samples, and used powerful new sequencing methods to look at changes in RNA in each case.</p>
<p>By studying a large number of AML cases, investigators were able to predict that they have identified virtually all of the mutations that occur in at least 5 percent of AML patients. Surprisingly, they found that overall, AML genomes have relatively few mutations, and such tumors are among the least mutated adult cancers. The average number of mutations in genes for each AML genome was 13, in contrast to solid tumors such as breast, lung or pancreatic cancer, which often have hundreds of mutated genes.</p>
<p>Because investigators found more than 1,600 genes that were mutated at least once in the 200 samples, they organized the recurrently mutated genes into nine categories based on their function or the known pathways involved. Some of these categories include tumor suppressor genes, signaling genes and epigenetic modifiers, with the latter being the most frequently mutated class of genes in the study. Epigenetic changes are alterations to DNA that often involve the addition or removal of chemical tags (such as methyl groups), which can affect when genes are turned on and off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This data set helps to integrate what was previously fragmented information,&rdquo; said study co-leader Timothy J. Ley, M.D., associate director for cancer genomics at The Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t realize how few recurrent mutations there were, and no one was thinking even five years ago that AML was associated with a high frequency of mutations in genes that encode epigenetic modifiers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By finding comparatively few recurrently mutated genes, yet frequent alterations in genes that help control gene expression, the investigators may have narrowed the search for likely drug targets and disease markers.</p>
<p>Other results were also somewhat surprising. Researchers knew that mutations in signaling genes, which help control cell growth and development, were very common in AML, and thought that all AML samples may have at least one signaling gene mutation. But the TCGA findings showed that these genes are mutated in only 60 percent of cases. These include mutations in the gene FLT3, which occur in about a third of cases, making it one of the most commonly mutated genes in AML. FLT3 is important for normal blood cell development. The researchers also found that many AML patients have concurrent mutations in three commonly mutated genes: FLT3, NPM1 and DNMT3A. Patients with this combination of gene mutations appear to have a unique subtype of AML.</p>
<p>Investigators unexpectedly found recurring mutations in cohesin genes, which are important in cell division.</p>
<p>The study is the first to report a recurrently mutated microRNA gene in AML. MicroRNAs can play an important role in regulating gene expression, particularly in turning off gene activity.</p>
<p>Abnormal chromosome rearrangements and gene fusions (where two genes join to form a new, altered gene) are frequently useful in diagnosing and providing prognostic information for AML patients. The study uncovered many such fusions that had not been described before, and nearly half of the AML samples were found to have gene fusions.</p>
<p>Currently, only a few good markers exist to help guide treatment decisions for the majority of patients with intermediate risk. Some of the recurrently mutated genes identified in this study may allow for better prognostic information that will be relevant for AML patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never had such a complete picture of AML, and this data set will be mined by researchers for years,&rdquo; said co-study leader Richard Wilson, Ph.D., director of Washington University&rsquo;s Genome Institute. &ldquo;These findings have probably identified every pathway in which a modification &ndash; and perhaps new drugs &ndash; might be beneficial. They also further refine our understanding of the importance of individual mutations for disease classification and prognostication, and will help us build better disease models.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results will enable investigators to examine patient samples for mutation patterns and affected pathways, and to begin new studies to try to understand the relationships between these genetic mutations and treatment results,&rdquo; added Ley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study of AML reinforces the value of the approach we are using to study the genomic diversity among tumors of&nbsp;&nbsp; many different cancer types and even within a single kind of cancer such as AML,&rdquo; noted NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. &ldquo;Only such a systematic analysis of cancer types could have uncovered such clear patterns, such as the apparent importance in AML of genetic mutations that lead to changes in gene expression and cell traits.&rdquo;</p>

  	</div><p>Clinically, endometrial cancers fall into two categories: endometrioid (type I) and serous (type II) tumors. Type I is correlated with excess estrogen, obesity, and a favorable prognosis, while type II is more common in older women and generally has a less favorable outcome. Type I tumors are often treated with radiation therapy, which helps stop or slow cancer growth, given in addition to or after the primary treatment. Type II tumors are generally treated with chemotherapy, in which drugs are used to kill the cancer cells or stop them from growing.&#160;</p><p>Distinguishing between different types of endometrial cancers is currently based on histology, an examination of a thin slice of tissue under a microscope. But categorizing endometrial cancer tissues is often difficult, and specialists frequently disagree on the classification of individual cases.</p><p>In this study, investigators showed that approximately 25 percent of tumors that pathologists classified as high-grade endometrioid showed frequent mutations in TP53, a tumor suppressor gene, as well as extensive copy number alterations, a term for when a cell has too many or too few copies of a genomic segment. Both are key molecular characteristics associated with serous tumors, along with a small number of DNA methylation changes, which are additions of a basic chemical unit to pieces of DNA. Most endometrioid tumors, by contrast, have few copy number alterations or mutations in TP53, though there are &#160;frequent mutations in other well known cancer-associated genes, including PTEN, another tumor suppressor gene, and KRAS, a gene involved in regulating cell division.</p><p>These data suggest that some high grade endometrioid tumors have developed a strikingly similar pattern of alterations to serous tumors, and may benefit from a similar course of treatment.</p><p>&#8220;This study highlights the fact that some tumors with the same characterization by pathologists may have very different molecular features. That&#8217;s where these findings will be directly implemented in additional research, and also in the context of clinical trials,&#8221; said Douglas A. Levine, M.D., head of the Gynecology Research Laboratory at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, and a co-leader in the study.</p><p>According to the authors, the new findings provide a roadmap for future clinical trials for endometrial cancer.&#160; &#8220;Each tumor subtype might warrant dedicated clinical trials because of the marked genomic differences between them that are indicative of different drivers of cancer,&#8221; said study co-leader Elaine Mardis, Ph.D., co-director of the Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. &#160;&#8220;Developing therapies for each subtype independent of the other may improve outcomes, as has been shown in breast cancer.&#8221;</p><p>Investigators also found genomic similarities between endometrial cancers and other tumor types.&#160; Previous TCGA research showed that a form of ovarian cancer (high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma) and a subtype of breast cancer (basal-like breast cancer) share many genomic features. In this study, the scientists found that endometrial serous carcinoma also has some of these same genomic characteristics. The cancers share a high frequency of mutations in TP53 (between 84 and 96 percent) and a low frequency in PTEN, with only 1 to 2 percent mutated. Surprisingly, the researchers also found many shared characteristics between endometrioid tumors and colorectal tumors. Both cancer types demonstrate a high frequency of microsatellite instability, where the repair mechanism for DNA is broken, and mutations in POLE, a gene responsible for producing a protein involved in DNA replication and repair. These genomic changes led to high mutation rates in both tumor types.</p><p>&#8220;TCGA&#8217;s multidimensional approach to collecting genomic data, including clinical and pathology information, have made these findings possible,&#8221; said Harold Varmus, M.D., NCI director. &#8220;Without the integrated characterization of so many tumor samples, correlations between histology and genomic data may not have been observed or potential clinical outcomes identified.&#8221;<a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack">&#160;</a></p><p>With a complete analysis of the study&#8217;s findings, investigators have identified four novel genomic-based subtypes of endometrial cancer, which may set the stage for new diagnostic and treatment approaches. Each of the four genomic subtypes clustered together and was named for one of its notable characteristics:&#160;</p><ul><li>The POLE ultramutated group was named for its unusually high mutation rates and hotspot mutations (sequences highly susceptible to mutation) in the POLE gene. &#160;</li><li>The hypermutated microsatellite instability group exhibited a high mutation rate, as well as few copy number alterations, but did not carry mutations in the POLE gene.</li><li>The copy number low group showed the greatest microsatellite stability but a high frequency of mutations in CTNNB1, a gene critical for maintaining the linings of organs, such as the endometrium. &#160;</li><li>The copy number high subtype was composed of mostly serous tumors, but included some endometrioid samples. This subtype displayed copy number alterations and a mutation landscape that was characteristic of serous tumors.</li></ul><p>Endometrial cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States. NCI estimates that close to 50,000 women will be diagnosed with endometrial cancer in 2013, with more than an estimated 8,000 deaths from the disease. For a majority of patients diagnosed with aggressive, high grade tumors with metastases, the five-year survival rate is about 16 percent, though chemotherapy has been associated with an improvement in survival, and new targeted agents are being tested.</p><p>&#8220;Finding genomic similarities among types of breast, ovarian, endometrial and colorectal tumors once again reveals that cancer, although very complex, may have themes extending beyond tissue type that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit,&#8221; said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., NHGRI director. &#8220;These similar genomic features demonstrate hitherto unknown commonalities among these cancers.</p><p>To date, the TCGA Research Network has generated data and published analyses on glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian serous adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma and invasive breast cancer.

The tumor relies on the growth of new blood vessels to obtain oxygen and nutrients and to facilitate its spread to the lungs, brain, and bones. Surgical removal of these tumors is the recommended treatment. However, not all patients are candidates for surgical resection based on extent of disease or other conditions. Standard anticancer therapy has not been effective for treating patients with metastatic ASPS.&#160; The median survival time for patients with unresectable metastatic ASPS is 40 months, with a 5-year survival rate of 20 percent.&#160;</p><p>Cediranib is a drug that inhibits a class of proteins called vascular endothelial growth factor receptors which regulate blood vessel formation. The drug, developed by AstraZeneca, Wilmington, Del., has been tested in clinical trials against other cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer, kidney cancer, and colorectal cancer, with varying degrees of benefit.</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5460529" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="2090" sys_dependentid="565036">

  	</div><p>The research team from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), both parts of NIH, extended their recent genome sequencing study of skin bacteria, using DNA sequencing techniques optimized for identifying fungi. &#160;The study appears in the May 22, 2013 early online issue of Nature.</p><p>The researchers found that a single type of fungus, belonging to the genus Malassezia, is predominant on the head and trunk. Hands, which harbor a great diversity of bacteria, are home for relatively few types of fungi.&#160; In contrast, feet, including toenails, heels and toe webs contain tremendous diversity.</p><p>&#8220;Applying DNA sequencing to a study of the skin&#8217;s fungi is the natural progression in understanding microbial life that co-exists on our bodies,&#8221; said NHGRI Scientific Director Daniel Kastner, M.D., Ph.D. &#8220;Along with recent genome sequencing to define bacterial diversity, this analysis of fungal diversity provides a more complete human microbiome picture.&#8221;</p><p>&#8220;Fungal communities occupy complex niches, even on the human body,&#8221; said Heidi Kong, M.D., co-senior author and an investigator in the dermatology branch of NCI&#8217;s Center for Cancer Research. &#8220;By gaining a more complete awareness of the fungal and bacterial ecosystems, we can better address associated skin diseases, including skin conditions which can be related to cancer treatments.&#8221;</p><p>The researchers collected samples at 14 body sites from 10 healthy adults. DNA sequencing of the fungi in the samples identified fragments of DNA, called phylogenetic markers, which can be counted and used to distinguish one type of fungus from another.&#160; The sequencing efforts generated more than 5 million markers, from the samples, representing more than 80 fungal types, or genera. In contrast, traditional culturing methods produced 130 colonies of fungi that represented only 18 fungal genera.</p><p>In 20 percent of the study participants, the researchers observed problems such as heel and toe web scaling or toenail changes consistent with possible fungal infections. From genome sequencing analysis, the researchers found that different individuals with heel site infections have common fungal communities at that site, while those with toenail infections display tremendously different fungal communities.</p><p>&#160;&#8220;DNA sequencing reveals the great diversity of fungi, even those that are hard to grow in culture,&#8221; said Julie Segre, Ph.D., co-senior author and senior investigator, NHGRI Genetics and Molecular Biology Branch. Her expertise is the development of microbial DNA sequencing technology. &#8220;DNA sequencing enabled us to learn immeasurably more about where fungi predominate as a part of the human skin microbiome.&#8221;</p><p>The researchers identified fungi from two phyla, Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes, as part of the normal fungal census at the 14 skin sites. The most common genus Malassezia was present in 11 of 14 sites sampled on the body<i>.</i> The researchers found Malassezia fungus on every skin surface of healthy volunteers, whether on the back of the head, behind the ears, in nostrils and on the heels. Heels were also home to many additional fungi, including the genera Aspergillus, Cryptococcus, Rhodotorula, and Epicoccum.</p><p>&#8220;DNA sequence-based methods of identification enabled us to differentiate among species of fungi and to conclude that the diversity of fungi is highly dependent on the body site rather than the person who is sampled,&#8221; said Dr. Kong. A dermatologist, Dr. Kong explained why these sites were selected for exploration:&#160; &#8220;Our study focused on areas of the skin where we commonly find skin diseases that have been associated with fungi.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>The most complex site, the heel, is home to about 80 genus-level types of fungi. The researchers found about 60 types in toenail swab samples and 40 types in samples from the webs of the toes. &#160;Sites with moderate fungal diversity are inside the bend of the arm, inside of the forearm and palm, with each location supporting 18 to 32 genera of fungi. Surprisingly, head and trunk body sites &#8212; including the back, back of the neck, inside the ears, behind the ears, and between the eyebrows&#8212; have far fewer fungi types, with just two to 10 genera each.</p><p>The research team compared fungal diversity data with the skin bacteria on the same healthy adults. They found that while arms have high measures of bacterial diversity, they have lower fungal diversity. They found the reverse to be true for sites on the feet. Core body sites had neither a high bacterial diversity nor a high fungal diversity. The researchers had previously shown that bacterial diversity can be predicted by whether skin is moist, dry or oily. Fungal diversity, instead, seems to depend upon where a particular skin site is on the body.</p><p>The researchers observed, in addition, that there is greater similarity in the fungal community structure on the left and right sides of the same person&#8217;s body compared to the same body parts on any two individuals. Fungal communities also appear to be quite stable over time, with little change when tested on two separate occasions, up to three months apart.</p><p>&#8220;The data from our study gives us a baseline about normal individuals that we never had before,&#8221; Dr. Segre said. &#8220;The bottom line is your feet are teeming with fungal diversity, so wear your flip flops in locker rooms if you don&#8217;t want to mix your foot fungi with someone else&#8217;s fungi.&#8221;</p><p>For fluorescent microscope images of fungi on the skin, go to <a href="http://goo.gl/eJakd">http://goo.gl/eJakd</a>.</p><p align="center">###</p></div>]]></row>

  	</div><p>The finding that a single component of the immune system&#160;plays such a broad role in regulating immune function may explain why people with&#160;allergic and autoimmune diseases commonly have alterations in the&#160;BACH2 gene, said&#160;NCI researcher Rahul Roychoudhuri, M.D. &quot;This may be the first step in developing novel therapies for these disorders.&quot;</p><p>Studies known as genome-wide association studies, which analyze genetic variants among people to determine whether specific variants are associated with particular traits, were critical to the discovery. These studies showed that DNA from patients with diverse autoimmune disorders often had minor alterations in the BACH2 gene, which&#160;laid the&#160;foundation for&#160;this research.</p><p>&#8220;What was exciting was the opportunity to apply cutting-edge technology permitted by the completion of the Human Genome Project,&#8221; said NIAMS scientific director John O&#8217;Shea, M.D. &#8220;Using genome-wide approaches we were able to map the action of Bach2 across all genes. This enabled us to gain a clearer understanding of Bach2&#8217;s key role in the immune system.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>The immune system is comprised of a variety of cell types that must act in unison to maintain a healthy balance. White blood cells called CD4+T cells play a dual role within the immune system. Some CD4+T cells activate immune responses, whereas others, called regulatory T cells, function in the opposite direction by constraining immune responses. This duality is important because uncontrolled immune responses may result in immune system attacks against the body&#8217;s own cells and tissues, which occurs in allergic and autoimmune diseases. One of the hallmarks of uncontrolled immune responses is excessive tissue inflammation. Although tissue inflammation is a normal part of immune responses, excessive inflammation can lead to tissue and organ damage and may be potentially lethal. How CD4+T cells become either activating/inflammatory or regulatory is not well understood, according to the researchers.</p><p>&#8220;We found that the Bach2 gene played a key role in regulating the switch between inflammatory and regulatory cells in mice,&#8221; said NIAMS researcher Kiyoshi Hirahara, M.D. &#8220;The loss of&#160;the Bach2 gene in CD4+ T cells caused them to become inflammatory, even in situations that would normally result in the formation of protective regulatory cells.&#8221;</p><p>The team found that if mice&#160;lacked the&#160;Bach2 gene their&#160;cells became inflammatory and the mice died of autoimmune diseases within the first few months of life. When they re-inserted Bach2 (using gene therapy) into Bach2-deficient cells, their ability to produce regulatory cells was restored.&#160;</p><p>&quot;Although genes have been found that play specific roles in either inflammatory cells or regulatory cells,&#160;Bach2 regulates the choice between the two cell types, resulting in its critical role in maintaining the immune system&#8217;s healthy balance,&quot; said NCI principal investigator, Nicholas P. Restifo, M.D., &quot;It&#8217;s apt that the gene shares its name with the famous composer Bach, since it orchestrates many components of the immune response, which, like the diverse instruments of an orchestra, must act in unison to achieve symphonic harmony.&quot;</p><p>Restifo&#160;suggests that these&#160;findings have implications for cancer as well, since cancers co-opt regulatory T cells to prevent their own destruction by antitumor immune responses. He and his colleagues are now working toward manipulating the activity of the Bach2 gene, with the goal of developing a new cancer immunotherapy. Also, as this study was in mice, it must be replicated in humans before its findings can be applied in a clinical setting.</p><p>In addition to researchers from NCI and NIAMS, this research was supported by the JSPS Research Fellowship for Japanese Biomedical and Behavioural Researchers at NIH and includes contributions from scientists at the National Institutes of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, NIH; the Department of Transfusion Medicine, NIH; the Division of Veterinary Resources, NIH; the&#160; Center for Regenerative Medicine, NIH; the Sidra Medical and Research Centre, Doha, Qatar; and the Department of Biochemistry, Tohoku University, Sendai, Japan.</p><p align="center"># # #</p><p>Reference: O&#8217;Shea, JJ, Restifo, et al.

<p>Cervical cancer, a disease that will affect more than 12,000 women in the United States this year and more than a half million women worldwide, &nbsp;leads to significantly fewer deaths when effective early detection methods are available, either via a Pap smear or with a test for presence of the human papilloma virus (HPV).&nbsp; However, such tests aren&rsquo;t readily available to many women in low-resource settings, and even for those women with access to health care services, compliance with recommendations for testing is not assured. For example, among women with access to care, 50 percent of those who developed invasive cervical cancer had not been screened three years prior to their diagnoses. Until screening usage is widespread in all populations and incidence rates drop dramatically, there will be far too many deadly cases of this disease, and these cases will more likely be found in women from low-resource settings, both domestically and abroad.</p>
<p>If cervical cancer is caught sufficiently early, it often can be cured. Conversely, for those women who present with late-stage disease, there remains a need for better therapies. At this year&rsquo;s plenary session at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Chicago on June 2, 2013, issues related to cervical cancer were front and center. NCI was a large part of this discussion, having sponsored a clinical <a href="http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/116712-132">trial</a> that will have an important impact on the treatment of late-stage disease, and also having funded a screening <a href="http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/112133-132">trial</a> in India using a network of community outreach workers to offer low tech-screening by direct visualization of the cervix coated with dilute acetic acid (vinegar), a process known as VIA.</p>

<p>Discussants for the findings presented at ASCO were Ted Trimble, M.D., director of NCI&rsquo;s Center for Global Health, and for the screening trial, Sarah Kobrin, Ph.D., program director in the Process of Care Branch of the Behavioral Research Program, NCI. &nbsp;Trimble and Kobrin traveled to India to meet with a team of doctors, nurses, and community health workers, as well as two patients who had been in the trial (Reference: &ldquo;Effect of visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) screening by primary health workers on cervical cancer mortality: A cluster randomized controlled trial in Mumbai, India,&rdquo; by Surendra Srinivas Shastri, M.D., of Tata Memorial Hospital, India, and colleagues).</p>
<p>Commonly used in the U.S. and higher-resource countries, the Pap smear is a relatively sophisticated test that requires trained cytologists to examine the cells retrieved from the cervix and consistently identify samples that are abnormal.&nbsp; Shastri&rsquo;s study looks at the less sophisticated technique of VIA that relies on direct visualization of the cervix after it is swabbed with vinegar.&nbsp; His challenge was not only to identify a test that works, but also to find a method to get the test to women in communities where health care facilities and transportation may present challenges.</p>
<p>In the trial, local health workers and community residents were identified and trained to provide VIA to women who needed screening. More than 75,000 women from 10 communities had multiple rounds of VIA. &nbsp;The screened women were compared to over 76,000 women from 10 similar communities where women were informed about cancer risks and the available screening facilities, were given vouchers for free cervical cancer screening at Tata Memorial hospital, but were not offered the outreach system with VIA performed by community health workers. The trained outreach workers also helped ensure that women with abnormalities were escorted to Tata Memorial hospital, where they underwent re-examination with colposcopy (which uses a tool to provide an illuminated, magnified view of the cervix) and then received appropriate diagnostic testing and treatment.&nbsp; The findings from this study showed that the community screening group had a 31 percent reduction in death due to cervical cancer, which is significant.</p>
<p>The success of this trial in reducing death can be attributed to the combination of the VIA test and the outreach system Shastri&rsquo;s team developed. Interim results from this study were published in the International Journal of Cancer (Reference: &ldquo;A cluster randomized, controlled trip of breast and cervical cancer screening in Mumbai, India: methodology and interim results after three rounds of screening.&rdquo; 2010:126:976-84. Indraneel Mittra, Gauravi A Mishra, et al).&nbsp; Other studies that incorporated the VIA test did not show such positive results, perhaps because they had different systems of follow-up.</p>
<p>In Western populations, new cases of cervical cancer are not frequently seen at an advanced stage because early-stage detection is much more common and effective, via either a Pap smear or HPV test. Where not identified at an early, curable stage, cervical cancer can spread locally and into distant organs. Advanced cervical cancer is difficult to treat and is life-shortening for the generally young women who are diagnosed with it. <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>At ASCO, Trimble also discussed key findings of an NCI-supported clinical <a href="http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/116712-132">trial</a> (Reference: &ldquo;Incorporation of bevacizumab in the treatment of recurrent and metastatic cervical cancer: A phase III randomized trial of the Gynecologic Oncology Group&rdquo;).&nbsp; Preliminary results from this trial were announced by NCI in February 2013 (see <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=506205&amp;sys_revision=7&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="506205" sys_dependentvariantid="704" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="6213754">http://www.cancer.gov/news-events/press-releases/2013/gog240</a>).</p>
<p>Bevacizumab (Avastin) is a drug designed to bind to the VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) protein. Bevacizumab may block a tumor&rsquo;s ability to tap into nearby blood vessels and may prevent the tumor from connecting to the blood supply it needs for continued growth. This Gynecologic Oncology Group study used bevacizumab, along with other conventional chemotherapy agents, in women with advanced, recurrent, or metastatic cervical cancer that was not curable. The trial compared women who received bevacizumab plus chemotherapy with those who received chemotherapy alone and found those who received bevacizumab had lower mortality, with a nearly four month longer survival.&nbsp; This is a significant survival advantage for an advanced cancer that can progress rapidly.</p>
<p>Specifically, a total of 452 patients in the United States and Spain with metastatic, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer not curable with standard treatment were enrolled between 2009 and 2012. The trial was designed to answer two questions. First, it looked at two combinations of chemotherapy drugs, in an attempt to determine whether topotecan in combination with paclitaxel was superior to cisplatin and paclitaxel in combination. The study then examined whether the addition of bevacizumab to either regimen improved overall survival.</p>
<p>Patients who received bevacizumab lived a median 3.7 months longer than those who did not receive bevacizumab. Progression free survival, meaning that after treatment the disease did not worsen, was 8.2 months for those who received bevacizumab vs. 5.9 months for those who received chemotherapy alone. However, patients receiving bevacizumab experienced more side effects than those who did not. These side effects were consistent with side effects previously known to be associated with bevacizumab and included hypertension, neutropenia (a low white blood cell count), and thromboembolism, or formation of blood clots.&nbsp; Quality of life during the trial was also measured and there were no significant differences reported between those who received bevacizumab and those who received chemotherapy alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is welcome news, as progress has been very difficult against this cancer, and GOG physicians and patients who participated have made an important contribution,&rdquo; said Jeff Abrams, M.D., clinical director of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.</p>
<p>The trial in India of acetic acid and the trial in the United States of bevacizumab would seem, on the surface, to be unrelated. The facts are more nuanced. Vinegar is inexpensive but bevacizumab, like many advanced chemotherapy agents, is relatively expensive. Visualization of the cervix using acetic acid to improve early diagnosis combined with effective patient assistance and appropriate follow-up can make a difference in places where cervical cancer is the leading cause of women&rsquo;s cancer and women&rsquo;s cancer deaths. Bevacizumab is an option for therapy of already advanced disease. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NCI&rsquo;s hope is that the research reported at ASCO this year with acetic acid visualization will ultimately make the need for use of bevacizumab and chemotherapy agents, as well as for studies in advanced cervical cancer, a much reduced occurrence,&rdquo; said Elise Kohn, M.D., head of the gynecologic program in NCI&rsquo;s Clinical Investigations Branch.</p>

<p>Three NCI-supported trials were highlighted at the ASCO Annual Meeting in Chicago on June 2, 2013.&nbsp; The first <a href="http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/112133-132">trial</a>, examining screening for cervical cancer, demonstrated that visual inspection with acetic acid reduced cervical cancer mortality. The technique used, VIA, relies on direct visualization of the cervix after it is swabbed with vinegar. The trial was conducted in India by local health workers and community residents who were trained to provide VIA to women who needed screening. More than 75,000 women from 10 communities had multiple rounds of VIA. &nbsp;The screened women were compared to over 76,000 women from 10 similar communities where women were informed about cancer risks and the available screening facilities, were given vouchers for free cervical cancer screening at a nearby hospital, but were not offered the outreach system with VIA performed by community health workers. The findings from this study showed that the community screening group had a 31 percent reduction in death due to cervical cancer, which is significant. The success of this trial in reducing death can be attributed to the combination of the VIA test and the outreach system that was developed.</p>
<p>The second <a href="http://meetinglibrary.asco.org/content/116712-132">trial</a>, looking at treatment for cervical cancer, enrolled people with advanced, recurrent, or persistent cervical cancer that was not curable with standard therapy.&nbsp; The patients who had the drug bevacizumab (Avastin) added to their therapy lived 3.7 months longer than patients who did not receive the drug. &nbsp;Bevacizumab blocks the blood supply that feeds a tumor by binding to and inhibiting a growth factor that plays a critical role in tumor blood vessel growth. The clinical trial, GOG240, was sponsored by NCI and conducted by a network of researchers led by the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG). In another measure of trial success, progression free survival&mdash;meaning that after treatment the disease did not worsen&mdash;was 8.2 months for the women who received bevacizumab versus 5.9 months for those who received chemotherapy alone.</p>
<p>The third <a href="/clinicaltrials/NCT00884741">trial</a> incorporated bevacizumab, but this time for the treatment of an aggressive brain tumor known as glioblastoma, in newly diagnosed patients. The clinical trial, RTOG 0825, was sponsored by NCI and conducted by a network of researchers led by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and enrolled 637 patients. The primary objective of the trial was to determine whether the addition of bevacizumab to temozolomide and radiation improved progression-free and/or overall survival. Temozolmide is toxic to cancer cells and acts by inhibiting DNA replication. The drug is given orally and penetrates well into the central nervous system. The results of the trial showed no overall survival benefit for patients who received bevacizumab compared to patients who did not receive the drug (15.7 months vs. 16.1 months, respectively).&nbsp; Patients who received bevacizumab also experienced more side effects compared to those treated with chemoradiation alone.</p>

  	</div><p>The results of this study, carried out by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, in collaboration with the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), were published online June 17, &#160;2013, in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.</p><p>Historically, the majority of oropharyngeal cancers could be explained by tobacco use and alcohol consumption rather than HPV infection. However, incidence of this malignancy is increasing in many parts of the world, especially in the United States and Europe, because of increased infection with HPV type 16 (HPV16). In the United States it is estimated that more than 60 percent of current cases of oropharyngeal cancer are due to HPV16. &#160;Persistent infection with HPV16 induces cellular changes that lead to cancer.</p><p>HPV E6 is one of the viral genes that contribute to tumor formation. Previous studies of patients with HPV-related oropharynx cancer found antibodies to E6 in their blood.</p><p>&#8220;Our study shows not only that the E6 antibodies are present prior to diagnosis&#8212;but that in many cases, the antibodies are there more than a decade before the cancer was clinically detectable, an important feature of a successful screening biomarker,&#8221; said Aimee R. Kreimer, Ph.D., the lead Investigator from the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI.</p><p>Kreimer and her colleagues tested samples from participants in the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition Study, a long-term study of more than 500,000 healthy adults in 10 European countries. Participants gave a blood sample at the start of the study and have been followed since their initial contribution.</p><p>The researchers analyzed blood from 135 individuals who developed oropharyngeal cancer between one and 13 years later, and nearly 1,600 control individuals who did not develop cancer. The study found antibodies against the HPV16 E6 protein in 35 percent of the individuals with cancer, compared to less than 1 percent of the samples from the cancer-free individuals. The blood samples had been collected on average, six years before diagnosis, but the relationship was independent of the time between blood collection and diagnosis. Antibodies to HPV16 E6 protein were even found in blood samples collected more than 10 years before diagnosis.</p><p>The scientists also report that HPV16 E6 antibodies may be a biomarker for improved survival, consistent with previous reports. Patients in the study with oropharyngeal cancer who tested positive for HPV16 E6 antibodies prior to diagnosis were 70 percent more likely to be alive at the end of follow-up, compared to patients who tested negative.</p><p>&#8220;Although promising, these findings should be considered preliminary,&#8221; said Paul Brennan, Ph.D., the lead investigator from IARC. &#8220;If the predictive capability of the HPV16 E6 antibody holds up in other studies, we may want to consider developing a screening tool based on this result.&#8221;</p><p style=" text-align: center;">###</p><p><b>Reference:</b> Kreimer AR, et al.

The decrease seen in phase III trials was even more encouraging, with a median reduction time of 45.7 percent (from 727 days to 395 days). Although these median times don&#8217;t yet match the ideal OEWG target deadlines, they fall well within the absolute deadline recommendations. Because of the success in exceeding absolute deadlines, NCI shortened the timeframe even further for studies received for review after April 5, 2012, with an absolute deadline of 450 days for early phase trials and 540 days for phase III trials. This study of OWEG outcomes appeared online in the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>, June 17, 2013.</p></div>]]></row>

Their findings demonstrate that normal metabolism is altered in ccRCC tumor cells, and involves a shift from using one metabolic pathway to another. This change &#8211; termed a metabolic shift &#8211; correlates with tumor stage and severity in some cases.&#160;</p><p>The scientists also found mutations in a pathway that may cause increased aggressiveness in this cancer. Taken together, the findings may offer new insight into underlying disease mechanisms and potential treatments as well as an understanding of how some cancer cells can shift from using normal metabolic pathways to alternative pathways, thereby providing a growth advantage to tumor cells. In general, changes in metabolic enzymes that promote growth of the tumor are associated with worse patient outcomes in this disease. This latest TCGA research supports previous evidence of a metabolic shift in a different subtype of kidney cancer.&#160;</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5460457" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="2090" sys_dependentid="588572">

  	</div><p>The scientists used data generated by TCGA, a collaborative effort funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both parts of the National Institutes of Health. The results of this study were published online June 23, 2013, in Nature.</p><p>&#8220;Because of TCGA&#39;s comprehensive characterization of kidney tumors and correlating that with patient survival data, researchers now can begin applying this knowledge to validating prognostic biomarkers and identifying new therapeutic strategies for this disease,&#8221; said NIH Director, Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.</p><p>In the study, scientists examined nearly 450 ccRCC tumors and matched each with a normal sample from the same patient. When they looked at the amounts of specific proteins expressed in cancer cells, they found that low levels of one protein essential to cell metabolism (AMPK) and high levels of another (acetyl-CoA carboxylase) were associated with worse patient outcomes.</p><p>&#8220;Earlier findings from the characterization of other types of cancers have given us important clues as to how to design better therapies for these cancers,&#8221; said NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. &#8220;The new results from the TCGA analysis of clear cell renal cell carcinomas provide an explanation for how mutations in certain genes can alter chromosome chemistry to produce changes in enzyme levels that affect cell metabolism in ways correlated with clinical outcomes.&#160; These findings will stimulate some novel ideas about therapies for other lethal cancers.&#8221;</p><p>In addition to the connection between metabolic shift and tumor aggressiveness, TCGA Research Network scientists discovered that, in some cases, the metabolic shift may be caused by changes in the PI3K cellular pathway, which helps regulate cell metabolism. The investigators observed a number of changes in P13K pathway genes and its regulators in tumor cells, including DNA mutations in protein-coding areas, as well as other changes affecting gene expression.&#160; They found such alterations in the PI3K pathway &#8212; or its partner pathways, AKT and mTOR &#8212; in 29 percent of tumor samples. AKT and mTOR also are essential for regulating cellular metabolism.</p><p>The effects of these changes show the importance of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. For example, researchers found a decrease in factors that activate tumor suppressor genes &#8211; the genes that produce proteins aimed at blocking tumor development. At the same time, factors that turned on genes that inhibit the PI3K pathway were blocked. Both of these changes promote activity in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathways. The results suggest the pathways&#8217; potential as therapeutic targets with inhibitor drugs.</p><p>&#8220;These findings illustrate how large, multi-dimensional datasets obtained from the rigorous analyses of hundreds of tumors can be mined to uncover new insights into cancer biology,&#8221; said NHGRI Director Eric Green, M.D., Ph.D. &#8220;By creating these types of datasets, TCGA has advanced our fundamental understanding of this type of cancer.&#8221;</p><p>W. Marston Linehan, M.D., chief of the NCI Urologic Oncology Branch and one of the study&#8217;s leaders, sees several implications from the results. &#8220;The finding of a metabolic shift in the aggressive tumors could provide the foundation for the development of a number of novel approaches to therapy for patients with advanced kidney cancer,&#8221; said Linehan.&#160;</p><p>New therapies are especially important since advanced kidney cancer is often resistant to chemotherapy. TCGA data offer insights into various global processes occurring in kidney cancer and can show how different tumor pathways intersect.</p><p>&#8220;The molecular analysis of this disease impacts understanding of all cancers through furthering insights into the role of metabolic perturbation in malignancy,&#8221; said Richard A. Gibbs, Ph.D., another lead investigator in the project and director of the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine, Houston.</p><p>NCI estimates that nearly 65,000 people in this country will be diagnosed with ccRCC in 2013, and more than 13,000 people will die from the disease. More than 50 percent of patients with early stage renal cell cancer are successfully treated with current therapies. However, nearly all patients with the most severe stage of this cancer have a poor prognosis.</p><p>To date, the TCGA Research Network has generated data and published analyses on glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian serous adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma, invasive breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and endometrial cancer.

It has been previously established that the vaccine prevents genital and anal HPV type 16 and 18 infections and related disease in addition to cervical cancer. Prior to this study, the efficacy of the vaccine against oral HPV infections was unknown. Researchers at NCI, in collaboration with researchers from Costa Rica, showed that the vaccine reduced oral infections by more than 90 percent. The results were published July 17, 2013, in PLOS ONE.</p><p>This study was part of the NCI Costa Rica Vaccine Trial, a randomized clinical trial designed to evaluate vaccine efficacy against cervical HPV16/18 infection and related disease. In 2004-2005, &#160;investigators enrolled 7,466 healthy young women ages 18 to 25 to the trial. The women were assigned to receive either the HPV16/18 vaccine or a control vaccine. Four years after vaccination, study participants provided oral specimens, which allowed researchers to determine whether the vaccine protected against oral HPV infection. The investigators showed that vaccine efficacy against oral HPV16/18 infection was 93 percent (one infection was reported in the HPV vaccine group vs. 15 in the control group). Infections in the oral cavity are less common than in the genital tract, and oral infections only rarely progress to cancer. &#160;According to Aim&#233;e R. Kreimer, Ph.D., NCI, the senior author on this paper, this vaccine is expected to prevent the majority of oral infections and will therefore likely contribute to a reduction in HPV-associated cancers of the oropharynx.</p></div>]]></row>

However, despite many years of research, just exactly how translocations form in a cell has remained a mystery. To better understand this process, the researchers created an experimental system in which they induced, in a controlled fashion, breaks in the DNA of different chromosomes in living cells. Using sophisticated imaging technology, they were then able to watch as the broken ends of the chromosomes were reattached correctly or incorrectly inside the cells.</p><p>Translocations are very rare events, and the scientists&#8217; ability to visualize their occurrence in real time was made possible by recently available technology at NCI that enables investigators to observe changes in thousands of cells over long time periods. &#8220;Our ability to see this fundamental process in cancer formation was possible only because of access to revolutionary imaging technology,&#8221; said the study&#8217;s senior author, Tom Misteli, Ph.D., Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, Center for Cancer Research, NCI.</p><p>The scientists involved with this study were able to demonstrate that translocations can occur within hours of DNA breaks and that their formation is independent of when the breaks happen during the cell division cycle.

<p>In the NCI-sponsored Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT), initial findings from a decade ago showed that the drug finasteride significantly reduced the risk of prostate cancer, but among those who did develop prostate cancer, paradoxically, the drug was associated with an increased risk of high-grade disease. &nbsp;New findings reported in <i>NEJM</i> on August 15, 2013, based on follow-up of trial participants for up to 18 years, showed that survival of the men on finasteride was equivalent to men who did not take the drug and the reduction in risk of prostate cancer persists. &nbsp;Among nearly 19,000 eligible men who underwent randomization, prostate cancer was diagnosed in 10.5 percent of those in the finasteride group and 14.9 percent of those in the placebo group, a 30 percent reduction in risk. For the men diagnosed with prostate cancer, 10-year survival from time of diagnosis was equivalent between study groups overall (78 percent), in those with low-grade cancers (82 percent), and in those with high-grade cancers (73 percent) providing reassurance that the small excess of higher grade tumors in the men in the finasteride arm of the study did not translate into an increased risk of death.<br />&nbsp;<br />Previous studies based on the original 2003 analysis had already suggested that the increase in high-grade disease may have been due to prostate gland shrinkage and increased sensitivity in detecting higher grade cancers. In fact, the PCPT was not designed specifically to address the question of high-grade disease. Since 2011, drugs such as finasteride have had to carry a warning that they may increase the risk of high-grade prostate cancer; they have never been approved for the prevention of the disease. Specifically, there was concern that the increase in high-grade cancers detected among men receiving finasteride would result in more deaths. This new analysis was undertaken, in part, to understand if such concern was warranted.</p>

<p>Leisure-time physical activity is associated with longer life expectancy, even at relatively low levels of activity and regardless of body weight, according to a study by a team of researchers led by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. &nbsp;The study, which found that people who engaged in leisure-time physical activity had life expectancy gains of as much as 4.5 years, appeared Nov. 6, 2012, in <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1001335">PLoS Medicine</a>.</p>
<p>In order to determine the number of years of life gained from leisure-time physical activity in adulthood, which translates directly to an increase in life expectancy, researchers examined data on more than 650,000 adults. These people, mostly age 40 and older, took part in one of six population-based studies that were designed to evaluate various aspects of cancer risk.</p>

<p>The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the parent agency of NIH, <a href="http://www.health.gov/paguidelines/">recommends that adults ages 18 to 64 engage in regular aerobic physical activity</a> for 2.5 hours at moderate intensity&mdash;or 1.25 hours at vigorous intensity&mdash;each week.&nbsp; Moderate activities are those during which a person could talk but not sing. Vigorous activities are those during which a person could say only a few words without stopping for breath.</p>
<p>After accounting for other factors that could affect life expectancy, such as socioeconomic status, the researchers found that life expectancy was 3.4 years longer for people who reported they got the recommend level of physical activity. &nbsp;People who reported leisure-time physical activity at twice the recommended level gained 4.2 years of life.&nbsp; In general, more physical activity corresponded to longer life expectancy.</p>

<p>The researchers even saw benefit at low levels of activity. For example, people who said they got half of the recommended amount of physical activity still added 1.8 years to their life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our findings highlight the important contribution that leisure-time physical activity in adulthood can make to longevity,&rdquo; said study author Steven Moore, Ph.D., of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and lead author of the study.&nbsp; &ldquo;Regular exercise extended the lives in every group that we examined in our study&mdash;normal weight, overweight, or obese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The researchers found that the association between physical activity and life expectancy was similar between men and women, and blacks gained more years of life expectancy than whites. The relationship between life expectancy and physical activity was stronger among those with a history of cancer or heart disease than among people with no history of cancer or heart disease.</p>

<p>The researchers also examined how life expectancy changed with the combination of both activity and obesity.&nbsp; Obesity was associated with a shorter life expectancy, but physical activity helped to mitigate some of the harm. &nbsp;People who were obese and inactive had a life expectancy that was between five to seven years shorter (depending on their level of obesity) than people who were normal weight and moderately active.</p>
<p>Physical activity has been shown to help maintain a healthy body weight, maintain healthy bones, muscles and joints, promote psychological well-being, and reduce the risk of certain diseases, <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=19&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=690&amp;sys_contentid=14469" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" sys_dependentvariantid="690" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="14469" sys_relationshipid="6357696">including some cancers</a>.</p>

<p>NCI scientists have found that a gene, Schlafen-11 (SLFN11), sensitizes cells to substances known to cause irreparable damage to DNA. As part of their study, the researchers used a repository of 60 cell types to identify predictors of cancer cell response to classes of DNA damaging agents, widely used as chemotherapy treatments for many cancers. They found that high SLFN11 expression independently predicted overall survival for a group of ovarian cancer patients who were treated with DNA damaging agents in a NCI clinical trial.

<p>Specifically, to identify potential genes that could predict the toxicity of DNA damaging agents, the scientists correlated the expression of more than 17,000 genes from the <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=333101&amp;sys_revision=11&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="333101" sys_dependentvariantid="704" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="6211429">NCI-60 (a 60 cell line panel used to screen for, and characterize, novel anticancer drugs)</a>, with the activity of four different topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors. As a result, they identified SLFN11 as the single gene to show a highly significant positive correlation in all of the tested Top1 inhibitors. After finding this key gene for Top1 inhibitors, the scientists expanded their analysis to 1,444 other compounds commonly tested in the NCI-60, many with known mechanisms of action and routinely used in clinical practice. The scientists consistently observed significant positive correlations of SLFN11 expression, not only with Top1 inhibitors, but with other classes of DNA damaging agents including cisplatin, doxorubicin and etoposide. As a secondary check on their clinical findings, the researchers conducted laboratory tests on cancer cells from various tumor tissue types where it was known that SLFN11 expression was silenced, and cell death or cell cycle arrest occurred in response to numerous DNA damaging agents. The results of these studies further supported SLFN11 as a gene warranting continued investigational interest.</p>

Immunotherapy works by boosting the body&#8217;s immune system, or by using immune cells to attack specific types of cancer cells. The success of this treatment for melanoma, and all forms of cancer, is contingent upon finding protein targets that are overexpressed, or highly active, on cancerous tumor cells, but have limited expression in normal tissue. The seven gene targets identified in this work meet these criteria. The results of this study, headed by Richard A. Morgan, Ph.D., Surgery Branch, Tumor Immunology Section, Center for Cancer Research at NCI, appeared Sept. 10, 2013, in <i>Clinical Cancer Research.</i></p><p>Morgan and his colleagues designed a set of genetic probes that contained 97 genes, 72 of which were considered potential candidate genes for immunotherapy, to look for new therapeutic targets in melanoma. Each of these genetic probes had a unique fluorescent bar code that permitted the NCI research team to accurately count individual RNA molecules. Using this probe set on 59 melanoma tumor samples, the researchers isolated RNA, which is the genetic material that codes for proteins, and counted each time a specific gene bar code was observed. As a result of this experiment, the scientists concluded that of 72 potential target genes, 33 were overexpressed in more than 20 percent of the melanoma tumor samples. Twenty of those genes were identified as being expressed in different manners between tumor samples and normal tissue. Based on this analysis, the researchers concluded that seven genes warrant further consideration as potential immunotherapy targets: <i>CSAG2, MAGEA3, MAGEC2, IL13RA2, PRAME, CSPG4,</i> and <i>SOX10</i>, because they were found to be highly overexpressed in a large percent of the tumor samples but had limited expression in normal tissues.</p></div>]]></row>

Prior to this work, the relationship between glucose metabolism and memory T cells, which play a major role in cellular immunity, was unclear. Investigating the mechanism of glucose metabolism in CD8+ T cells, whose role is to destroy virally infected cells or tumor cells, the scientists found that varying levels of glucose acted as a metabolic regulator in whether or not the cells became more specialized.</p><p>The scientists&#8217; conclusion was supported by three main lines of evidence. First, activated CD8+ T cells experienced a divergent fate when transplanted into live mice and sorted based on differences in glucose metabolism. CD8+ T cells that displayed high glucose activity tended to be short-lived, while those with a low glucose metabolism established immunological memory and hence the ability to rapidly mount an immune defense if reinfection occurs. Second, forcing higher glucose metabolic levels severely impaired the ability of CD8+ T cells to persist and form memory in the mice. Third, and most important, specific drug inhibition of glucose metabolism with 2-deoxyglucose enhanced the ability of CD8+ T cells to become long-lived memory cells. These findings may have important implications for T cell-based therapies and vaccines for cancer and infectious diseases, since they indicate that drug targeting of metabolic pathways during the initial stages of T cell activation may enhance CD8+ T cell immunity, and hence greater overall cellular health.

They found that these break sites correlate with damage often seen in B cell cancers, such as diffuse large B cell lymphoma. All cells undergo DNA replication, a process where the cell copies its entire genome before cell division. Some genes that comprise DNA strands increase the risk for cancer, induce replication stress, and result in a higher likelihood of cells acquiring DNA damage, such as breaks. Replication stress may be one of the earliest events leading to genome instability that can cause cancer. This study is the first to describe an underlying mechanism of genome instability in B cell cancers that could not previously be explained. This research was headed by Andre Nussenzweig, Ph.D., chief of the Laboratory of Genome Integrity, Center for Cancer Research, NCI. &#160;Results of this finding appeared in <i>Cell</i>, Jan. 31, 2013<i>.</i></p><p>Nussenzweig and collaborators wanted to find if there were specific places within a cell&#8217;s DNA that were more difficult to copy and, as a result, caused DNA breaks. They used the mouse immune system as a model, isolated healthy cells, and then monitored the cells for initiation of DNA damage in order to understand how a healthy cell mutated. Proteins that repair the damage by binding to the affected DNA sites were mapped, using genome-wide sequencing techniques. The scientists then compared the DNA damage sites in their mouse model with sites mutated in human diffuse large B cell lymphoma tissue samples, providing important evidence that both mouse and human cells exhibit similar trends of genome instability. As a result, their findings in mice may be important in B cell lymphoma initiation and progression in humans. As a next step, the investigators will begin mapping the DNA damage induced by replication in other cell types to learn if they too are involved in cancer progression.</p></div>]]></row>

The checklist focuses on tests that are based on complex mathematical models incorporating large numbers of measurements from so-called &#8220;omics&#8221; assays. &#8220;Omics&#8221; refers to the comprehensive study of sets of related molecules, such as genes, proteins, or metabolites, in a biological sample.</p><p>The checklist will be used to guide all relevant NCI-supported clinical trials and is recommended for use in trials funded by others.&#160; The criteria on the checklist cover issues relating to specimens, assays, mathematical modeling, and clinical trial design, along with related ethical, legal, and regulatory matters. &#160;It is hoped that the criteria will help guide investigators toward the use of best practices in the development of omics tests and their use in clinical trials. The checklist article and a related explanation and elaboration were published <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>in <i>Nature</i> and <i>BMC Medicine</i>, respectively, on Oct. 17, 2013.</p><p>Today&#8217;s omics technologies can provide detailed characterization of disease states and have the potential to predict&#160; clinical outcomes more accurately and indicate which therapies are most likely to be beneficial. These technologies are being used particularly often in oncology because cancers are known to be driven by mutations and other molecular changes that can be detected with omics methods.&#160; However, the heterogeneous nature of cancer presents difficulties in detection of cancers, determination of prognosis, and selection of therapy.&#160; Although a few omics-based predictor models have become clinically useful tests, turning an omics assay from a test that is useful in research into a test acceptable for clinical use requires a rigorous development and validation process, with attention to the complexities of omics assays and their application to clinical specimens. Specialized expertise is required to develop and evaluate appropriate mathematical predictor models built from complex, multi-variable data and to address numerous ethical, legal, and regulatory issues.</p><p>Some omics-based tests have been advanced prematurely for use in trials to guide decisions about patient treatment. These situations led to calls for examination of the field of translational omics. Building on recommendations from an Institute of Medicine study (see <a href="http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx">http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2012/Evolution-of-Translational-Omics.aspx</a>), NCI and its collaborators developed 30 criteria that should be addressed to determine the readiness of an omics test for use in a prospective clinical trial. These criteria apply to any clinical trial involving the investigational use of an omics test that will influence decisions about the clinical management of patients in the trial. An example of such a decision would be a preference for a particular type of therapy. The criteria are intended to apply not only to evaluation of the strength of evidence in support of an omics test, but also the practical issues that must be considered before the test is used in a clinical setting.</p><p>Although it is not expected that exploratory studies using omics assays, or studies conducted in the early stages of omics test development, will meet all of the criteria, the checklist should be broadly useful as a convenient framework with which to assess the stage of development of an omics test and the strength and quality of the accumulated evidence that supports its use.</p><p>&#8220;Our ultimate goal in creating this checklist is to develop a more efficient, reliable, and transparent process to move omics assays from promising research results to clinically useful tests that improve patient care and outcomes,&#8221; said Lisa McShane, Ph.D., Biometric Research Branch, NCI, and first author on both articles.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p><p>&#160;</p><p><b>References:</b></p><p>Lisa M.

When the spike is bound to receptors on the cell&#8217;s surface and becomes activated the outer portions of the spike swivel away from the helix bundle. This rearrangement allows the spike to begin the process of HIV infection.&#160;This model for the activation of the HIV spike is similar to that of other enveloped viruses such as influenza.

<p>NCI scientists report that two doses of a human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, trademarked as Cervarix, resulted in similar serum antibody levels against two of the most carcinogenic types of HPV (16 and 18), compared to a standard three dose regimen. Among women who received only one dose, antibody levels were also high and remained stable four years after vaccination. The results suggest that fewer doses of an HPV vaccine may confer necessary long-term protection against new infection and appeared Nov. 4, 2013, in <i>Cancer Prevention Research</i>.</p>
<p>Mahboobeh Safaeian, Ph.D., an investigator in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics at NCI, and her colleagues, measured HPV antibody levels in women enrolled in the NCI Costa Rica Vaccine Trial. Previously, data from this trial demonstrated vaccine efficacy against new persistent HPV16/18 infections, for two vaccine doses which was comparable to a standard three doses. In this latest study, investigators compared the level and duration of antibody response in three groups of women vaccinated with one, two or three doses of Cervarix. They also measured immune responses of unvaccinated women who, at enrollment, were found to have existing antibody levels, presumably from past HPV infection. Women who received just one dose had&nbsp;lower antibody levels against HPV 16/18, compared to women who received all three doses, and their levels remained stable from six to 48 months after vaccination. If these findings are confirmed by other studies, they would potentially affect cost and logistics of vaccination programs in low-resource settings, where more than 85 percent of cervical cancers&mdash;the most common cause of cancer death in these women&mdash;occur.</p>

<p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) was the first cancer type to be systematically studied by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network (TCGA) in 2008. In a new, complementary report, TCGA experts examined more than 590 GBM samples--the largest to date utilizing genomic characterization techniques and nearly 400 more than were examined in 2008--to identify several additional significantly mutated genes in GBM implicated in the regulation of chromatin modification. Chromatin is a combination of DNA and protein within a cell&rsquo;s nucleus that is involved in regulating how genes are expressed.</p>
<p>GBM, the type of brain cancer most often found in adults, is a fast-growing and often fatal tumor. More than 23,000 new cases of brain cancer are predicted in the United States in 2013, with more than 14,000 people likely to die from the disease. Most patients with GBM die of the disease within approximately 15 months of diagnosis.</p>
<p>TCGA is a collaborative effort jointly funded and managed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&nbsp; These new findings appeared October 10, 2013, in the journal Cell.</p>
<p>TCGA was established to generate a comprehensive catalogue of non-heritable genomic changes in over 25 different types of cancer. The initial observations in GBM provided a proof-of-concept that systematic genomic analyses could define core biological pathways, substantiate previous smaller-study observations and generate unanticipated insights.</p>
<p>At the start of the TCGA program, only several hundred GBM tumor samples were available for analysis, and technology to probe those samples was comparatively rudimentary. Since the inaugural TCGA publication on GBM, advances in genomic characterization technology have transformed the ability to characterize gene alterations with greater resolution and accuracy. For example, massively parallel sequencing technology that is able to read over 100 million sequences of DNA at a time is now part of the standard toolkit for characterization of tumors. Subsequent to the GBM study in 2008, TCGA has used these and newer technologies to describe the landscape of alterations in eight other tumor types.</p>
<p>This new research applied the advanced technologies to a larger set of high-quality samples.&nbsp; The report describes the identification of novel, significantly mutated genes in GBM, including <i>LZTR1, ATRX, KEL</i> and <i>QKI</i>, and revealed a pattern of mutations, not attributable to chance, among genes implicated in regulation of chromatin modification. Additionally, sequencing of whole genomes and messenger RNA detected several new mechanisms; one that changes the structure of the gene <i>EGFR</i>; one that reorganizes a region on chromosome 12 that contains the oncogenes <i>MDM2</i> and <i>CDK4</i>; as well as detecting the presence of highly frequent point mutations, or a substitution of one base for another among the four bases that comprise DNA, in a non-coding region of the <i>TERT</i> gene.</p>
<p>The 2008 GBM study found biologically-relevant alterations in three core pathways. Additional research efforts to link these alterations to distinct subtypes of glioblastoma revealed that coordinated combinations of these alterations were enriched in different subtypes of the disease. In 2013, it is now evident that glioblastoma growth is driven by large signaling networks that have a functional redundancy that permit adaptation of the tumor in response to targeted molecular treatments. For example, the vast majority of GBM tumors have at least one known driver mutation in the PI3K pathway and close to half exhibit two or more such mutations.&nbsp; Thus, this new study provides a greatly needed comprehensive catalogue of molecular alterations in glioblastoma.</p>
<p>Additionally, based on integration of genomic alterations with metabolic activity, researchers demonstrated non-linear relationships between genomic alterations and signaling activities, challenging the concept of therapeutic inhibition of pathway components being equivalent to direct targeting of the mutated gene itself.&nbsp; &ldquo;While this presents new challenges for therapies, it also provides an important understanding of how to develop better and more appropriately targeted drugs in the future,&rdquo; said lead author Lynda Chin, M.D., <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and the Broad Institute of MITand Harvard University Cambridge, Mass.</p>

The analysis suggests information about other risk factors, including family medical history, would be needed to enhance the broader utility of these models.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>Two studies from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) program reveal details about the genomic landscapes of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and endometrial cancer. Both provide new insights into the molecular underpinnings of these cancers with the potential to improve treatment.&nbsp; These studies represent the sixth and seventh in a series of genomes of at least 20 major cancers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>The first study is on endometrial cancer:</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Study establishes basis for genomic classification of endometrial cancers;</b> <i>proper categorization is important for choosing the best treatment</i></p>
<p>A comprehensive genomic analysis of nearly 400 endometrial tumors suggests that certain molecular characteristics &ndash; such as the frequency of mutations &ndash; could complement current pathology methods and help distinguish between principal types of endometrial tumors, as well as provide insights into potential treatment strategies. &nbsp;In addition, the study, led by investigators in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, revealed four novel tumor subtypes, while also identifying genomic similarities between endometrial and other types of cancers, including breast, ovarian, and colorectal cancers.</p>
<p>These findings represent the most comprehensive characterization of the molecular alterations in endometrial cancers available to date. They were published May 2, 2013, in the journal Nature. TCGA is funded and managed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With this latest study in a series of 20 planned TCGA tumor type characterizations, more genomic similarities are emerging between disparate tumor types,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.&nbsp; &ldquo;Teasing out heretofore unknown genomic markers or mutations in various cancers is again proving the value of TCGA.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Clinically, endometrial cancers fall into two categories: endometrioid (type I) and serous (type II) tumors. Type I is correlated with excess estrogen, obesity, and a favorable prognosis, while type II is more common in older women and generally has a less favorable outcome. Type I tumors are often treated with radiation therapy, which helps stop or slow cancer growth, given in addition to or after the primary treatment. Type II tumors are generally treated with chemotherapy, in which drugs are used to kill the cancer cells or stop them from growing.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Distinguishing between different types of endometrial cancers is currently based on histology, an examination of a thin slice of tissue under a microscope. But categorizing endometrial cancer tissues is often difficult, and specialists frequently disagree on the classification of individual cases.</p>
<p>In this study, investigators showed that approximately 25 percent of tumors that pathologists classified as high-grade endometrioid showed frequent mutations in TP53, a tumor suppressor gene, as well as extensive copy number alterations, a term for when a cell has too many or too few copies of a genomic segment. Both are key molecular characteristics associated with serous tumors, along with a small number of DNA methylation changes, which are additions of a basic chemical unit to pieces of DNA. Most endometrioid tumors, by contrast, have few copy number alterations or mutations in TP53, though there are&nbsp; frequent mutations in other well known cancer-associated genes, including PTEN, another tumor suppressor gene, and KRAS, a gene involved in regulating cell division.</p>
<p>These data suggest that some high grade endometrioid tumors have developed a strikingly similar pattern of alterations to serous tumors, and may benefit from a similar course of treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study highlights the fact that some tumors with the same characterization by pathologists may have very different molecular features. That&rsquo;s where these findings will be directly implemented in additional research, and also in the context of clinical trials,&rdquo; said Douglas A. Levine, M.D., head of the Gynecology Research Laboratory at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, and a co-leader in the study.</p>
<p>According to the authors, the new findings provide a roadmap for future clinical trials for endometrial cancer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Each tumor subtype might warrant dedicated clinical trials because of the marked genomic differences between them that are indicative of different drivers of cancer,&rdquo; said study co-leader Elaine Mardis, Ph.D., co-director of the Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis. &nbsp;&ldquo;Developing therapies for each subtype independent of the other may improve outcomes, as has been shown in breast cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Investigators also found genomic similarities between endometrial cancers and other tumor types.&nbsp; Previous TCGA research showed that a form of ovarian cancer (high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma) and a subtype of breast cancer (basal-like breast cancer) share many genomic features. In this study, the scientists found that endometrial serous carcinoma also has some of these same genomic characteristics. The cancers share a high frequency of mutations in TP53 (between 84 and 96 percent) and a low frequency in PTEN, with only 1 to 2 percent mutated. Surprisingly, the researchers also found many shared characteristics between endometrioid tumors and colorectal tumors. Both cancer types demonstrate a high frequency of microsatellite instability, where the repair mechanism for DNA is broken, and mutations in POLE, a gene responsible for producing a protein involved in DNA replication and repair. These genomic changes led to high mutation rates in both tumor types.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TCGA&rsquo;s multidimensional approach to collecting genomic data, including clinical and pathology information, have made these findings possible,&rdquo; said Harold Varmus, M.D., NCI director. &ldquo;Without the integrated characterization of so many tumor samples, correlations between histology and genomic data may not have been observed or potential clinical outcomes identified.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With a complete analysis of the study&rsquo;s findings, investigators have identified four novel genomic-based subtypes of endometrial cancer, which may set the stage for new diagnostic and treatment approaches. Each of the four genomic subtypes clustered together and was named for one of its notable characteristics:&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>The POLE ultramutated group was named for its unusually high mutation rates and hotspot mutations (sequences highly susceptible to mutation) in the POLE gene. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The hypermutated microsatellite instability group exhibited a high mutation rate, as well as few copy number alterations, but did not carry mutations in the POLE gene.</li>
<li>The copy number low group showed the greatest microsatellite stability but a high frequency of mutations in CTNNB1, a gene critical for maintaining the linings of organs, such as the endometrium. &nbsp;</li>
<li>The copy number high subtype was composed of mostly serous tumors, but included some endometrioid samples. This subtype displayed copy number alterations and a mutation landscape that was characteristic of serous tumors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Endometrial cancer is the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer among women in the United States. NCI estimates that close to 50,000 women will be diagnosed with endometrial cancer in 2013, with more than an estimated 8,000 deaths from the disease. For a majority of patients diagnosed with aggressive, high grade tumors with metastases, the five-year survival rate is about 16 percent, though chemotherapy has been associated with an improvement in survival, and new targeted agents are being tested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Finding genomic similarities among types of breast, ovarian, endometrial and colorectal tumors once again reveals that cancer, although very complex, may have themes extending beyond tissue type that can be exploited for therapeutic benefit,&rdquo; said Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D., NHGRI director. &ldquo;These similar genomic features demonstrate hitherto unknown commonalities among these cancers.</p>
<p>To date, the TCGA Research Network has generated data and published analyses on glioblastoma multiforme, ovarian serous adenocarcinoma, colorectal adenocarcinoma, lung squamous cell carcinoma and invasive breast cancer. Data generated by TCGA are freely available at the TCGA Data Portal and CGHub.</p>

<p><b><i>The second study is on acute myeloid leukemia:</i></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>TCGA researchers identify potential drug targets, markers for leukemia risk;</b> <i>New study reveals relatively few mutations in AML genomes</i></p>
<p>Investigators for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have detailed and broadly classified the genomic alterations that frequently underlie the development of acute myeloid leukemia (AML), a deadly cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Their work paints a picture of a cancer marked by relatively few mutations compared to other types of cancer occurring in adults. They also found that AML is powerfully influenced by mutations in genes that cause epigenetic changes (chemical changes to the genome that do not change the DNA nucleotide sequence) that can affect the expression of genes. TCGA is jointly supported and managed by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), both part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>The findings, which appeared online May 1, 2013, in the New England Journal of Medicine set the stage for identifying potential new drug targets and treatment strategies for AML. They may also offer better guidance for predicting the severity of disease for individual patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results provide important new insights into the genomics of a deadly and difficult-to-treat cancer, and underscore the power and scope of The Cancer Genome Atlas project,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather than just random snapshots about individual patients, this study provides a more detailed look at the aberrant genomes of AML than we have ever had before,&rdquo; said NHGRI Director Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D. &ldquo;It has the potential to open up new directions in AML research, and perhaps, in the design of new therapeutics, its impact could be felt in the near future.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>AML, the most common acute form of adult leukemia, develops when immature white blood cells fail to mature and instead accumulate in the bone marrow. The leukemia cells reduce the production of healthy blood cells, leading to anemia, abnormal bleeding and infections, and, if untreated, death.</p>
<p>Researchers examined the genomes of tumor specimens from 200 adult cases of spontaneously occurring, newly diagnosed AML.&nbsp; These cases represented all of the known subtypes of AML in approximately the same proportion as the general population. In this way, the study provided a realistic view of the disease, particularly in the number and frequency of genomic alterations. Each AML genome was compared to the normal genome derived from a skin sample of the same patient. Out of the 200 samples, 50 were analyzed by using whole genome sequencing, which is an examination of the complete DNA blueprint of the cells. Researchers analyzed the genome&rsquo;s protein-coding regions in the remaining samples, and used powerful new sequencing methods to look at changes in RNA in each case.</p>
<p>By studying a large number of AML cases, investigators were able to predict that they have identified virtually all of the mutations that occur in at least 5 percent of AML patients. Surprisingly, they found that overall, AML genomes have relatively few mutations, and such tumors are among the least mutated adult cancers. The average number of mutations in genes for each AML genome was 13, in contrast to solid tumors such as breast, lung or pancreatic cancer, which often have hundreds of mutated genes.</p>
<p>Because investigators found more than 1,600 genes that were mutated at least once in the 200 samples, they organized the recurrently mutated genes into nine categories based on their function or the known pathways involved. Some of these categories include tumor suppressor genes, signaling genes and epigenetic modifiers, with the latter being the most frequently mutated class of genes in the study. Epigenetic changes are alterations to DNA that often involve the addition or removal of chemical tags (such as methyl groups), which can affect when genes are turned on and off.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This data set helps to integrate what was previously fragmented information,&rdquo; said study co-leader Timothy J. Ley, M.D., associate director for cancer genomics at The Genome Institute at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. &ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t realize how few recurrent mutations there were, and no one was thinking even five years ago that AML was associated with a high frequency of mutations in genes that encode epigenetic modifiers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>By finding comparatively few recurrently mutated genes, yet frequent alterations in genes that help control gene expression, the investigators may have narrowed the search for likely drug targets and disease markers.</p>
<p>Other results were also somewhat surprising. Researchers knew that mutations in signaling genes, which help control cell growth and development, were very common in AML, and thought that all AML samples may have at least one signaling gene mutation. But the TCGA findings showed that these genes are mutated in only 60 percent of cases. These include mutations in the gene FLT3, which occur in about a third of cases, making it one of the most commonly mutated genes in AML. FLT3 is important for normal blood cell development. The researchers also found that many AML patients have concurrent mutations in three commonly mutated genes: FLT3, NPM1 and DNMT3A. Patients with this combination of gene mutations appear to have a unique subtype of AML.</p>
<p>Investigators unexpectedly found recurring mutations in cohesin genes, which are important in cell division.</p>
<p>The study is the first to report a recurrently mutated microRNA gene in AML. MicroRNAs can play an important role in regulating gene expression, particularly in turning off gene activity.</p>
<p>Abnormal chromosome rearrangements and gene fusions (where two genes join to form a new, altered gene) are frequently useful in diagnosing and providing prognostic information for AML patients. The study uncovered many such fusions that had not been described before, and nearly half of the AML samples were found to have gene fusions.</p>
<p>Currently, only a few good markers exist to help guide treatment decisions for the majority of patients with intermediate risk. Some of the recurrently mutated genes identified in this study may allow for better prognostic information that will be relevant for AML patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve never had such a complete picture of AML, and this data set will be mined by researchers for years,&rdquo; said co-study leader Richard Wilson, Ph.D., director of Washington University&rsquo;s Genome Institute. &ldquo;These findings have probably identified every pathway in which a modification &ndash; and perhaps new drugs &ndash; might be beneficial. They also further refine our understanding of the importance of individual mutations for disease classification and prognostication, and will help us build better disease models.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These results will enable investigators to examine patient samples for mutation patterns and affected pathways, and to begin new studies to try to understand the relationships between these genetic mutations and treatment results,&rdquo; added Ley.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study of AML reinforces the value of the approach we are using to study the genomic diversity among tumors of&nbsp;&nbsp; many different cancer types and even within a single kind of cancer such as AML,&rdquo; noted NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. &ldquo;Only such a systematic analysis of cancer types could have uncovered such clear patterns, such as the apparent importance in AML of genetic mutations that lead to changes in gene expression and cell traits.&rdquo;</p>

  	</div><p>Gut commensal microbiota are microorganisms that live in the gut and thrive but do not affect their host, in this case laboratory mice. Humans also harbor gut commensal microbiota that can influence local and body-wide inflammation as well as modify the tumor microenvironment, which consists of cells, signaling molecules and mechanisms that may support tumor growth and also cause drug resistance.</p><p>To study the importance of commensal bacteria, the scientists used mice raised in sterile conditions from birth so they did not harbor any bacteria, or alternatively, conventionally raised mice that received a potent antibiotic cocktail that is known to decrease bacteria by more than 10,000&#8211;fold. &#160;The mice received these antibiotics in their drinking water, starting three weeks prior to tumor inoculation. T <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>hey continued to receive doses of the antibiotic cocktail throughout the experiment.</p><p>To analyze tumors at comparable stages of progression, lymphoma, colon, and melanoma cancers that could be transplanted were selected, based on their susceptibility to therapeutic drugs. Cancer cells from these tumors were then injected under the skin of the mice, where they formed tumors that grew to reach a diameter of one-fifth of an inch or more. The tumors were then treated with an immunotherapy that included CpG-oligonucleotides, which stimulated the immune system, or with the chemotherapy drugs oxaliplatin and cisplatin, which attacked the tumors.</p><p>Germ-free mice, or mice that received the antibiotic cocktail, responded poorly to drug therapy for their tumors. This resulted in a lower production of cytokines (proteins secreted by lymph cells that affects cellular activity and controls inflammation) as well as lower tumor death therefore demonstrating that optimal responses to cancer therapy required an intact commensal microbiota.&#160;</p><p>In an independent co-submitted study that will appear in the same issue of Science, Laurence Zitvogel, M.D., Ph.D., Gustave Roussy Institute, Paris, and colleagues showed that a different type of chemotherapy drug, cyclophosphamide, altered the composition of the intestinal microbiota and damaged the intestinal wall, thereby affecting optimal anti-tumor immune response and the therapeutic effectiveness of cyclophosphamide. &#160;</p><p>&#8220;The use of antibiotics should be considered as an important element affecting microbiota composition. It has been demonstrated, and our present study has confirmed, that after antibiotic treatment the bacterial composition in the gut never returns to its initial composition,&#8221; said Trinchieri. &#8220;Thus, our findings raise the possibility that the frequent use of antibiotics during a patient&#8217;s lifetime or to treat infections related to cancer and its side-effects may affect the success of anti-cancer therapy.&#8221;</p><p>In next steps, Goldszmid and Trinchieri will work in mice to fully characterize the molecular signaling by which the bacteria in the gut can actually send messages to distant organs or tumors and change the type and level of inflammation present in those organs. They also plan to characterize, in humans, the role of gut bacteria on the bodies&#8217; inflammatory response and tumor response to therapy. Additionally, the researchers plan to design clinical studies by giving antibiotics to healthy volunteers to study their effect on the molecular mechanisms regulating inflammation.</p><p align="center"># # #</p><p><b>Reference:</b> Iida N., et al.

Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Surgery Branch, NCI, who is the principle investigator in the first study noted. These reports represent important advances in the understanding of gene therapy for treatment of advanced blood-borne cancers. &#160;In the first study (Effective Treatment of Chemotherapy-Refractory Diffuse Large B Cell Lymphoma With Autologous T Cells Genetically-Engineered to Express An Anti-CD19 Chimeric Antigen Receptor [#62867]), 15 adult patients had their T cells removed, were treated with chemotherapy, and then were given an infusion of their own T cells which had been genetically modified in the lab. The first report of the success of this type of therapy in lymphomas came in 2010 by Kochenderfer and Rosenberg in a patient who remains progression-free over 42 months after treatment.&#160; This team has now demonstrated that this same approach is effective in patients with diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Six patients in the trial achieved complete remission and six achieved partial remission. This approach offers an option for patients with chemotherapy-resistant large B-cell cancer who are not good candidates for other forms of stem cell transplantation. The Chimeric Antigen Receptor CD 19 technology is being co-developed with Kite Pharma Inc. under a cooperative research and development agreement with NCI&#8217;s surgery branch.</p><p>In the second study (Donor-Derived Anti-CD19 Chimeric-Antigen-Receptor-Expressing T Cells Cause Regression of Malignancy Persisting After Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation [#59886]), researchers used genetically modified T cells to treat B-cell cancers, such as leukemia and lymphoma, that did not fully respond to transplantation of stem cells from a donor. The study enrolled 10 patients who received no treatment except one infusion of genetically modified T cells that were obtained from related or unrelated stem cell transplant donors. Three of 10 patients experienced significant disease regression, with one patient showing complete remission.&#160; Significantly, none of the patients experienced graft-versus-host disease (GVHD).&#160; Toxicities were mild, and resolved within two weeks. The results are encouraging because they show that small numbers of modified T cells can cause regression of highly treatment-resistant B-cell cancers without causing GVHD.&#160; This finding indicates a possible new treatment approach for patients with aggressive forms of these cancers that have proven resistant to other treatment approaches, including stem cell transplantation from donors.</p></div>]]></row>

  	</div><p>The independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee overseeing the trial had recommended to the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of NIH, that the study results be made public in December 2013 because a planned interim analysis showed the prolongation in overall survival. Details from this early analysis were announced in December 2013 and the more complete data were presented at ASCO June 1, 2014.</p><p>The study enrolled 790 men with metastatic prostate cancer between July 2006 and November 2012 in a trial known as E3805. All patients started treatment by receiving a form of hormone therapy known as ADT (androgen deprivation therapy). The backbone to this therapy is suppression of testosterone. Androgens like testosterone regulate male sex characteristics and can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cells.</p><p>Men received either ADT alone or ADT with the chemotherapy drug docetaxel every three weeks over a period of 18 weeks. In addition to examining whether the study participants lived longer with the addition of chemotherapy, investigators looked at whether the extent of a patient&#8217;s metastatic disease was high or low at the start of treatment. Approximately two thirds of patients had a high extent of metastatic disease which, according to the study, meant the cancer had spread to major organs such as the liver, or had spread to four or more bone sites, or both.</p><p>A significant improvement in overall survival was noted favoring the participants who received docetaxel chemotherapy in addition to ADT compared to those who only received ADT. Half of the patients were alive at 57.6 months with the use of early chemotherapy with ADT versus half who were alive at 44.0 months with ADT alone. Further analysis showed that patients with a high extent of metastatic disease accounted for most of the overall survival with docetaxel plus ADT (half were alive 49.2 months later with chemo-hormonal therapy versus half who were alive 32.2 months later with ADT alone). Additionally, the median time to clinical progression of the cancer was 32.7 months for men who received docetaxel plus ADT compared with 19.8 months for ADT alone. The follow-up data reported at ASCO was through mid-January of 2014.</p><p>Since docetaxel has been shown in previous clinical trials to be beneficial in men with prostate cancer that is growing despite suppressed testosterone, and is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of this later-stage disease, it is currently commercially available for use. However, because docetaxel is a chemotherapy drug associated with some toxicities, the benefit-to-risk ratio for its early use in combination with ADT is clearly in favor of offering it to patients with high-extent metastatic prostate cancer who are candidates for <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>treatment with docetaxel, according to the trial investigators. This is the group of patients who experienced the most benefit in the current analysis. Further follow-up will be performed on patients with less extensive metastatic disease who participated in E3805 in order to define the effect of this treatment combination on these patients.</p><p>&#8220;The results of this study are practice-changing,&#8221; said lead investigator Christopher Sweeney, M.B.B.S., Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston. &#8220;We have strong scientific evidence that patients with the most advanced metastatic prostate cancer benefit from the early addition of docetaxel to testosterone suppression and not waiting until the cancer has progressed with suppressed testosterone therapy. The findings of this study are important both for improving the clinical care we deliver now and in designing new clinical trials as we strive to further improve the lives of men with metastatic prostate cancer.&#8221;</p><p>E3805 was sponsored by NCI and was designed and conducted by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group in collaboration with SWOG, Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, and NRG Oncology. Sanofi, Paris, the drug manufacturer, provided the docetaxel and supported this study under a Clinical Trials Agreement with ECOG-ACRIN.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;This trial would not have been done in the United States without a large national network of investigators brought together through the NCI-supported Cooperative Group program that was capable of rapidly enrolling many patients,&#8221; said Jeff Abrams, M.D., clinical director of NCI&#8217;s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. &#8220;Additionally, these findings are an example of how combining two approved and available treatments can produce a significant improvement in clinical outcome.</p><p>It is estimated that over 233,000 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States in 2014 and over 29,000 men will die of the disease.</p><p align="center"># # #</p><p><b>Reference:</b> E3805: CHAARTED: ChemoHormonal Therapy Versus Androgen Ablation Randomized Trial for Extensive Disease in Prostate Cancer.

</div>
<p>The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, covering the period 1975&ndash;2010, showed death rates for lung cancer, which accounts for more than one in four cancer deaths, dropping at a faster pace than in previous years. The recent larger drop in lung cancer deaths is likely the result of decreased cigarette smoking prevalence over many years, and is now being reflected in mortality trends.&nbsp; The lung cancer death rate decline, as well as declines in colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer death rates, has also helped drive decreases in death rates for all cancers types combined, a trend that began about 20 years ago. The decreased death rates for these four cancers accounted for more than two-thirds of the overall reduction in cancer death rates in the period 2001-2010. The report showed, however, that death rates increased for some cancers, including cancers of the liver and pancreas for both sexes, cancers of the uterus in women, and, in men only, melanoma of the skin and cancers of the soft tissue in this 10 year period.</p>
<p>The special feature of this year&rsquo;s Report highlights the prevalence of other disease conditions, (diabetes, chronic lung disease, cardiovascular disease, and 13 others) in cancer patients over 65 years of age, and how they affect survival. &nbsp;Studying comorbid conditions is especially important because cancer is primarily a disease of aging and the prevalence of comorbidities also increases with age.&nbsp; Comorbidity is defined as having two or more medical conditions at the same time.&nbsp; The report shows that one-third of patients in this study population have comorbidities, with a higher frequency of comorbidities in patients with lung or colorectal cancer, and that survival is influenced by the presence of other medical conditions as well as the type of cancer, stage at diagnosis, and age.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Report, produced annually since 1998, is co-authored by researchers from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) which is part of the National Institutes of Health; the American Cancer Society (ACS); the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR).It appeared online in the journal <i>Cancer</i> on Dec. 16, 2013.</p>
<p><b>Death Rates</b></p>
<p>The latest Report includes mortality data through 2010, the most recent year for which complete data are available.&nbsp; It found that from 2001 through 2010, death rates for all cancers combined decreased by 1.8 percent per year among men and by 1.4 percent per year among women. Death rates among children 14 years of age and younger decreased by 1.9 percent per year. Death rates among men decreased for 11 of the 17 most common cancers (lung, prostate, colon and rectum, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, esophagus, kidney, stomach, myeloma, oral cavity and pharynx, and larynx) and increased for melanoma of the skin, soft tissue cancers, and cancers of the pancreas and liver.&nbsp; During the same 10 year period, death rates among women decreased for 15 of the 18 most common cancers (lung, breast, colon and rectum, ovary, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, brain, myeloma, kidney, stomach, cervix, bladder, esophagus, oral cavity and pharynx, and gallbladder) and increased for cancers of the uterus, pancreas, and liver.</p>
<p>The Report found that lung cancer death rates for men dropped 1.9 percent per year during the period 1993-2005 and fell by 2.9 percent per year from 2005-2010.&nbsp; For women, rates declined 1.4 percent per year during the period 2004-2010, which was a turnaround from an increase of 0.3 percent per year during the period 1995-2004.&nbsp; These shifts have been attributed to many factors that have reduced the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the United States. Of particular note is the smaller drop in lung cancer death rates for women, most probably due to a later decline in cigarette smoking rates among females.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The sustained fall in death rates for most cancers is an important indicator of our success in controlling this large set of complex diseases but is not as fast as we&rsquo;d like,&rdquo; said NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. &ldquo;In addition, the Report emphasizes the need to consider the entire health status of cancer patients since many have other significant medical conditions that may affect their survival.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Incidence Rates</b></p>
<p>Cancer incidence rates, which track new cases, can vary based on a number of factors and are considered an important measure of disease burden, whereas mortality is the primary measure of progress in cancer control.&nbsp; Incidence rates may presage changes in mortality outcomes however.&nbsp;&nbsp; During the period of 2001-2010, overall cancer incidence rates decreased by 0.6 percent per year among men, were stable among women, and increased by 0.8 percent per year among children (ages 0 through 14 years), continuing trends from recent Annual Reports. During the 2001-2010 time period, incidence rates decreased for six of the 17 most common cancers among men (prostate, lung, colon and rectum, stomach, larynx, and brain and other nervous systems) and increased for eight others (kidney, pancreas, liver, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, thyroid, leukemia, melanoma of the skin, and myeloma).&nbsp; Among women, incidence rates decreased for six of the 18 most common cancers (colon and rectum, bladder, cervix, oral cavity and pharynx, ovary, and stomach), and increased for eight others (thyroid, melanoma of the skin, kidney, pancreas, leukemia, liver, myeloma and uterus).</p>
<p>&ldquo;Similar to death rates, the overall decrease in cancer incidence rates among men was&nbsp;driven in part&nbsp;by declines in lung cancer, mainly reflecting the success of tobacco control interventions,&rdquo; said John R. Seffrin, Ph.D., chief executive officer of the American Cancer Society. &ldquo;We are particularly heartened&nbsp;to see that&nbsp;in the most recent time period, from 2005 to 2010, lung cancer incidence rates dropped among women. Nonetheless, lung cancer remains by far the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women.&rdquo;</p>
<p><b>Comorbidities and Cancer</b></p>
<p>The special feature section of the report discusses the prevalence of comorbidities among Medicare beneficiaries with lung, colorectal, breast, and prostate cancer and how these conditions influence survival due to a person&rsquo;s cancer and other illnesses. &nbsp;Forty percent of patients 66 years of age or older, with any of these four cancers, had at least one comorbidity. &nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Measures of comorbidity can contribute to understanding how multiple diseases work together to affect outcomes. For cancer patients, incorporating comorbidity measures into treatment planning may lead to better decisions about the potential risks and benefits of treatment options.</p>
<p>For this analysis, the authors linked cancer registry data from NCI with Medicare claims data that identified the presence of comorbidities in patients ages 66 or older, one year prior to their diagnosis of cancer. Cancer stage was included in this survival model because patients with late-stage cancer have higher death rates than those diagnosed with earlier stage cancer, even after accounting for comorbidity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;More and more Americans are winning the battle against cancer and are living long, healthy, and productive lives,&rdquo; said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D.&nbsp; &ldquo;However, cancer patients with underlying health conditions, such as diabetes, have special challenges. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s critical for health care providers to have the full picture of their patients&rsquo; health so they can provide the best treatment possible for the patient overall, and for their cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cancers with a high prevalence of comorbidities were lung cancer (52.9 percent) and colorectal cancer (40.7 percent), while the prevalence of comorbidities for those with breast cancer (32.2 percent) or prostate cancer (30.5 percent) was similar to that seen in non-cancer patients (31.8 percent).&nbsp; Sixteen comorbidities were identified in patients in the year prior to cancer diagnosis, including acute myocardial infarction (heart attack), AIDS, stroke, chronic kidney failure, chronic hepatitis, and others. &nbsp;The four most common comorbidities include diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease.</p>
<p>Some of the more notable associations of comorbidities and survival included:</p>
<ul>
<li>For women with breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage of the disease, 5-year survival varied by age and comorbidity level.&nbsp; For example, for women ages 66-74 with early stage disease, the probability of death for low or moderate comorbidity levels was almost double the probability of death compared to women with no comorbidity, while for women with severe comorbidity levels, the likelihood of dying was nearly triple compared to women with no comorbidity.&nbsp; Comorbidity levels were associated with a similar impact on 5-year survival among men ages 66-74 with prostate cancer diagnosed at an early stage.&nbsp; By contrast, comorbidity levels had relatively little or modest impact on the survival of women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer or men with advanced prostate cancer.</li>
<li>For colorectal cancer, comorbidity and age were associated with decreased 5-year survival among men and women with early stage disease, but not among patients with advanced disease.&nbsp;</li>
<li>For lung cancer, the influence of comorbidities on survival was relatively small, probably because prognosis is often poor, even at early stages of the disease.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Cancer rates are edging down for both new cases and for deaths, which is definitely good news,&rdquo; noted NAACCR director Betsy Kohler. &ldquo;But there are still too many cancer types that require a rededication of effort to help get those rates reversed so that we&rsquo;re showing real progress for all forms of cancer.&rdquo;</p>

<ul>
<li>This report provides a regular update of cancer incidence (new cases) and mortality (death) rates and trends in these rates in the United States. From 2001-2010, overall cancer incidence rates declined among men (0.6% per year), were stable among women, and increased among children (0.8% per year). (<a href="#que5">Question 5</a>)</li>
<li>Overall cancer death rates continued to decline, a trend that began in the early 1990s. From 2001-2010, death rates decreased by 1.8% per year among men, by 1.4% per year among women, and by 1.9% per year among children ages 0-14. (<a href="#que7">Question 7</a>)</li>
<li>Decrease in deaths from four most common cancers &ndash; lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal &ndash; are driving continued overall decrease in cancer death rates. (<a href="#que7">Question 7</a>)</li>
<li>In this year&rsquo;s special feature section, the authors highlight the prevalence of comorbidity among older persons and its impact on survival among persons diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast or prostate cancer. Age and comorbidity level were important influences on the probability of dying of other causes and overall survival. Advanced stage was an important influence on the probability of dying of cancer. (<a href="#que12">Question 12</a>)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><b>1. What is the purpose of this report and who created it?</b></p>
<p>This report provides a yearly update of cancer incidence (new cases), mortality (death) rates, and trends in these rates in the United States. The special feature section of this year&rsquo;s Report highlights the prevalence of comorbidity and its impact on survival among persons 66 years of age and older who were diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast or prostate cancer. Comorbidities are defined as coexisting medical conditions that are distinct from the principal cancer diagnosis.</p>
<p>The American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR) have collaborated since 1998 to produce the Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>2. What are the sources of the data?</b></p>
<p>Cancer mortality information in the U.S. is based on causes of death reported by physicians on death certificates and filed by each state&rsquo;s vital statistics offices. The mortality information is processed and consolidated in a national database by the CDC through the National Vital Statistics System, which covers the entire United States.</p>
<p>Information on newly diagnosed cancer cases occurring in the U.S. is based on data collected by registries in the NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and CDC's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR). NAACCR evaluates data annually from the registries of both programs and provides combined data for this analysis.</p>
<p>Long-term (1992-2010) overall incidence trends for all cancer sites combined, childhood cancers, and for the 15 most common cancers were based on SEER incidence data covering about 13 percent of the U.S. population. Data from combined SEER and NPCR population-based cancer registries were used to estimate cancer incidence rates and short-term (2001-2010) trends for five major racial and ethnic groups: white, black, Asian and Pacific Islander, American Indian/Alaska Native, and Hispanic. For the time period 2006-2010, 46 registries (covering 90.1 percent of the U.S. population) met NAACCR data quality criteria, and for the time period 2001-2010, 42 registries (covering 85.4 percent of the U.S. population) met these criteria.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>3. Which reporting periods were chosen as a main focus of the report?</b></p>
<p>The period from 2006-2010 was used for describing the U.S. burden of cancer (rates), and the period from 2001-2010 was used for describing trends in cancer incidence and death rates for five major racial and ethnic groups. The period from 1975-2010 was chosen to provide the best perspective on long-term trends in cancer death rates among all races combined, while the period from 1992-2010 was chosen to provide the best perspective on long-term incidence trends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>4. What is detailed in the special feature section of this year&rsquo;s report?</b></p>
<p>In this year&rsquo;s special feature section, the authors highlight the prevalence of comorbidity among older persons and its impact on survival among persons diagnosed with lung, colorectal, breast or prostate cancer. For cancer patients, survival and the probabilities of dying of their cancer and of other causes by comorbidity level, age, and stage were calculated. The comorbidity index score in this report used claims from SEER-Medicare cancer patients diagnosed from 1992 through 2005.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Update on Incidence and Mortality Trends for All Cancer Sites Combined and the Most Common Cancers</span></b></p>
<p id="que5">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>5. What is happening with cancer incidence trends overall?</b></p>
<p>Incidence rates represent the number of reported new cases over a period of time per 100,000 people in the general population. From 2001-2010, age-adjusted incidence rates for all cancers combined declined 0.6 percent per year among men, were stable among women, and increased by 0.8 percent per year among children 14 years and under as well as for children 19 years of age and younger (see Table 1 of the Report).</p>
<p>While declines in cancer mortality rates are always good news, changes in incidence rates may represent both good and bad news. Declines in cancer incidence rates that occur as a result of decreased modifiable risk factors or increased use of screening tests (colorectal and cervical cancer screening) that allow the detection and removal of precancerous lesions are good news. However, a drop in screening rates can also make it appear that incidence rates are lower while in fact some cancers will not be detected early and may not be discovered until they are at a more advanced stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>6. What is happening with long-term incidence trends for the most common cancers?</b></p>
<p>From 2001-2010, age-adjusted incidence rates decreased for six of the 17 most common cancers among men (prostate, lung, colon and rectum, stomach, brain and other nervous [brain], and larynx). In contrast, incidence rates increased among men for eight cancers (kidney and renal pelvis [kidney], pancreas, liver and intrahepatic bile duct [liver], non-Hodgkin lymphoma [NHL], thyroid, leukemia, melanoma of the skin [melanoma], and myeloma) during the same time period (see Table 1 of the Report).</p>
<p>Among women, incidence rates from 2001-2010 decreased for six of the 18 most common cancers (colon and rectum, urinary bladder [bladder], cervix uteri [cervix], oral cavity and pharynx [oral], ovary, and stomach), and increased for eight cancers (thyroid, melanoma, kidney, pancreas, leukemia, liver, myeloma, and corpus and uterus NOS [uterus]).</p>
<p>Note that findings are presented for the top 17 cancers among men and 18 cancers among women in order to accommodate the top 15 cancers for all races and ethnicities combined, and for each major racial and ethnic group. Cancer represents over a hundred different types of diseases, based on where it occurs in the body as well as the biological features of the tumor. The Report uses broad groupings to present cancer statistics on rates and trends; however, reports for more specific types of cancer require customized analyses. As the understanding of the biological and genetic features of cancers evolve and are reported in medical records, experts may revise how cancers are grouped for statistical reporting (see Table 3 of the Report).</p>
<p id="que7">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>7. What is happening with cancer mortality trends overall?</b></p>
<p>Overall age-adjusted cancer death rates continued to decline, a trend that began in the early 1990s. From 2001-2010, death rates decreased by 1.8 percent per year among men, by 1.4 percent per year among women, by 1.9 percent per year among children ages 0-14, and by 2.1 percent per year among children 0-19 years (see Table 2 of the Report). Age-adjusted death rates are the best indicator of progress against cancer, although other measures, such as quality of life, are also important.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>8. What is happening with death rates for the most common cancers among men and women?</b></p>
<p>During the most recent 10-year period (2001-2010), death rates among men decreased for 11 of the 17 most common cancers (lung, prostate, colon and rectum, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, esophagus, kidney, stomach, myeloma, oral cavity and pharynx, and larynx) and increased for four others (cancer of the pancreas, liver, melanoma, and soft tissue including heart) (see Table 2 of the Report).</p>
<p>During the same period, death rates among women decreased for 15 of the 18 most common cancers (lung, breast, colon and rectum, ovary, leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, brain and other central nervous system, myeloma, kidney, stomach, cervix, bladder, esophagus, oral cavity and pharynx, and gallbladder) and increased for cancers of the pancreas, liver, and uterus.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>9. If cancer death rates continue to fall, does that mean the number of people dying from cancer will also continue to fall?</b></p>
<p>Not necessarily. The data described in the report are rates (number of deaths per 100,000 persons in the U.S.) and are adjusted for age so they can be compared across groups that vary by factors such as race, time period, and regions with different age structures (i.e., some areas have higher concentrations of older people while others have more young people). The actual number of people dying from cancer (sometimes called the count) can be influenced by several factors, including the growth in the number of older people in the U.S. (cancer is primarily a disease of aging), as well as an increase in the size of the population.</p>
<p>Therefore, although the cancer death rate may go down during a particular period, the actual number of cancer deaths could go up because the number of older Americans is increasing and the overall size of the population is increasing,</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>10. What is happening with childhood cancer rates?</b></p>
<p>Cancer incidence rates increased 0.8 percent each year from 1992-2010 among children ages 14 or younger and also ages 19 or younger. However, considerable progress has been seen for many types of childhood cancers, resulting in very long-term overall declines in death rates for cancer among children. In the most recent 10-year period, cancer death rates among children ages 0 to14 declined 1.9 percent and children ages 0 to 19 declined 2.1 percent per year; for a more recent period (2006-2010), the decline was 2.4 percent per year.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Comorbidity and Survival of Cancer Patients</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>11. Why is measuring comorbidity important?</b></p>
<p>Comorbidity is the condition of having two or more diseases at the same time. Measures of comorbidity contribute to understanding how multiple diseases affect an individual&rsquo;s health status, impact medical management and treatment decisions, and predict outcomes.&nbsp; Incorporating comorbidity measures into treatment decisions may allow for more accurate assessment of risks and benefits of different forms of treatment because cancer patients and survivors with multiple comorbidities likely require coordinated care and support.&nbsp;</p>
<p id="que12">&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>12. How were cancer survival estimates determined when looking at comorbidities?</b></p>
<p>Investigators linked SEER cancer registry data with Medicare claims from the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) that reported on the presence or absence of comorbidities among patients at age 66 or older, one year prior to their cancer diagnosis. This data was then used to calculate survival estimates that were based upon comorbidity levels and cancer stage at diagnosis. Cancer stage was included in this survival model because patients with advanced stage cancer have higher mortality rates than those diagnosed with earlier stage cancer, even after accounting for comorbidity status.</p>
<p>Specifically, for every cancer patient in the study, the authors looked at three outcomes: if a patient was still alive; if they died of their diagnosed cancer; or if they died of some other cause.&nbsp; They characterized each cancer patient by their type of cancer, stage (extent of disease), age, and comorbidity level.</p>
<p>Relative survival, a complex mathematical calculation that takes into account various factors in the general population, is typically presented in cancer statistical reports. In this Report, the authors present crude survival measurements that take into account the risks of dying from non-cancer causes as well as the risks of dying of cancer, as these are more useful for clinical purposes.</p>
<p>Survival measures in this Report are presented as survival (due to any cause of death), probabilities of dying of causes due to the specific cancer, and probabilities of dying of other causes. In general, age and the presence of comorbidities in the year prior to diagnosis influence the probability of dying of other causes while stage of the disease (how advanced is the cancer) is more predictive of the probability of dying of cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>13. What cancer types showed the highest prevalence of comorbidities from 2001-2010?</b></p>
<p>Among the top four cancers occurring in over half of older patients, the prevalence of comorbidities was:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lung cancer: 52.9 percent</li>
<li>Colorectal cancer: 40.7 percent</li>
<li>Breast cancer: 32.2 percent</li>
<li>Prostate cancer: 30.5 percent</li>
</ul>
<p>One or more comorbidities were present in 31.8 percent of non-cancer patients (see Table 5).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>14. What comorbidities were identified in patients in the year prior to cancer diagnosis?</b></p>
<p>The comorbidities identified in patients in the year prior to cancer diagnosis were based on Medicare claims reports, and included (see Table 5):</p>
<ul>
<li>Acute myocardial infarction (heart attack)</li>
<li>Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)</li>
<li>Cerebrovascular disease (stroke)</li>
<li>Chronic renal failure (chronic kidney disease)</li>
<li>Cirrhosis/chronic hepatitis</li>
<li>Congestive heart failure</li>
<li>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD, lung disease)</li>
<li>Dementia</li>
<li>Diabetes or diabetes with sequelae</li>
<li>History of myocardial infarction (irreversible heart disease)</li>
<li>Liver disease</li>
<li>Paralysis</li>
<li>Rheumatologic disease (arthritis)</li>
<li>Ulcer disease</li>
<li>Vascular disease</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>15. What comorbidities were most prevalent among cancer patients?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Among the comorbidities identified, the most common types were (see Table 5):</p>
<ul>
<li>Diabetes: 16.0 percent</li>
<li>COPD: 15.5 percent</li>
<li>Congestive heart failure: 9.7 percent</li>
<li>Cerebrovascular disease: 6.0 percent</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>16. How were comorbidities ranked for severity?</b></p>
<p>Comorbidities were grouped into three levels using scores calculated from claims data and statistical models for older persons in the SEER-Medicare linked database:</p>
<ul>
<li>Low comorbidity conditions usually do not require adjusting cancer treatment. Conditions associated with low comorbidity include ulcer or rheumatologic disease (ulcer, arthritis or other rheumatic disease).</li>
<li>Moderate comorbidity conditions that may require modifying cancer treatment. Conditions include diabetes, vascular disease, paralysis, and AIDS.</li>
<li>Severe comorbidity involves severe illness that always requires adjusting cancer treatment. Conditions associated with severe comorbidity include chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), liver dysfunction, chronic renal failure, dementia and congestive heart failure. Patients in the severe group generally have multiple comorbidities.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>17. How does comorbidity influence the survival of breast cancer patients?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>For women with breast cancer diagnosed at an early stage of the disease, 5-year survival varied by age and comorbidity level. For example, for women ages 66-74 with early stage disease, the probability of death for low or moderate comorbidity levels was almost double the probability of death compared to women with no comorbidity, while for women with severe comorbidity levels, the likelihood of dying was nearly triple compared to women with no comorbidity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Comorbidity levels were associated with a similar impact on 5-year survival among men ages 66-74 with prostate cancer diagnosed at an early stage. By contrast, comorbidity levels had relatively little or modest impact on the survival of women diagnosed with advanced breast cancer or men with advanced prostate cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>18. How does comorbidity influence the survival of men with prostate cancer?&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>Men diagnosed with prostate cancer had comorbidity levels similar to those among female breast cancer patients. Between two percent to 14 percent of men diagnosed with prostate cancer at a localized stage died from their cancer, in all age and comorbidity groups. Among men diagnosed with prostate cancer at a regional stage, especially those ages 75 to 84, the probability of both cancer and non-cancer death increased with comorbidity level. Men diagnosed with prostate cancer at an advanced stage had more than a 54 percent probability of cancer death regardless of age and comorbidity level.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>19. How does comorbidity influence the survival of colorectal cancer patients?</b></p>
<p>Colorectal cancer patients had a prevalence of comorbidity of 40.7 percent compared to the cancer-free group of similar age patients who had a prevalence of 31.8 percent. The prevalence of diabetes among colorectal cancer patients was 17.2 percent which was higher than the cancer free-group who had a 13.9 percent prevalence of diabetes.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Among women and men diagnosed with colorectal cancer, approximately 7 percent to 26 percent of those diagnosed at localized stages died from their cancer in all age and comorbidity groups compared with 25 percent to 44 percent of those with regional stage disease and also compared with over 80 percent of those with advanced stage disease. Overall survival and probability of non-cancer death was strongly related to comorbidity level among men and women diagnosed with colorectal cancer at a local or regional stage.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>20. How does comorbidity influence the survival of lung cancer patients?</b></p>
<p>Lung cancer patients had the highest prevalence of comorbidities of all cancer types at 52.9 percent. Among lung cancer patients, the most prevalent comorbidity was COPD at 33.6 percent. The prevalence of congestive heart failure was also high in lung cancer patients at 12.4 percent.</p>
<p>The influence of comorbidities on the probability of both cancer and non-cancer death was smaller for lung cancer than for other cancers, due to relatively poor prognoses regardless of the stage at which lung cancer is diagnosed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>21.&nbsp; What else can we learn from examining comorbidity among cancer patients?</b></p>
<p>The prevalence of comorbidity helps us understand that a large proportion of recently diagnosed cancer patients have other conditions in addition to cancer and more research is needed to understand how best to treat these patients. Comorbidities also help to better quantify risk. Although cancer registries do not routinely collect data on comorbidities, registry data may be supplemented with comorbidity data from several other sources.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to Read This Report&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>22. How are cancer incidence and death rates presented?</b></p>
<p>Cancer incidence rates and death rates are typically measured as the number of cases or deaths per 100,000 people per year and are age-adjusted to the 2000 U.S. standard population. When a cancer affects only one sex, for example, prostate cancer, then the number is per 100,000 persons of that sex. The numbers are age-adjusted, which allows for comparison of rates from different populations with varying age composition over time and in different regions.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>23. What is annual percent change or APC?</b></p>
<p>The annual percent change (APC) is the average rate of change in a cancer rate per year in a given time frame (i.e., how fast or slowly a cancer rate has increased or decreased each year over a period of years). The APC was calculated for both incidence and death rates. The number is given as a percent, such as: an approximate 1 percent per year decrease. The APC is calculated using joinpoint regression (see below for an explanation of joinpoints).</p>
<p>A negative APC describes a decreasing trend, and a positive APC describes an increasing trend. In this report, all trends mentioned in the text are statistically significant unless noted otherwise. For non-statistically significant trends, terms such as &ldquo;stable,&rdquo; &ldquo;non-significant increase,&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-significant decrease&rdquo; were used.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>24. What is average annual percent change or AAPC?</b></p>
<p>The report also uses the average annual percent change (AAPC) as an addendum to the underlying joinpoint (see below for an explanation of joinpoints) regression estimates of annual percent change (APC). This summary measure is an estimate of trends for a fixed interval of time and allows comparison of trends among many racial and ethnic groups and types of cancer.</p>
<p>The AAPC quantifies the average trend over a fixed period of multiple years.</p>
<p>Similar to the APC, a negative AAPC describes a decreasing trend, and a positive AAPC describes an increasing trend. In this report, all trends are statistically significant unless noted otherwise. For non-statistically significant trends, terms such as &ldquo;stable,&rdquo; &ldquo;non-significant increase,&rdquo; and &ldquo;non-significant decrease&rdquo; were used.</p>
<p>Long-term trends can obscure shorter term changes. Differences in the 5-year and 10-year AAPCs typically identify types of cancer where the 10-year average trend may mask important recent changes, which occur more often for incidence trends than for death trends. For example, in this report, the trend for lung cancer deaths and for childhood cancer deaths show a more rapid decline when looking at the 5-year AAPC than the 10-year AAPC.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>25. What is joinpoint regression analysis, and how does it account for the different time periods used for trends analysis in this report?</b></p>
<p>Joinpoint regression analysis is a statistical method that describes changing trends over successive segments of time and the amount of increase or decrease within each segment. This analysis involves fitting a series of joined straight lines to the age-adjusted rates and choosing the best-fitting point or points, called joinpoints, where the rate of increase or decrease changes significantly. Thus, each joinpoint denotes a statistically significant change in trend. The resulting line segment between joinpoints can be described by an annual percent change (APC) that is based on the slope of the line segment. Joinpoint analyses were performed for incidence and mortality trends.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>26. Why were rates adjusted for delays in reporting incidence data to SEER?</b></p>
<p>The report presents analyses of long-term trends in cancer incidence rates with and without adjustment for reporting delays and more complete information. Adjusting for these delays and accumulating more complete and accurate information provides the basis for a potentially more definitive assessment of incidence rates and trends, particularly in the most recent years for which data are available. Cancer registries routinely take two to three years to compile their current cancer statistics. An additional one to two years may be required to have more complete incidence data on certain cancers, such as melanomas and leukemias when they are diagnosed in outpatient settings. Cancer registries continue to update incidence rates to include these cases. Consequently, the data initially reported for certain cancer incidence rates may be an underestimate.</p>
<p>Long-term reporting patterns in NCI&rsquo;s SEER registries have been analyzed, and it is now possible to adjust incidence rates for all cancers combined and for site-specific cancers with a correction for expected reporting delays and more complete information. However, SEER registries do not cover the entire population, thus combined data from SEER and CDC&rsquo;s National Program of Cancer Registries (which is not delay adjusted) is important for assessing the incidence of cancer in the U.S. &nbsp;Methodologic research is in progress to adjust for reporting delays of pooled data from SEER and the National Program of Cancer Registries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Other Information&nbsp;</span></b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>27.&nbsp; Why is this the second Annual Report published in 2013?</b></p>
<p>The first Annual Report published in 2013 was on January 7 in <i>JNCI</i>. This second Annual Report is being published online on December 16, 2013, in <i>Cancer</i>.&nbsp; Publication dates are determined by journal editors and sometimes publication is delayed for a variety of reasons, thus leading to two Annual Reports being published in the same calendar year, albeit about 12 months apart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>28. What other data issues need to be considered?</b></p>
<p>This report uses population estimates that incorporated both the 2000 and the 2010 Census results from the U.S. Census Bureau to calculate incidence and death rates. With incorporation of the 2010 census in this report, the populations for the intercensal years are more accurate than in prior reports where these data were estimated based only on the 2000 census.&nbsp;The official 2010 census revealed that Americans are increasingly self-identifying in ways that deviate from traditional racial and ethnic categories.&nbsp;Reassignment methods used for Hispanics who self-identified as &ldquo;some other race&rdquo;&nbsp;resulted in&nbsp;19 percent more AI/AN, 9 percent more API, along with 31 percent more individuals of multiple races.&nbsp;The cancer rates for the AI/AN and API populations are lower relative to the white and black populations reported in previous years, which is likely a function of the reassignment methods rather than representing a genuine trend.</p>

The genetic alterations identified in this malignancy could be useful in developing targeted diagnostic tools and treatments for children with the disease. The study, by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and their colleagues, appeared in the Jan. 23, 2014, issue of the journal Cancer Discovery<i>.</i></p><p>Rhabdomyosarcoma is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma in children and affects muscles in any part of the body. Among patients diagnosed with non-metastasized disease, about 80 percent survive at least five years, although they may experience substantial treatment-related toxic effects. However, for those with metastatic disease, the five-year survival rate is about 30 percent even with aggressive treatment.&#160;</p><p>NCI&#8217;s effort to characterize the genetic events that contribute to rhabdomyosarcoma was led by Javed Khan, M.D., head of the Oncogenomics Section, Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, and Jack Shern, M.D., a clinical fellow.</p><p>&#8220;These studies are very difficult to do because tissue acquisition and validation is so complex,&#8221; said Khan. &#8220;It must be noted therefore that this work would not have been possible without our brave pediatric patients and their families. In the face of their life-threatening disease, they offered their tumors for study knowing that they would not personally benefit from this work but in the hope that investigators might learn lessons that would help children diagnosed with rhabdomyosarcoma in the future.&#8221;</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5460400" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="2090" sys_dependentid="695150">

Nevertheless, they did find relatively frequent somatic mutations in several genes, including NRAS, KRAS, HRAS, FGFR4, PIK3CA, CTNNB<i>,</i> all of which had previously been found to be mutated in rhabdomyosarcoma, as well as the genes FBXW7 and BCOR<i>,</i> which had not been previously associated with this disease.</p><p>Moreover, they identified mutations in additional genes in the RAS/PIK3CA signaling pathway.

<p>Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have identified new potential therapeutic targets for a major form of bladder cancer, including important genes and pathways that are disrupted in the disease. They also discovered that, at the molecular level, some subtypes of bladder cancer &ndash; also known as urothelial carcinoma &ndash; resemble subtypes of breast, head and neck and lung cancers, suggesting similar routes of development.</p>
<p>The researchers&rsquo; findings provide important insights into the mechanisms underlying bladder cancer, which is estimated to cause more than 15,000 deaths in the United States in 2014. TCGA is a collaboration jointly supported and managed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both parts of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TCGA Research Network scientists continue to unravel the genomic intricacies of many common and often intractable cancers, and these findings are defining new research directions and accelerating the development of new cancer therapies,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis Collins, M.D., Ph.D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this study, published online Jan. 29, 2014, in <i>Nature</i>, investigators examined bladder cancer that invades the muscle of the bladder, the deadliest form of the disease. The current standard treatments for muscle-invasive bladder cancer include surgery and radiation combined with chemotherapy. There are no recognized second-line therapies &ndash; second choices for treatments when the initial therapy does not work &ndash; and no approved targeted agents for this type of bladder cancer. Approximately 72,000 new cases of bladder cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2014. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project has dramatically improved our understanding of the molecular basis of bladder cancers and their relationship to other cancer types,&rdquo; said lead author John Weinstein, M.D., Ph.D., professor and chair of the Department of Bioinformatics and Computational Biology at The University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. &ldquo;In the long run, the potential molecular targets identified may help us to personalize therapy based on the characteristics of each patient&rsquo;s tumor.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The real excitement about this project is that we now have a menu of treatment and research directions to pursue,&rdquo; said Seth Lerner, M.D., professor and chair in urologic oncology at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, and one of the senior authors of the paper. &ldquo;The field is poised to use this information to make new advances toward therapies for a very difficult to <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>treat form of bladder cancer.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>
<p>The research team analyzed DNA, RNA and protein data generated from the study of 131 muscle-invasive bladder cancers from patients who had not yet been treated with chemotherapy, radiation or any type of therapy.&nbsp; The scientists found recurrent mutations in 32 genes, including nine that were not previously known to be significantly mutated. They discovered mutations in the TP53 gene in nearly half of the tumor samples, and mutations and other aberrations in the RTK/RAS pathway (which is commonly affected in cancers) in 44 percent of tumors. TP53 makes the p53 tumor suppressor protein, which helps regulate cell division. RTK/RAS is involved in regulating cell growth and development.</p>
<p>The investigators also showed that genes that regulate chromatin &ndash; a combination of DNA and protein within a cell&rsquo;s nucleus that determines how genes are expressed &ndash; were more frequently mutated in bladder cancer than in any other common cancer studied to date. These findings suggest the possibility of developing therapies to target alterations in chromatin remodeling.</p>
<p>Overall, the researchers identified potential drug targets in 69 percent of the tumors evaluated. They found frequent mutations in the ERBB2, or HER2, gene. The researchers also identified recurring mutations as well as fusions involving other genes such as FGFR3 and in the PI3-kinase/AKT/mTOR pathway, which help control cell division and growth and for which targeted drugs already exist.</p>
<p>Because the HER2 gene and its encoded protein, HER2 &ndash; which affects cell growth and development &ndash; are implicated in a significant portion of breast cancers, scientists would like to find out if new agents under development against breast cancer can also be effective in treating subsets of bladder cancer patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve organized our medical care around the affected organ system,&rdquo; Dr. Lerner said. &ldquo;We have thought of each of these cancers as having its own characteristics unique to the affected organ. Increasingly, we are finding that cancers cross those lines at the molecular level, where some individual cancers affecting different organs look very similar. As targeted drug agents go through preclinical and clinical development, we hope that rather than treating 10 percent of breast cancers or 5 percent of bladder cancers, it eventually will make sense to treat multiple cancer types where the target is expressed.&rdquo; The same theme runs through TCGA&rsquo;s Pan-Cancer project, which is aimed at identifying genomic similarities across cancer types, with the goal of gaining a more global understanding of cancer behavior and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is increasingly evident that there are genomic commonalities among cancers that we can take advantage of in the future,&rdquo; said NHGRI Director Eric D. Green, M.D., Ph.D. &ldquo;TCGA is providing us with a repertoire of possibilities for developing new cancer therapeutics.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The scientists also uncovered a potential viral connection to bladder cancer. It is known that animal papilloma viruses can cause bladder cancer. In a small number of cases, DNA from viruses &ndash; notably, from HPV16, a form of the virus responsible for cervical cancer &ndash; was found in bladder tumors. This suggests that viral infection can contribute to bladder cancer development.</p>
<p>Tobacco is a major risk factor for bladder cancer; more than 70 percent of the cases analyzed in this study occurred in former or current smokers. However, the analysis did not identify major molecular differences between the tumors that developed in patients with or without a history of smoking.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The definitive molecular portrait of bladder cancer by the TCGA Network has uncovered a promising array of potential therapeutic targets that provides a blueprint for investigations into the activity of existing and novel therapeutic agents in this cancer,&rdquo; said Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., director, NCI Center for Cancer Genomics.</p>

A trial in which patients are randomly assigned to various treatment options is the gold-standard method for determining which treatment option is best.&#160;</p><p>Researchers hope that in addition to the knowledge gained from the trial about assigning therapy based on results of genetic sequencing of tumors, this trial could identify patient sub-groups that are likely to benefit from certain treatments and result in new treatments being developed quickly for some cancers. &#160;This could ultimately lead to smaller, more definitive clinical trials, which would be helpful to clinicians and patients in terms of cost and time.</p><p>&#8220;Patients will have their tumors genetically screened and if a pre-defined mutation is found, they will receive treatment with targeted agents,&#8221; said Shivaani Kummar, M.D., head of NCI&#8217;s Developmental Therapeutics Clinic and the principal investigator of the trial.&#160; &#8220;What we don&#8217;t know, however, is whether using this approach to assign targeted treatments is really effective at providing clinical benefit to patients, as most tumors have multiple mutations and it&#8217;s not always clear which mutation to target and which agent is most likely to provide maximal benefit. This study hopes to address some of these questions in the context of a prospective, randomized trial.&#8221;</p><p>Very few types of tumors have just one mutated gene that triggers cancer progression.&#160; Once a gene is mutated, it can lead to the activation of multiple pathways, resulting in disease progression and potentially requiring multiple interventions.&#160; Therefore, NCI&#8217;s M-PACT trial is designed to determine whether people with specific mutations that have been demonstrated in laboratory systems to affect drug effectiveness will benefit from a specifically chosen targeted intervention and if these interventions lead to better outcomes.</p><p>For NCI&#8217;s M-PACT study, after screening hundreds of people, 180 patients with advanced refractory solid tumors (those resistant to standard therapy) will be enrolled based on their genetic profile.&#160; During the screening process, samples of the tumors will be genetically sequenced to look for a total of 391 different mutations in 20 genes that are known to affect the utility of targeted therapies.&#160; If mutations of interest are detected, using a molecular sequencing protocol for tumor biopsy samples evaluated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, those patients will be enrolled in the trial and randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms to receive one of the four treatment regimens that are part of this study. &#160;</p><p>To ensure that patients receive the best treatment already known to provide benefit, patients with specific tumor types should have received certain therapies prior to being enrolled in NCI&#8217;s&#160;M-PACT. For instance:</p><ul><li>Patients with melanoma whose tumors have mutations in the V600E region of the BRAF gene should have received and progressed on a specific BRAF inhibitor therapy to be eligible for NCI&#8217;s M-PACT trial.</li><li>Patients with lung cancer should have had their tumors tested for the presence of EGFR and ALK gene mutations, and, if mutations were detected, they should have received and progressed on therapies targeting EGFR or ALK, respectively.</li></ul><p>Patients with all types of solid tumors will be considered for trial eligibility.&#160;For the randomization, patients will be assigned to Arm A (they will receive a treatment regimen prospectively identified to target their specific mutation or relevant pathway) or Arm B (they will receive a treatment regimen not prospectively identified to target their specific mutation or relevant pathway).&#160; Patients in Arm B will have the option to cross over to Arm A to receive therapy identified to target their specific mutation or relevant pathway if their disease progresses on their initial study treatment.&#160; As of January 2014, the study is open for patient accrual.&#160;&#160; Clinicians hope that they can rapidly enroll patients and report results of their findings by 2017.</p><p>&#8220;We believe that this study will aid patients in the trial that will be conducted initially at the NCI, and subsequently expanded to clinical trials sites participating in the NCI-supported Early Therapeutics Clinical Trials Network,&#8221; said James Doroshow, M.D., NCI deputy director for clinical and translational research. &#8220;We also believe that M-PACT can be a model for trials nationwide, particularly those that employ genetically-driven treatment selection approaches in their design.&#8221;</p><p>For more information on NCI&#8217;s M-PACT trial, please go to: <a href="http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01827384?term=MPACT&amp;rank=3">http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01827384?term=MPACT&amp;rank=3</a>.</p></div>]]></row>

HPV infection is known to cause virtually all cervical cancers, along with some genital and anal cancers. It has recently been established as a cause of the majority of oropharyngeal cancers, a malignancy of the upper part of the throat. Aim&#233;e R. Kreimer, Ph.D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, and her collaborators at the Moffitt Cancer Center, Tampa, also determined that acquisition of oral HPV appeared more common among smokers and unmarried men.

The natural history of HPV infection in the oral region among healthy people has not been described. To determine the pattern of acquisition and persistence, the researchers evaluated the HPV infection status in oral gargle samples collected from more than 1,600 men in Brazil, Mexico, and the United States as part of the HPV Infection in Men (HIM) study. Over a 12-month period, 4.4 percent of participants acquired an oral HPV infection (which includes all types of HPV), 1.7 percent were infected with a cancer-causing HPV type, and 0.6 percent with HPV16, the HPV type responsible for the majority of HPV-related oropharyngeal cancers. These observed rates are considerably lower than cervical and other genital tract HPV infections among healthy individuals. The age pattern was also different -- oral HPV infections were acquired across the age range in the study, while cervical HPV infections typically peak shortly after sexual initiation. For men with any new infection, the estimated median time to clearance was 6 months, similar to rates observed at other anatomic sites where HPV causes cancer. &#160;</p></div>]]></row>

<p>Women who take aspirin daily may reduce their risk of ovarian cancer by 20 percent, according to a study by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. However, further research is needed before clinical recommendations can be made. The study was published Feb. 6, 2014, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>It is estimated that over 20,000 women in the United States will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2014, and more than 14,000 will die from the disease. Early stage ovarian cancer may be successfully treated. However, symptoms associated with this disease can mimic more common conditions, such as digestive and bladder disorders, so for this reason and others, it is often not diagnosed until it has reached advanced stages. Late stage ovarian cancer leaves women with limited treatment options and poor prognoses, making preventive strategies potentially important for controlling this disease.</p>
<p>Chronic or persistent inflammation has been shown to increase the risk of cancer and other diseases. Previous studies have suggested that the anti-inflammatory properties of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), may reduce cancer risk overall. However, studies examining whether use of these agents may influence ovarian cancer risk have been largely inconclusive. This is the largest study to date to assess the relationship between these drugs and ovarian cancer risk.</p>
<p>Britton Trabert, Ph.D., and Nicolas Wentzensen, M.D., Ph.D., of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and their colleagues, analyzed data pooled from 12 large epidemiological studies to investigate whether women who used aspirin, non-aspirin NSAIDs, or acetaminophen have a lower risk of ovarian cancer. These 12 studies (nine from the United States) were part of the Ovarian Cancer Association Consortium. The scientists evaluated the benefit of these drugs in nearly 8,000 women with ovarian cancer and close to 12,000 women who did not have the disease.</p>
<p>Among study participants who reported whether or not they used aspirin regularly: 18 percent used aspirin, 24 percent used non-aspirin NSAIDs, and 16 percent used acetaminophen. The researchers determined that participants who reported daily aspirin use had a 20 percent lower risk of ovarian cancer than those who used aspirin less than once per week. For non-aspirin NSAIDs, which include a wide variety of drugs, the picture was less clear: the scientists observed a 10 percent lower ovarian cancer risk among women who used NSAIDs at least once per week compared with those who used NSAIDs less frequently. However, this finding did not fall in a range that was significant statistically. In contrast to the findings for aspirin and NSAIDs, use of acetaminophen, which is not an anti-inflammatory agent, was not associated with reduced ovarian cancer risk.</p>
<p>This study adds to a growing list of malignancies, such as colorectal and other cancers, that appear to be potentially preventable by aspirin usage. &ldquo;Our study suggests that aspirin regimens, proven to protect against heart attack, may reduce the risk of ovarian cancer as well. However intriguing our results are, they should not influence current clinical practice. Additional studies are needed to explore the delicate balance of risk-benefit for this potential chemopreventive agent, as well as studies to identify the mechanism by which aspirin may reduce ovarian cancer risk,&rdquo; said Trabert.</p>
<p>Adverse side effects of daily aspirin use include upper gastrointestinal bleeding and hemorrhagic stroke. Therefore, a daily aspirin regimen should only be undertaken with a doctor&rsquo;s approval, caution the scientists.</p>

Male breast cancer is rare, with only about 2,000 new cases expected to be diagnosed in 2014 in the United States. Since men are diagnosed with breast cancer at less than one percent the rate of women, studies on risk factors associated with this cancer in men have been limited in size and scope. Scientists at NCI addressed this issue by pooling risk factor data from over 21 studies on male breast cancer. The results of their work appeared Feb. 19, 2014, in the Journal of National Cancer Institute.&#160;</p><p>The scientists, led by Louise Brinton, Ph.D., and Michael B. Cook, Ph.D., NCI, observed a small but statistically significantly elevated risk for breast cancer in men with a high body mass index (BMI). Men with the highest BMI had a 35 percent greater risk of breast cancer compared to men with the lowest BMI. The elevated risk observed with men who have a high BMI (who often have excess breast tissue and elevated estrogen levels) appears similar to the pattern for breast cancer risk in postmenopausal women. It was also determined that gynecomastia, independent from both Klinefelter syndrome and obesity, was associated with a 10-fold increased risk of breast cancer in men. As a next step, Brinton plans to follow up these findings with a deeper analysis of the effects of naturally occurring hormones on the risk of breast cancer in men by testing hormone levels in biological samples available from some of the studies involved with the project.</p></div>]]></row>

  	</div><p>While the cure rate for this disease is high, there is a risk of developing secondary malignancies, such as breast cancer, lung cancer and stomach cancer. Past studies have linked Hodgkin lymphoma radiation and chemotherapy treatments with stomach cancer risk, but those studies have been limited in scope. To better understand the relationship between Hodgkin lymphoma treatments and subsequent stomach cancer risk, Lindsay M. Morton, Ph.D., NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and her colleagues analyzed data from the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, the United States and Canada. Their analyses included nearly 20,000 survivors of the disease who were diagnosed between 1953 and 2003.</p><p>Of 17,477 Hodgkin lymphoma cases examined, the researchers identified 89 survivors who later developed stomach cancer. From patient medical records, they obtained detailed information on treatments, which they used to estimate radiation doses to the stomach and to calculate the doses and types of chemotherapy that were used to treat the survivors&#8217; Hodgkin lymphoma. By comparing the treatments received by the survivors who developed stomach cancer with the treatments received by survivors who did not develop stomach cancer, the investigators were able to determine the risks of developing stomach cancer from the treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.</p><p>Their analysis showed that the risk of stomach cancer increased with increasing doses of radiation to the stomach. Patients who received the highest radiation doses had a risk of stomach cancer nearly threefold greater than patients who received the lowest doses. Further, the risks associated with radiation were even higher for survivors who also received the alkylating agent procarbazine, a type of chemotherapy known to cause damage to DNA. Stomach cancer risks were highly dependent on the doses of both radiation and procarbazine. This study is the first to provide clear evidence of a strong interaction between chemotherapy and radiotherapy on risk of subsequent stomach cancer.</p><p>The study also suggested that stomach cancer risk was increased for patients who received a similar alkylating agent, dacarbazine, which is commonly used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma today. However, more research on this outcome is needed because few patients in this study received dacarbazine. No other alkylating agent evaluated in this study was associated with an increased risk of stomach cancer.&#160;</p><p>&#8220;Our study adds strong support to the growing concern that stomach cancer is a rare but important adverse late effect of treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma,&#8221; said Morton. &#8220;Because Hodgkin lymphoma patients commonly receive treatment in their 20s and 30s, many of the stomach cancers arise before age 50, nearly 20 years earlier than is typical for newly diagnosed patients who have never had cancer. Clinicians who follow these survivors should be alert to patient complaints related to the gastrointestinal tract.&#8221;</p><p>This work was supported by the Intramural Research Program of NCI as well as through NCI-issued contracts.</p><p align="center"># # #</p><p><b>Reference:</b> <a id="OLE_LINK1" name="OLE_LINK1"><b>&#160;</b></a>Morton LM, Dores GM, et al.

<p><i>At the 2013 annual meeting of the American Urological Association in San Diego, the company Invivo (a subsidiary of Philips Medical Systems) unveiled a product called UroNav. Resembling a stylized computer workstation on wheels, UroNav electronically fuses together pictures from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ultrasound to create a detailed, three-dimensional view of the prostate, which physicians can then use to guide precision biopsies. Introduction of this commercial product was the result of nearly a decade&rsquo;s research and development, principally conducted at the National Cancer Institute, whose investigators have no financial stake in UroNav. Three members of the team&mdash;diagnostic radiologist Peter Choyke, M.D.; interventional radiologist Brad Wood, M.D.; and surgeon Peter Pinto, M.D.&mdash;recently sat down, along with medical oncologist William Dahut, M.D., clinical director of NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research, to discuss the challenges of prostate cancer screening, diagnosis, and treatment; benefits of image-guided biopsies; and the future of prostate cancer care.</i></p>

<p><b><i>How good is prostate cancer screening today?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Dahut</b>: The <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=1498&amp;sys_revision=174&amp;sys_variantid=990&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" sys_dependentvariantid="990" sys_dependentid="1498" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="6214381">digital rectal exam</a> is useful only in very large, advanced cancers, so it&rsquo;s a very poor screening test.</p>
<p><b>Pinto</b>: When a doctor examines the prostate by placing a finger in the rectum, only the posterior half of the prostate can be assessed. Tumors in other areas of the prostate can never be felt.</p>
<p><b>Dahut</b>: <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=690&amp;sys_revision=63&amp;sys_contentid=15458&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" sys_dependentvariantid="690" sys_dependentid="15458" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="6214368">PSA</a> [prostate-specific antigen] is not a particularly great screening test, either. The higher the value, the more likely one would find cancer upon biopsy. But there&rsquo;s no actual safe PSA value, as prostate cancer can be detected even in patients with very low PSA values. In addition, even at very high PSA levels, not all patients have cancer.&nbsp; In the values we call above normal&mdash;which is a sort of artificial term, since there&rsquo;s really no normal&mdash;if one does random biopsies, one detects cancer only about a third of the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Why is random biopsy difficult?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Choyke</b>: Random biopsies mainly sample the back part of the prostate gland near the rectum and thus miss many tumors.&nbsp; At the same time, random biopsies diagnose many low-grade, inconsequential tumors that are then overtreated. Many of the more virulent prostate cancers, which should be treated, are found in the anterior part of the gland. The major reason not to biopsy there on a routine basis is the risk of going through the urethra, the tube through which urine leaves the body. Because the biopsies are done blindly, you&rsquo;re not sure exactly where the needle is with respect to the urethra. There&rsquo;s a lot of hesitation to put the needle in that deeply.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Once you find prostate cancer, should all men consider some form of treatment?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Dahut</b>: Many men will have prostate cancer but will not have a lethal form of the disease and can live a normal life without prostate cancer treatment. However, what often happens clinically is that a screening PSA value is &ldquo;abnormal.&rdquo; This leads to a biopsy and often to the detection of prostate cancer.&nbsp; The power and fear of the word &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; drives men to opt for treatment. In certain cases, that&rsquo;s probably the right thing to do. But in other cases, the men would have easily lived the rest of their lives without the need for any treatment. We have some pathological characteristics that are useful to predict which cancers are more likely to be lethal; the best known is what we call the Gleason score. Unfortunately, we all know of patients whose Gleason score appeared to predict a benign course but whose outcome was not favorable. Potentially this may occur because the area biopsied was not a lethal tumor. In this country, we are often reluctant to recommend &ldquo;active surveillance&rdquo; because of concerns that our biopsies may not find the most aggressive cancer in the prostate. This can lead to undertreatment. At the same time, we&rsquo;re well aware that there&rsquo;s significant overtreatment of men with prostate cancer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Is the answer just to biopsy more areas of the prostate?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Choyke</b>: It&rsquo;s true that as you increase the number of biopsies from six to 12 to 18, you increase the rate of prostate cancer detection, but you don&rsquo;t necessarily increase the rate of detection of significant cancers. You tend to increase the number of insignificant cancers. So, in some respects, increasing the number of biopsies doesn&rsquo;t necessarily improve the outcome for the patient.</p>

<p><b><i>What was the genesis of UroNav?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Pinto</b>: For most cancers&mdash;breast cancer and kidney cancer, for example&mdash;you first image the patient, see the tumor, and then place a needle directly into the tumor in order to diagnose the cancer. Doctors sometimes use prostate ultrasound to perform a biopsy, but that fails to find cancers inside the prostate. It does not have specificity or sensitivity; it lacks the imaging resolution to see tumors. Ultrasound alone does not allow urologists to biopsy the tumor specifically. Another imaging test patients think of is the CT scan. These scans also do not give enough detail and do not show the tissue characteristics of a prostate tumor. MRI can see tissue details very well, locating tumors even within soft tissue organs, and it works extremely well for the prostate. But the ability for MRI to consistently find cancer inside the prostate had not been established with enough confidence to change medical practice. With the help of our NIH prostate cancer patients who came to me for surgical treatment, we accomplished that task. The pathologic examination of each prostate from the men who had surgery here allowed us to confirm the MRI&rsquo;s ability to detect their tumors.&nbsp; The MRI also allowed me to tailor my operation to their specific tumor and improve how we spare the nerves for erections and muscles for urinary control. Dr. Choyke&rsquo;s team was able to fine-tune the MRI hardware and software, to provide me detailed imaging of the prostate and its adjacent structures, like the neurovascular bundle, rectum, and urethral sphincter, along with various abnormalities in the prostate. It wasn&rsquo;t clear, though, if all those abnormalities were cancers.</p>
<p><b>Choyke</b>:&nbsp; The MRI allows us to define where the tumors are. It doesn&rsquo;t actually diagnose the cancers, but it will show you suspicious areas that carry a risk for cancer. It&rsquo;s possible to then go in under MRI guidance and stick needles into those lesions, but it&rsquo;s extremely cumbersome within an MRI scanner to do this. An MRI is an enclosed chamber, and sticking needles into a patient in this enclosed chamber is very technically difficult, time consuming, and very expensive, because MRI time is very expensive. But the idea of targeted biopsies was good. There have been gradual improvements in the quality of the MRI. There have been improvements in the ability to transport high-density information around a hospital, or a medical system, electronically. And then there are developments in fusion algorithms that superimpose one kind of image on another kind of image very accurately. Those are the technologies that are in play here. They have come together relatively recently.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>What difference does UroNav make?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Choyke</b>: The essential innovation here is taking the MRI data, fusing it using software, to ultrasound data, thus enabling the urologist to perform the biopsy under what appears to be real-time MRI. The idea was to transfer high-quality MRI data to the ultrasound suite&mdash;which could be a urologist&rsquo;s office or a procedure room somewhere else in the hospital&mdash;and fuse the MRI to the ultrasound, enabling the biopsy to be performed under the ultrasound technique, which takes 10 to 15 minutes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>From a patient&rsquo;s perspective, what is the process like?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Choyke</b>: Let&rsquo;s take a patient who has had several biopsies already, but his PSA has progressed from four to six to eight to 10. That&rsquo;s a pretty typical patient for us.</p>
<p><b>Dahut</b>: This often occurs in men in their 50s or 60s, but can occur in men in their 40s or even younger.</p>
<p><b>Choyke</b>: There&rsquo;s no prep for the MRI. We do get some blood work, to make sure that it&rsquo;s safe to inject contrast media. They fill out a brief survey. Then we place an endo-rectal coil probe in the rectum of the patient while he&rsquo;s on the MRI table and put another coil over the surface of the lower abdomen. Then the patient goes into the scanner, whereupon we do about an hour&rsquo;s worth of scanning. After that, the coil is removed and the patient can go home. There are several outcomes.</p>
<p><b>Dahut</b>: When the images are done on the MRI, they&rsquo;re looked at in terms of low, intermediate, or high likelihood of cancer.</p>
<p><b>Choyke</b>: If the patient does not have any suspicious lesions, notwithstanding the rising PSA, we&rsquo;ll turn the patient back to his regular care. If there&rsquo;s a focal lesion that&rsquo;s of concern, we generate a PowerPoint of the lesions and immediately e-mail Dr. Pinto and his team that this is a suspicious lesion. The patient returns. The UroNav procedure is done while the patient is completely awake. There&rsquo;s no sedation unless there&rsquo;s an unusual case. Dr. Pinto or Dr. Wood will administer local anesthesia into the prostatic area to reduce the pain associated with the procedure. A 3D ultrasound is performed. That&rsquo;s simply putting the ultrasound probe in the rectum, slowly pulling it back, and acquiring images all the way through. Those images go to the UroNav workstation, where the MRI has already been transmitted. The MRI data have been segmented so only the prostate is showing. The lesion has been demarcated on the screen by our team. The 3D ultrasound image is also segmented, which means just outlining where the prostate margins are, and that is done semi-automatically. The machine itself takes those segmentations and fuses them together, and in so doing, brings the site of the lesion onto the ultrasound screen. Everything that was done on the MRI is now transferred over to the ultrasound image. At that point, every time you move the ultrasound probe in any direction, you move a virtual MRI image in the exact same way. The procedure can be done as if you are looking at the MRI, whereas the information is really coming from the ultrasound. The lesion is lined up&mdash;there&rsquo;s a biopsy guide that is built into the ultrasound device that projects where a needle will go. That can be lined up with the target that&rsquo;s been identified on the MRI. Several biopsies are obtained from those lesions.</p>

<p><b><i>Does this biopsy method have any implications for prostate cancer treatment?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Pinto</b>: Prostate cancer has been treated for over a century by removing the whole prostate. One could argue that a skilled surgeon can spare the nerves that cause erections, can spare the urethra that keeps a man dry and prevents leakage of urine, and remove all the cancer safely. But that&rsquo;s a very difficult operation to perform. At many institutions, even with robotic surgery technology, men still suffer from incontinence and erectile dysfunction. It always struck me that, in an era of PSA-diagnosed, early-stage cancers, why haven&rsquo;t we changed how we manage prostate cancer? Why do we still remove the whole prostate, why do we still radiate the whole prostate, if the tumors found at a lower stage put most men at risk for the side effects of treating the whole prostate? The reason was because we could never see the tumor in the prostate, until now. Based on this advanced imaging, we developed a device to specifically biopsy a visualized prostate tumor.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s the UroNav platform. Patients have since come to me and asked, &ldquo;If you can see the prostate tumor, if you can place a biopsy needle into it and confirm it is a cancer, why take out or radiate the whole prostate and risk incontinence and impotence? Why not just go in and destroy the tumor?&rdquo; That was in 2011, when we started a new prostate cancer treatment protocol based on our imaging research, a Phase I feasibility trial to place a laser fiber into the prostate cancer and destroy the entire tumor. This allows us to target only the cancer inside the prostate for destruction.&nbsp; This image-guided focal therapy for prostate cancer can avoid the side effects of whole gland therapy, erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence.&nbsp; Although this tumor-specific treatment has been used in the past for kidney and breast cancer, this concept of focal therapy for prostate cancer is very new. It&rsquo;s been shown to be very safe and feasible here at NIH.&nbsp; As a result, we are expanding this to many more patients here, opening up a Phase II trial to confirm its cancer effectiveness.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Is this just a stopgap, while we&rsquo;re waiting for a genetic or a blood test?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Dahut</b>: Unfortunately I don&rsquo;t see a perfect test likely to be available any time soon. I think we are going to need imaging, pathology, as well as knowledge related to inherited genes and the genomics of the tumor. I think a blood test, to say, &ldquo;Is my cancer going to be the one that&rsquo;s going to kill me or not?&rdquo; is not realistic.&nbsp; Any future blood or genomic tests will need to be put in the context of all other available information such as pathology and imaging. In general, it may be easier to determine the very high risk tumors and those with the most benign characteristics, both pathologically and based on imaging criteria.&nbsp; A real challenge will be to better differentiate the intermediate-grade tumors in order to determine those which may need more aggressive treatment <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>from those in which we can potentially defer therapy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>What exactly do we mean when we talk about interventional radiology, and what is the state of the art in that field?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Wood</b>: Interventional radiology is minimally invasive, image-guided therapy, often using needles, catheters, or minimally invasive equipment, guided with imaging or video-game like software, that can integrate and fuse CT, MRI, ultrasound, X-ray, or 3D X-ray. Interventional oncology applies these tools in a multidisciplinary team to better diagnose and treat cancer. We watch as we do minimally invasive procedures, with continuous feedback on the effects of what we&rsquo;re doing while we&rsquo;re doing it, so we can modify that process and do it a little better. Information is power. Why not use that information when we need it most, while the patient is on our table? Much of what we study and help develop is focal or regional therapy, where we deliver chemotherapy to the liver, for example, through a catheter. We use the blood vessels as a roadmap to get to the liver. We also put needles into tumors to cook them with radio-wave frequency energy (or microwaves, lasers, cryoablation to freeze, or focused ultrasound, which is completely non-invasive). The non-invasive ultrasound waves can kill tissue, deliver drugs or increase the sensitivity to other treatments like radiation. The National Institutes of Health provides fertile ground for first-in-human, multidisciplinary teams to develop translational tools based on team science. The UroNav was over a decade of NIH teamwork, from concept to system to pre-clinical to patient to commercialization, and now changing the standard of care in certain settings. NIH team science!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Where might the future of prostate screening and detection lie?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Pinto</b>: PSA alone has not performed as well as we all would have liked. Ideally a screening test would only find the clinically significant aggressive cancers, thereby not subjecting men to repeated negative biopsies, overdiagnosis and overtreatment. As a result, the medical community has recently recommended against the use of PSA for prostate cancer screening. If you were to use MRI with PSA, we may see the performance of PSA improve. Also it may be that some day MRI could be an opportunity for screening by itself. Breast cancer screening is solely based on imaging via mammography.&nbsp; Some types of colon cancer screening are also based on imaging, in one example via direct visualization of the tumor during colonoscopy.&nbsp; In a similar fashion one could imagine a day when based on a man&rsquo;s family history, health status, and risk factors for prostate cancer, he could have a prostate MRI at a certain age and, if negative, have repeat imaging at some later dates, so he can avoid the many negative prostate biopsies caused by a high PSA.&nbsp; In men that we image at NIH, who are known to have prostate cancer detected by our MRI, it often takes two or three years for the tumor to change at all.&nbsp; MRI helps us better select those men for active surveillance who do not need to treat their prostate cancer and to avoid the frequent biopsies that are required without the use of prostate MRIs.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Wood:</b> The real interesting stuff is the patients who are currently, maybe, some would say, over-treated by radiation or surgery. Perhaps those patients who had non-aggressive prostate cancer can go on active surveillance, and can be potentially monitored with MRI. For certain patient populations, this technology has a huge impact. We&rsquo;ve seen a number of patients who had a decade of negative biopsies&mdash;six, seven, eight negative biopsies&mdash;but the tumors are just sitting in there. There they are, growing inside, and many times, very significant tumors. For those patients it&rsquo;s key.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Why does the involvement of NIH or NCI matter?</i></b></p>
<p><b>Choyke</b>: I once was told when I first got to NIH, &ldquo;Remember, it&rsquo;s the National Institutes of Health, not the National Institutes of Science.&rdquo; Our mission is to get this stuff out to the public. It doesn&rsquo;t do any good for us to just publish in our academic journals.</p>

The need for a more modern, comprehensive understanding led, in part, to the launch in 2006 of The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), a joint venture supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both part of NIH.</p><p>From the outset, TCGA has been generating and analyzing data according to the organ in the body from which a tumor first arose. By 2014 the TCGA Research Network had published nearly a dozen papers examining genomic changes in tumor types, including two manuscripts in the summer of 2014 on gastric and lung adenocarcinomas each a comprehensive characterization of a type of cancer. The organ-specific findings have been revealing, providing new information on cancer development and behavior, as well as new insights into molecular pathways and genetic alterations.</p><p>Just as importantly, in many cases, researchers have uncovered shared molecular patterns among cancers, including similar genomic changes occurring across tumor types. For example, TCGA&#8217;s 2012 breast cancer analysis found evidence that a subtype of breast cancer shows marked similarity to a form of ovarian cancer. The subtype, basal-like breast cancer, and high-grade serous ovarian cancer shared similar mutation characteristics as well as other genomic features, suggesting that the two cancers are of a similar molecular origin and may respond to the same treatments. In fact, basal-like breast cancer has more similarities, genomically speaking, to high-grade serous ovarian cancer than to other subtypes of breast cancer.</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5460402" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="2090" sys_dependentid="641737">

</figure>
  	</div><p>In addition, data from TCGA&#8217;s analyses show that most cancer types possess a great number of mutations that occur at a low frequency. The collection of mutations has been termed the &#8220;long tail&#8221; because in a graph of the frequency of specific changes, they represent a lengthy but low section of the chart. Scientists have found that some of these mutations are shared by sets of tumor types. The long tail and the shared inter-tumor molecular patterns are the first suggestions that a cross-tumor analysis may yield clinically meaningful new findings.</p><p>With such similarities increasingly apparent, TCGA researchers developed a formal project for a cross-tumor analysis, called the Pan-Cancer project. Its goal was to assemble TCGA&#8217;s wealth of data across tumor types, analyze and interpret those data, and finally, make both the analyses and the data available. The group, led by Joshua M. Stuart, Ph.D., University of California Santa Cruz, analyzed 12 cancer types, whose selection was based upon numbers of samples available and comprehensiveness of the data as of 2012. The 12 types were glioblastoma multiforme, acute myeloid leukemia, lung squamous cell carcinoma, lung adenocarcinoma, colon and rectal adenocarcinomas, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma and ovarian, breast, clear cell kidney, endometrial and bladder cancers. Because of the breadth and depth of TCGA data, the Pan-Cancer group believed the analysis would have statistical power to detect genomic changes across the cancers, find changes specific to each organ-of-origin, and identify molecular commonalities across tumor types.</p><p>The culmination of this effort has been a series of manuscripts tied together through &#8220;threads&#8221; featured on the website of<i>Nature</i> (see <a href="http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n10/full/ng.2780.html">http://www.nature.com/ng/journal/v45/n10/full/ng.2780.html</a>), similar to what was done for papers resulting from the similarly expansive project, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE). Each thread is centered on a specific theme and comprises relevant information across papers and journals. &#8220;Each cross-cutting piece offers perspectives on a topic discussed in several papers. This is a new exciting way to organize information to help bring out themes that unite the work,&#8221; Dr. Stuart said. To this purpose, Dr. Stuart described the genesis, makeup, goals and promise of the Pan-Cancer project in a commentary online Sept. 26, 2013, in <i>Nature Genetics.</i> As TCGA collects and analyzes more samples, researchers continue to &#160;be better able to detect rare mutations that apply to numerous tumor types.</p><p>This new perspective of analyzing cancers according to their genomic profiles signals a shift away from organizing cancer by organ of origin. Many clinicians are beginning to imagine a future where cancers are described by their mutations, such as an <i>ERBB2</i> amplified tumor or a PI3K-pathway mutant carcinoma. As Dr. Stuart wrote in the <i>Nature Genetics</i> perspective article, which accompanied two of the group of Pan-Cancer research papers, &#8220;Only time will tell whether the integration of molecular characteristics with data on histology, organ site and metastatic location will contribute to an improvement in patient outcomes. But the balance is shifting in this direction.&#8221;</p><p>Two research papers published in <i>Nature Genetics</i> as part of the first round of Pan-Cancer papers point to the benefits from this type of cross-cancer analysis. In one paper, researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, analyzed data on more than 3,000 tumor samples from 12 cancer types from TCGA, and determined that a limited number of genetic alterations are responsible for most cancer subtypes. These alterations, no matter what tissue they originated in, fall into two general categories of &#8220;oncogenic&#8221; signatures: genetic mutations and copy number changes (changes in the number of copies of genes in a cell), with many smaller subclasses. The scientists hope that these results will eventually help to tailor treatment strategies to subsets of patients, resulting in clinical trials based on matching individual patients whose tumors have been profiled &#8211; and oncogenic signatures identified and classified &#8211; with a corresponding drug or combination of therapies.</p><p>The second study examined patterns of changes in the number of gene copies in cells, one of the most common types of mutations that lead to cancer. Investigators at The Broad Institute, Cambridge, Mass., and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston, and elsewhere, compiled a database of gene copy number changes across genes in 5,000 tumors and 12 cancer types. They used this database to identify 140 regions where these mutations tend to occur most often, pointing to genes in these regions that are likely to contribute to cancer formation. The scientists showed that the patterns of mutations can provide clues as to how these genes contribute to cancer. These findings clarify how cancers develop, identify genes that are particularly important in cancer initiation and may serve as effective therapeutic targets.</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5460403" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="2090" sys_dependentid="642099">

  	</div><p>The Pan-Cancer project also suggests directions for the future of cross-tumor analysis, several of which are highlighted in Dr. Stuart&#8217;s commentary article. These may include integrating data sources to increase the power of genomic analyses, using molecular profiles to categorize cancers for making treatment decisions, figuring out if &#8220;predictive signatures&#8221; derived from genes transcend tissue types and determining whether or not comprehensive protein analyses using tools such as mass spectrometry can extend the power of genomic analyses from TCGA.</p><p>In August 2014, two additional studies were published that provide even greater insight into Pan-Cancer efforts and TCGA data analyses collectively. In one of them, Dr. Stuart, Charles Perou, Ph.D. (University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill), and colleagues, used six different types of analyses to examine the molecular characteristics of more than 3,500 tumors across 12 different tumor types to see how they compared to each other. The researchers showed that the cancers were more likely to be genetically and molecularly similar based on the type of cell in which the cancer originated as opposed to the tissue type in which it originated.</p><p>In the study, investigators identified 11 integrated cancer subtypes. While many of the subtypes had molecular profiles linked to their tissue of origin, there were some subtypes that had to be split further, as tumors showed several different tissues of origin. For example, the study showed at least three different subtypes of bladder cancer, with one subtype closely resembling lung adenocarcinoma and another similar to head and neck and lung squamous cell cancers. The findings also confirmed differences in breast cancer subtypes and similarities to other cancers seen in earlier research. Basal-like breast cancers, the study found, looked more like ovarian cancer and cancers of squamous cell origin than other types of breast cancer. In revealing a new approach to classifying cancers, the authors suggest that at least one in 10 cancer patients could be classified differently by this new system.</p><p>In a second study, Roel Verhaak, Ph.D., M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and colleagues reported results in the journal <i>Oncogene</i> suggesting that cancers from all origins can be classified according to a limited set of gene expression &#8220;footprints.&#8221; The researchers compared subtypes of gene expression across 12 tumor types. They identified eight gene expression &#8220;superclusters&#8221; characterized by the types of disease pathways that are commonly turned on in cancer, and similarities in the kinds of genes expressed. The investigators found, for example, that one of the largest superclusters involved an increase in the number of mutations in <i>TP53</i>, a commonly altered gene that promotes cell growth and proliferation. The supercluster was also marked by an absence of the gene <i>CDKN2A</i>, which helps control cell proliferation, increased numbers of DNA double strand breaks &#8211; a hallmark of many types of cancer &#8211; and higher-than-usual expression of cyclin B1 protein, which plays a role in cell division. These kinds of changes affect the cell&#8217;s DNA damage control response, and can turn on certain cell pathways that contribute to cancer development.</p><p>The researchers also saw a second pattern in nine of 11 solid tumor types they examined. They found a gene expression subtype related to tumor-associated stroma, which can provide a matrix on which tumors can grow, and can affect cancer growth. Taken together, these results suggest that tumors can be grouped according to their gene expression similarities as seen across tumor types, pointing to a limited number of molecular themes in cancer.</p><p>While follow-up studies are needed to confirm these findings and additional tumor samples and tumor types will expand the work, this past year&#8217;s worth of initial PanCancer-12 analyses lays the groundwork for a more detailed classification of tumors that include molecularly defined subtypes, unlike all prior cancer classification systems.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>At this year&rsquo;s annual American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) meeting in San Diego there were plenary talks by two NCI intramural scientists -- Steven Rosenberg, M.D., and Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D.&nbsp; Intramural research, which takes place mostly on the NCI main campus in Bethesda, Md, comprises about 15 percent of all NCI-funded research efforts.</p>
<p>The two intramural scientists highlighted the challenges in developing varied and potentially synergistic treatments for aggressive forms of cancer. Each researcher has been focusing primarily on a particularly difficult to treat cancer (melanoma and lymphoma, respectively) for several decades, and their presentations highlight the diligence and tenacity needed to come to a better understanding of the cancer process and to find effective agents to target the diseases they study.&nbsp; They are certainly not undertaking these efforts in a vacuum as the other 85 percent of NCI&rsquo;s research funding, to extramural scientists, is also supporting similar research efforts.</p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg, chief of NCI&rsquo;s Surgery Branch, focused on the curative potential of adoptive T-cell therapy (ACT) in his presentation. This experimental therapy attempts to enhance the cancer-fighting ability of a patient&rsquo;s immune system using the patient&rsquo;s own natural or genetically engineered T-lymphocytes, which are cells that play a central role in fighting infection. In one form of this therapy, researchers first harvest T-cells that have invaded a patient&rsquo;s tumor, called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (or TILs). The TILs with the greatest antitumor activity are identified and large populations of those cells are grown in a laboratory. The patients are treated to destroy their own immune cells, and the laboratory-grown TILs are then infused back into the patient, where they attack and destroy cancer cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Adoptive T-cell therapy using TILs has been particularly effective in treating metastatic melanoma patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;This treatment approach was first developed in 1988 by Dr. Rosenberg.&nbsp; Its efficiency was enhanced in 2002 based on results from an NCI intramural clinical trial that showed that it was necessary to deplete the patient&rsquo;s immune system before TIL transfer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In his plenary talk, Dr. Rosenberg reported newly available long-term follow-up data (a median of 9 years) for 93 patients with metastatic melanoma treated with ACT.&nbsp; In more than half of the patients (52 patients) the cancer regressed, and in 20 of these patients the cancer regressed completely (with all but one remaining in complete remission as of the AACR 2014 meeting).</p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg also reported results of his recent confirmatory trial involving 101 patients with metastatic melanoma, in which 55 patients treated with ACT-based therapy exhibited cancer regression. This 54 percent response rate exceeds that seen in patients with metastatic melanoma treated with two other types of immunotherapy (ipilimumab and anti-PD1 therapy, which showed response rates of about 10 percent and 35 percent, respectively). Moreover, ACT was effective in patients who were not responsive to these other treatments.</p>
<p>Although the primary focus of much of the research in Dr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s lab and clinic has focused on melanoma, he is also working on extending TIL and other cell-based therapies to other malignancies. These include B-cell lymphoma, the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma; leukemia; and other lymphomas.</p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s group was the first to report the use of genetically modified T-cells to successfully treat patients with advanced lymphoma. In his plenary talk, he described updated results for 18 adult patients who had indolent and aggressive B-cell lymphomas who had not responded to other therapies. Sixteen patients saw their cancer regress and eight patients experienced a complete regression. The finding that patients who were unable to respond to other treatments responded well to ACT reinforces an overall theme of the need for alternate approaches and synergistic therapies.</p>

<p>B-cell associated cancers and the challenges in treating them were the focus of the presentation by Dr. Louis Staudt, head of NCI&rsquo;s Molecular Biology of Lymphoid Malignancies Section. His talk was on rationally targeted therapy for diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCLs), which constitute 30 to 40 percent of newly diagnosed lymphomas. In 2000, Dr. Staudt and colleagues, using DNA microarray technology that was relatively advanced for that time, found that this type of lymphoma was actually two distinct diseases. In the past 14 years, his group has developed a better molecular understanding of the disease, and they now know that there are at least three molecular subtypes of DLBCL, each derived from B cells at unique stages in their development. The activated B-cell (ABC) subtype of DLBCL, which accounts for approximately 40 percent of DLBCL cases and has the poorest clinical outcome with current therapy, is a primary focus of current research efforts.</p>
<p>Researchers in Dr. Staudt&rsquo;s group have recently been looking for ways to target B-cell receptor signaling as a treatment strategy because this signaling appears to be a key part of the disease process.&nbsp;This research identified the enzyme Bruton&rsquo;s tyrosine kinase (BTK) as a critical component in the B-cell receptor signaling pathway that is required to maintain the survival of ABC lymphoma cells. Based on this molecular research, the investigators chose the drug ibrutinib, a potent inhibitor of BTK, to use in their clinical trials.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In studies led by Staudt and his NCI colleague, Wyndham Wilson, M.D., ibrutinib was first evaluated in patients with ABC DLBCL who enrolled in a pilot trial at NCI.&nbsp;The results showed that use of the single-agent pill form of ibrutinib elicited major anti-lymphoma effects with minimal side effects.&nbsp;A multicenter phase 2 trial of ibrutinib, first reported at AACR in 2012, has shown a high rate of response in ABC but not in another form of DLBCL, as hypothesized, highlighting the need to find other, potentially synergistic, approaches to treating the cancer.&nbsp;<br /><br />In his plenary talk, Dr. Staudt delved into the molecular mechanisms in ABC DLBCL that may account for the high rate of response to ibrutinib. The tumor cells of some patients have a mutation in the <i>CD79B</i> gene, which codes for a component of the B cell receptor. When this gene is mutated, ABC DLBCL tumors are more responsive to ibrutinib. However, ibrutinib was effective against many tumors that did not have a mutation affecting the B cell receptor, leading Dr. Staudt to propose that this receptor may be triggered by other, perhaps non-genetic, mechanisms in these patients.</p>
<p>While some patients who received ibrutinib remain in complete remission for more than one year, Dr. Staudt noted that most patients who responded eventually relapse, necessitating combination therapies to improve ibrutinib effectiveness.&nbsp; He emphasized that ibrutinib is likely to be a good cornerstone for combination therapy since it has few, if any, side effects in most individuals treated.&nbsp; The key concept behind combination therapy, illustrated below, is that cancer cells typically have more than one mechanism to abnormally sustain their survival, and successful therapy must block most or all of these survival pathways.&nbsp; In addition, the cancer cell may respond to one drug therapy by devising an &ldquo;end run&rdquo; in which a compensatory survival pathway is activated.&nbsp; Combination therapies will have to anticipate these compensatory mechanisms to be successful.&nbsp;</p>

</div>
<p>Consequently, Dr. Staudt&rsquo;s research team has looked for other drugs or substances that might act synergistically with ibrutinib to kill ABC DLBCL cells.&nbsp; They have found that substances known as IRAK4 inhibitors, BET inhibitors, and the drug lenalidomide might all be effective co-agents. Ultimately, this paradigm illustrates the difficulty of developing clinical trials for combination therapies where there are tens or even hundreds of possible combinations to consider. Extensive preclinical research will be needed to identify the most promising combination or combinations of therapies to move forward to clinical trials.</p>
<p>Both Drs. Rosenberg&rsquo;s and Staudt&rsquo;s research teams continue to refine their understanding of the diseases they&rsquo;ve been studying over the past several decades. In addition to these two high-profile plenary talks, NCI researchers and staff provided a variety of insights and perspectives at various discussions during the 5-day AACR meeting. <!--To find information about specific presentations, please go to <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/researchandfunding/meetings/2014aacr?cid=WTaacr_cgov13">http://www.cancer.gov/researchandfunding/meetings/2014aacr</a>.--></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Need for Clinical Trials Reform</span></b></p>
<p>Clinical trials are pivotal elements in the conversion of scientific discoveries into practical means to prevent and treat cancers. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) has supported clinical trials in this country and around the world for more than half a century; clinical trials and the patients who participate in them are integral parts of the National Cancer Program.&nbsp; In this statement, we outline changes that are now being made in the enterprises that conduct clinical trials under the auspices of NCI.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">The Cooperative Groups</span></b></p>
<p>The major clinical trials enterprise in the United States, called the Clinical Trials Cooperative Group Program, has grown, but its design has remained largely unchanged for 55 years.&nbsp; Recognizing that our clinical trials must keep pace with advances in the scientific understanding of cancer, the Institute of Medicine (IOM) issued a <a href="http://iom.edu/Reports/2010/A-National-Cancer-Clinical-Trials-System-for-the-21st-Century-Reinvigorating-the-NCI-Cooperative.aspx">report</a> at NCI&rsquo;s request in 2010 that outlined necessary, systematic changes to more efficiently design, review, and conduct studies.</p>
<p>In keeping with the recommendations outlined in the IOM report and with the advice of clinical scientists from across the country, NCI has created a new National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN).&nbsp; The NCTN will improve the speed and efficiency of cancer clinical trials, using fewer but larger groups of investigators and distributing resources in a more effective way.&nbsp; In addition to supporting the new network&rsquo;s clinical trial groups with awards for operations and statistical analysis, the NCTN provides funding for a centralized Institutional Review Board (IRB); for correlative studies (through the <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=478613&amp;sys_revision=31&amp;sys_variantid=1764&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_folderid="" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="478613" sys_dependentvariantid="1764" sys_relationshipid="6219678">Biomarker, Imaging, and Quality-of-Life Studies Funding Program</a>); for new awards created specifically for the NCTN, including Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) grants and Integrated Translational Science Awards (ITSA); and for additional contracts to support the infrastructure of the network (e.g., pharmacy services and regulatory support).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Despite the current budget environment in which NCI is operating&mdash;at levels of appropriated funds below those of FY2010&mdash;our monetary support for clinical trials remains strong.&nbsp; In FY2013, NCI singled out its national clinical trials program as an area that would not incur any budget reductions, despite sequestration.&nbsp; This year (FY2014), funding levels for clinical trials are unchanged from FY2013.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The formal awards for the NCTN are expected to be made in the coming weeks.&nbsp; The capacity of the NCTN to conduct clinical trials will reflect the difficulties of supporting a large program that is constrained by higher mandatory costs and by the rate of biomedical inflation, despite approximately constant dollars.&nbsp; The number of trials that can be funded and the network&rsquo;s total enrollment (estimated to be about 17,000 patients in interventional trials and about 2,500 patients in trials that use molecular markers to screen for tumors) will be lower than in the past. These operational concessions are required to provide higher reimbursement rates per patient to the academic sites that are developing and performing trials, as recommended by the IOM report. (These higher rates will be approximately $4,000 per patient for about 50 percent of the patients accrued through the network accrual, compared with approximately $2,000 previously.)&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Community-based Clinical Trials</span></b></p>
<p>NCI also has a decades-long commitment to clinical cancer research in the community, where most cancer patients are treated and followed.&nbsp; Through programs such as the Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOPs), the Minority-based Community Clinical Oncology Program (MCCOPs), and the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP), NCI has developed and maintained the availability of state-of-the-art clinical research throughout the United States.</p>
<p>The value of community-based practices for providing access to clinical trials is fundamental to testing promising new interventions in settings in which most patients are seen.&nbsp; Because advances in oncology are occurring rapidly, community-based care must also adapt swiftly, requiring changes in the manner in which clinical trials are conducted in the community.&nbsp; Therefore, NCI is consolidating its several existing community-based programs into an NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), in a way that enables community-based programs to benefit from intellectual and operational resources available through the NCTN.&nbsp;</p>
<p>NCORP is designed to become an integral component of the overall NCI NCTN.&nbsp; It will provide access to studies of cancer control, prevention, screening, treatment, and cancer care delivery in the communities in which individuals live.&nbsp; NCORP will be comprised of some of the sites formerly funded through the CCOPs, MCCOPs, and NCCCP, as well new grantee institutions, in accord with advice received from many sectors during the planning process.</p>
<p>During the transition to NCORP, we expect to announce most awards before the planned September 2014 date, avoiding disruption in existing community-based sites that successfully compete for NCORP awards.&nbsp; Existing sites that are not successful in the competition for NCORP awards will receive funds needed to ensure a smooth closeout of operations. &nbsp;In accord with traditional NCI practice, no patients will be removed from a trial as a result of the reorganization, and accrual into existing studies will continue.&nbsp; The NCI&rsquo;s long-term goal remains the maintenance of a strong program for community-based clinical research.</p>

<p>Dear Colleagues,</p>
<p>As you are aware, the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is in the process of combining its two community-based research networks to create a single network that builds on the strengths of the Community Clinical Oncology Program/Minority-Based Community Clinical Oncology Program (CCOPs) and the NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP). This network, the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), will support a wide range of clinical research, including treatment-focused as well as cancer prevention and control&ndash;based clinical trials; population-based studies; and behavioral, health services, and outcomes research. It will encompass community-based cancer specialty organizations in the same manner as have the CCOPs and NCCCP, and will work closely with the <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=725920&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_folderid="" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="725920" sys_dependentvariantid="704" sys_relationshipid="6219703">National Clinical Trials Network</a> (NCTN).</p>
<p>The transition to any new large clinical research structure is never easy either for the agency administering it or for those people and institutions applying to participate in it. The creation of the NCORP is no exception. Some of the difficulties are easily mitigated but others require greater efforts to ensure that the fundamental principles and values of clinical research are upheld. NCI remains fully committed to these principles, most especially our obligation to patients.</p>
<p>Current NCI grantees conducting community-based clinical research have voiced concerns about the maintenance of funding between the end of the current round of annual CCOP awards (June 1, 2014) and the start of the NCORP (now estimated to be August 1, 2014). With Fiscal Year 2014 budgets now in place, our grantees can be assured that NCI will fund all CCOPs at their current levels during this period. While this was always our intention, this has not been clearly communicated. Furthermore, currently funded investigators should continue the active, uninterrupted accrual of patients to new or ongoing clinical trials during this interval. As in the past, full funding for all research activities required to carry out approved studies will be provided.</p>
<p>Those CCOP/MB-CCOP institutions that successfully compete to become NCORP members should have a seamless stream of funding as the new consortium structure commences. NCI will work with sites that either do not successfully compete for an NCORP award or choose not to transition into the new network. NCI will make funds available, as necessary, to assist these sites to implement their affiliation with another site or to carry out the process of closing their NCI-supported activities. For those sites, decisions will be made on a case-by-case basis, in accord with factors such as accrual rates and number of patients in follow up. NCI remains committed to every patient enrolled in a clinical trial and will ensure that they continue to have the opportunity to receive the full benefit of those trials.</p>
<p>The CCOPs and MB-CCOPs, including their dedicated physicians and staff, have played an essential role in the national clinical trials enterprise. An effective transition into NCORP, along with the continued care of patients, will be an important measure of the new network&rsquo;s success. We must work together to adapt swiftly and effectively to achieve the goals of the new system&mdash;namely, to take advantage of recent advances in our understanding of cancer and to bring new knowledge into clinical trials conducted in the community. Our patients deserve nothing less.</p>

<p>Adult patients with a type of cancer known as Burkitt lymphoma had excellent long-term survival rates—upwards of 90 percent—following treatment with low-intensity chemotherapy regimens, according to a new clinical trial finding. Standard treatment for Burkitt lymphoma involves high-dose chemotherapy, which has a high rate of toxicity, including death, and cures only 60 percent of adult patients.&#160; This trial was conducted by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and appeared Nov. 14, 2013, in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>

<p>Burkitt lymphoma is the most aggressive type of lymphoma, which is a cancer that begins in cells of the immune system.&#160; It is more common in equatorial Africa than in Western countries.&#160; In Uganda, for example, the estimated prevalence of Burkitt lymphoma is between 5 and 20 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, whereas in the United States, according to NCI’s statistical database for 2001-2009, prevalence was 0.4 cases per 100,000 inhabitants.&#160; Cure rates for Burkitt lymphoma in Western countries approach 90 percent in children, which is higher than adult cure rates seen prior to this new approach to treatment, whereas only 30 percent to 50 percent of children in Africa are cured due to an inability to safely administer high-dose treatment.&#160; Thus, there is an important need for less toxic and more effective therapies.</p>

<p>Wyndham H. Wilson M.D. Ph.D., head of NCI’s Lymphoma Therapeutics Section, and colleagues conducted the trial at NIH’s Clinical Center.&#160; The trial involved two variants of EPOCH-R, a chemotherapy regimen that includes the drugs etoposide (E), prednisone (P), vincristine (Oncovin), cyclophosphamide (C), doxorubicin (Hydrodoxorubicin), and rituximab (R). EPOCH-R involves longer exposures to lower concentrations of drugs instead of briefer exposures to higher concentrations of drugs. Previously, Wilson’s team found that EPOCH-R was very effective for treating mediastinal B-cell lymphoma, a disease that is distinct from Burkitt lymphoma.</p>

<p>Thirty patients with previously untreated Burkitt lymphoma were included in the trial. The patients received one of the two EPOCH-R variants, depending on their HIV status. &#160;&#160;Burkitt is a disease that occurs frequently in immune-suppressed AIDS patients. Nineteen HIV-negative patients received dose-adjusted (DA)-EPOCH-R, whereas 11 HIV-positive patients received SC-EPOCH-RR, which is a short-course (SC) variant of EPOCH-R that includes two doses of rituximab per treatment cycle and has a lower treatment intensity than DA-EPOCH-R.&#160; Adjustment of dose levels is done to try to provide the optimum amount of drug based on a person’s tolerance of chemotherapy. &#160;The median age of the patients was 33 years old and most had intermediate- or high-risk disease. The principal toxicities seen in the trial were fever and neutropenia (low white blood cell counts); no treatment-related deaths occurred. With median follow-up times of 86 and 73 months, the overall survival rates were 100 percent and 90 percent, respectively, with DA-EPOCH-R and SC-EPOCH-RR.</p>

<p>“The toxicity of EPOCH-R-based treatment in Burkitt lymphoma is considerably less than that reported with standard Burkitt regimens,” said Wilson. “Furthermore, these two regimens were highly effective in adult patients, who have significantly worse outcomes than children.”&#160;</p>

<p>“These promising results with low-toxicity treatment suggest that this approach may be effective and worth investigating <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"> </a>in certain geographic and economically challenged regions where Burkitt lymphoma is highly prevalent as well as in adult populations,” said Kieron Dunleavy M.D., NCI, and first author of the study.</p>

<p>Based on these results, two trials to confirm the efficacy of EPOCH-R therapy in adult and pediatric Burkitt lymphoma patients are under way.</p>

<p>This trial is registered at <a href="http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00001337?term=NCT00001337&#38;rank=1">http://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00001337?term=NCT00001337&#38;rank=1</a> as NCT00001337 and NCT00006436 and was funded by the intramural program at NCI.</p>

<p>Significant improvement with the use of a combination drug therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer was reported at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) meeting in Chicago today (late breaking abstract #5500). This is the first ovarian cancer study to use a combination of drugs that could be taken orally. The drugs were tested in a phase I combination study followed by a randomized phase 2 trial sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The trial compared the activity of a combination of the drug olaparib (which blocks DNA repair) and the blood vessel inhibitor drug cediranib, vs. olaparib alone. Trial results showed a near doubling of progression-free survival benefit (the length of time during and after treatment that the cancer did not get worse) for the combination therapy over use of the single drug alone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The findings of this study are exciting because they support the idea that combining these two targeted oral therapies results in significant activity in ovarian cancer, more so than olaparib alone,&rdquo; said Joyce Liu, M.D., M.P.H., the lead investigator and medical oncologist at the <a href="http://www.dana-farber.org/Adult-Care/Treatment-and-Support/Treatment-Centers-and-Clinical-Services/Susan-F--Smith-Center-for-Women-s-Cancers.aspx">Susan F. Smith Center for Women's Cancers</a> at <a href="http://www.dana-farber.org/">Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a>, Boston. &ldquo;We are looking forward to further exploring this combination in ovarian cancer and potentially increasing effective treatment options for our patients with this cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over 22,000 cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed annually in the United States. Seventy-five percent of the cancers are classified as high-grade serous type, the women have more advanced disease at diagnosis, and their tumors are more aggressive. Of this high-grade type, about three-quarters of patients respond to initial treatment but nearly all will recur and need follow-up treatment. That treatment will be based on how the cancers have responded to previous therapies and are broken down into two categories based on patients&rsquo; responses to chemotherapy regimens that include platinum:</p>
<ul>
<li>Platinum-Sensitive &ndash; these are patients most likely to benefit from Poly ADP-Ribose Polymerase (PARP) inhibition. &nbsp;PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, are targeted drugs that block an enzyme involved in many functions in the cell, including the repair of DNA damage.</li>
<li>Platinum-Resistant &ndash; these are patients whose disease recurred within six months of completion of conventional chemotherapy (using the drugs cisplatin or carboplatin) and are generally less responsive to subsequent treatments and have not responded as well to PARP inhibitors.&nbsp; They are currently treated with non-platinum chemotherapy, single-agents, with or without addition of the blood vessel inhibitor drug called bevacizumab.</li>
</ul>
<p>An anti-angiogenic agent, or blood vessel inhibitor called cediranib (which inhibits a protein known as VEGFR) and olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, are each clinically active in recurrent ovarian cancer. Preclinical laboratory studies suggest these agents add to and enhance the activity of each other, and an early phase 1 study showed that the combination of cediranib and olaparib was well-tolerated with minimal side effects.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For this reason, 90 patients from nine centers were randomly assigned to one of two study arms for the phase II clinical trial: the first taking capsules of olaparib (400 milligrams [mg] twice daily) and the other taking a combination of the two drugs (200 mg olaparib in capsule form twice daily and 30 mg of cediranib by tablets once daily). The study arms were stratified by <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>BRCA gene mutation status and receipt of prior anti-angiogenic therapy. The BRCA gene is one of the most commonly mutated genes in breast cancer.</p>
<p>Patients, whose median age was 58, were enrolled from October 2011 to June 2013.&nbsp; As of March 2014, median progression-free survival was 9.2 months for olaparib and 17.7 months for the combination therapy, which is a significant advantage. The overall rate of toxicity was higher for patients on the combination therapy. Fatigue, diarrhea, and hypertension were the most common toxic effects, all of which were manageable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of particular note is the fact that both drugs used in this trial are in pill form and could offer an alternative to intravenous chemotherapy,&rdquo; said Percy Ivy, M.D., associate chief of NCI&rsquo;s Investigational Drug Branch.&nbsp; &ldquo;Therefore, this combination therapy could be used anywhere in the world where patients can be safely monitored for the side-effects of olaparib and cediranib, such as diarrhea and hypertension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Based on these results, two phase 3 trials are being planned for platinum-sensitive and platinum-resistant ovarian cancer patients by one of NCI&rsquo;s new National Cancer Trial Network Groups, the NRG Oncology Group (formerly 3 cooperative groups: the&nbsp; National Surgical Adjuvant Breast and Bowel Project (NSABP), the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), and the Gynecologic Oncology Group (GOG).</p>
<p>This trial was funded by NCI and received supplementary funds from the Recovery Act.&nbsp;</p>

Women receiving the injections were only about one-third as likely to experience ovarian failure, a common long-term toxicity of chemotherapy treatments, and were more than twice as likely to have a normal pregnancy after their cancer treatment compared to women in the trial who did not receive the injections.</p><p>In POEMS, premenopausal women with hormone-receptor negative breast cancer ages 18 to 49 were randomly assigned to receive standard chemotherapy with or without goserelin every four weeks. Goserelin is a drug that disrupts the body&#8217;s hormonal feedback systems, resulting in reduced estrogen production, which puts the women into a chemical menopause. Under usual use, that chemical menopause is reversible; POEMS was carried out to see if the treatment allowed the women to recover fertility after cancer treatment while not interfering with the cancer treatment itself.</p><p>The researchers compared the ovarian failure rate of the women two years after entering the study and found that 22 percent of patients on the standard therapy had ovarian failure (15 of 69 patients) compared to 8 percent of those who also had goserelin treatment (5 of &#160;66 patients). Of the 218 patients enrolled in the trial, 12 patients on the standard arm (11 percent) became pregnant vs 22 patients on the goserelin treatment arm (21 percent).&#160;</p><p>&quot;This trial was the first demonstration of improved fertility prospects and more successful pregnancies when goserelin was used,&#8221; said Halle Moore, M.D., Cleveland Clinical Foundation and the lead investigator for POEMS. &#8220;Premenopausal women beginning chemotherapy for early breast cancer should consider this new option to prevent premature ovarian failure.&#8221;</p><p>The trial was conducted by SWOG, one of NCI&#8217;s five National Clinical Trial Network groups, with the collaboration of the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group and the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, and international access provided through the International Breast Cancer Study Group which includes the Australia New Zealand Breast Cancer Group.&#160;</p><p>The standard approach to preserving fertility in young female cancer patients is to harvest and store ovarian tissue, ovarian follicles, or embryos prior to cancer treatment. &#8220;Finding a simple and accessible way to protect fertility in young breast cancer patients while not harming cancer outcomes is an important issue,&#8221; said Lori Minasian, M.D., deputy director of the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention and one of the researchers on POEMS. &#160;</p><p>Fertility-preserving treatment was not expected to have an effect on cancer outcomes and this data was analyzed only to ensure there were no detrimental effects from that treatment. &#160;&#160;</p><p>In the United States alone almost 49,000 women under age 50 are diagnosed with invasive breast cancer each year; nearly 11,000 of those are under age 40.

<p>The study was conducted by the International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBSCG), in partnership with the Breast International Group (BIG) and the North American Breast Cancer Group, and funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute (NCI), IBSCG, and the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer and Ipsen.&#160; The combined results of the TEXT (Tamoxifen and Exemestane Trial) and SOFT (Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial) were presented today at the 2014 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting in Chicago (late breaking abstract #1) and published online in the New England Journal of Medicine<i>.</i></p>

<p>Treatment with exemestane plus ovarian function suppression reduced the risk of any invasive cancer by 28 percent, and reduced the risk of invasive breast cancer recurrence by 34 percent, compared to treatment with tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression. At five years from study entry, 92.8 percent of women remained free from breast cancer after treatment with exemestane plus ovarian function suppression; 88.8 percent were breast cancer-free after receiving tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression.</p>

<p>Treatment with an aromatase inhibitor, such as exemestane, has previously been demonstrated to benefit postmenopausal breast cancer patients compared to treatment with tamoxifen. &#160;Aromatase inhibitors prevent the formation of estradiol, a female hormone, by interfering with an aromatase enzyme. Both trials were conducted to determine whether this benefit could be extended to premenopausal women by combining exemestane with ovarian function suppression. &#160;Hormone-sensitive breast cancer, defined as estrogen and/or progesterone receptor-positive breast cancer, represents 79 percent of breast cancers diagnosed in women under age 50 in the United States.</p>

<p>The TEXT and SOFT trials were phase III, randomized clinical trials that enrolled 2,672 and 3,066 premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early breast cancer, respectively, between November 2003 and April 2011. Over 500 medical institutions from 27 countries enrolled women in the trials. In the two trials, 4,690 women were randomly assigned to 5 years of adjuvant, or post-surgical, treatment with exemestane plus ovarian function suppression or assigned to tamoxifen plus ovarian function suppression. SOFT included a third treatment assignment, tamoxifen alone, which will be analyzed in late 2014. The women may also have received chemotherapy as part of adjuvant treatment.</p>

<p>The two trials were designed to be complementary. They were conducted over the same time period, in the same general population, and have the two treatments in common. Combining them brought the results to doctors and patients sooner than if they were presented separately.</p>

<p>Ovarian function suppression has been used for decades as a breast cancer treatment for premenopausal women, though whether it adds benefit when combined with other treatments was still uncertain. In these trials ovarian function suppression was combined with either tamoxifen or exemestane. In premenopausal women use of an aromatase inhibitor such as exemestane requires suppression of estrogen produced by the ovaries. In TEXT and SOFT, ovarian function suppression was achieved by use of monthly injections of the GnRH agonist triptorelin, surgical removal of both ovaries, or radiation therapy to the ovaries.</p>

<p>“These results provide a new treatment option for young women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer. The trials demonstrate that an aromatase inhibitor, previously recommended only for postmenopausal women, is also effective for premenopausal women when combined with ovarian function suppression,” said study co-chair Olivia Pagani, M.D., Breast Unit Clinical Director at the Oncology Institute of Southern Switzerland in Bellinzona, Switzerland. “As a physician who routinely recommends ovarian function suppression as adjuvant therapy for some young patients, these results will change my practice. I will combine ovarian function suppression with an aromatase inhibitor rather than with tamoxifen.”</p>

<p>Support from NCI enabled American and Canadian participation in the TEXT and SOFT trials through the North American Breast Cancer Group (NABCG). NABCG contributed one-third of all patient enrollments in the TEXT and SOFT trials, whereas two-thirds enrolled from cooperative oncology groups affiliated with the Breast International Group (BIG) network. Led by Alliance (formerly CALGB), North American involvement accelerated trial recruitment, permitting earlier reporting of findings and faster access to these practice-changing results.</p>

<p>In addition to assessing the effectiveness of the treatments at reducing recurrence, patient-reported quality of life assessments were collected throughout the five years as well as physician-reported side effects. “As clinicians we should be reassured that, in the two treatments studied, the patient-reported quality of life results were similar overall, as was the frequency of severe side effects,” said study co-chair Barbara Walley, M.D., Medical Oncologist at the Tom Baker Cancer Centre in Calgary, Canada and executive member of the Breast Disease Site Committee, National Cancer Institute of Canada-Clinical Trials Group. “The side effects reported in this premenopausal population are similar to those in postmenopausal women in which tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors are widely prescribed.” &#160;Follow-up of the young women participating in the trials continues to assess long-term prognosis, tolerability, and side effects.</p>

<p>“These results underscore the importance of international research collaboration in improving patient outcomes in North America and beyond, such as for the young women in this study,” said Richard Gelber, Ph.D., professor, Harvard Medical School and director, IBCSG Statistical Center, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston. “This partnership between NCI and IBCSG represents a successful model for future clinical research advances.”</p>

Chaperone proteins, such as TRAP1, help other proteins adapt to stress, but scientists are coming to appreciate that they have other functions as well, such as, in this case, affecting tumor development. It is known that some cancers express more TRAP1, while others, such as bladder and renal cancer, express little. The cancer development aspect was not the primary goal of the study, however, which was to determine the role TRAP1 played in regulating mitochondrial activity in the cell. The mitochondria&#8217;s main job is energy conversion within the cell. The study, headed by Len Neckers, Ph.D., of NCI&#8217;s Urologic Oncology Branch, appears online the week of April 1, 2013, in PNAS. &#160;&#160;</p><p>As part of this work, Neckers and his colleagues developed human cell lines in which TRAP1 was not expressed. They then used these cell lines, as well as cells from laboratory mice, to study mitochondrial metabolism. They determined that TRAP1 regulates the balance between mitochondrial respiration and glycolysis, processes which help break down elements in the cell to produce energy. They found excess expression of TRAP1 directly suppressed mitochondrial respiration and indirectly increased glycolysis, while reduced TRAP1 expression had the opposite effect. Ultimately, the ability of TRAP1 to modulate mitochondrial metabolism affected both the way the cells produced energy and synthesis of nucleic acids, proteins and lipids. The scientists noted that cells with reduced TRAP1 were hyperenergetic&#8212;and were much more invasive compared to the same cells with excess TRAP1 expression. As a result of their findings, the scientists believe that pharmacologic targeting of mitochondrial chaperones, such as TRAP1, may represent a novel strategy to alter <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a> how cells utilize nutrients to make energy and cellular building blocks. Further, as a consequence of TRAP1&#8217;s effect on nutrient metabolism and energy production, it appears that TRAP1 also may play an unexpected, but important, role in controlling cancer metastasis.</p></div>]]></row>

Squamous cell carcinoma represents about a quarter of all lung cancer diagnoses, but there are currently few treatment options beyond surgery for the disease. The trial will use genomic profiling to match patients to one of several different investigational treatments that are designed to target the genomic alterations found to be driving the growth of their cancer. This innovative approach to clinical testing should both improve access to promising drugs for patients and ease the significant recruitment and infrastructure burdens on researchers involved in traditional clinical trials.</p><p style=" text-align: left;">&#8220;This diverse, collaborative approach, with support from leading lung cancer advocacy organizations, helps to ensure that the needs of patients, clinicians, developers, and regulators are all considered in the design and operation of the trial,&#8221; said Dr. Ellen Sigal, Chair &amp; Founder of Friends of Cancer Research.</p><p style=" text-align: left;">The trial will initially test five experimental drugs&#8212;four targeted therapies and an anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy. It is anticipated that between 500 and 1000 patients will be screened per year for over 200 cancer-related genes for genomic alterations. The results of this test will be used to assign each patient to the trial arm that is best matched to their tumor&#8217;s genomic profile.</p><p style=" text-align: left;">&#8220;Lung-MAP represents the first of several planned large, genomically-driven treatment trials that will be conducted by NCI&#8217;s newly formed National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN),&#8221; said Jeff Abrams, M.D., Associate Director of NCI&#8217;s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. &#8220;The restructuring and consolidation of NCI&#8217;s large trial treatment program, resulting in the formation of the NCTN, is quite timely, as it now can offer an ideal platform for bringing the benefits of more precise molecular diagnostics to cancer patients in communities large and small.&#8221;</p><p style=" text-align: left;">&quot;Squamous cell lung cancer, like many other neoplasms, is increasingly recognized as consisting of a host of relatively rare genomic subsets, each of which may require treatment with a different targeted drug,&#8221; said Dr. Charles Blanke, Chair of SWOG Cancer Research. &#8220;The Lung-MAP S1400 trial models a way to efficiently study a large number of these rare squamous cell subsets under one master protocol.&quot;</p><p style=" text-align: left;">Lung-MAP aims to establish a model of clinical testing that more efficiently meets the needs of both patients and drug developers. Whereas a typical clinical trial for a targeted therapy tests each potential patient for a single biomarker and enrolls only a portion&#8212;sometimes a very small portion&#8212;of patients tested, Lung-MAP will simultaneously test patients for many biomarkers including selected base substitutions and small in/dels, gene fusions, and amplifications in order to assess compatibility with several different experimental treatments. All patients tested will then be enrolled into one of Lung-MAP&#8217;s five trial arms.</p><p style=" text-align: left;">&#8220;Traditional clinical trials have long imposed significant recruitment and infrastructure burdens on researchers and patients, with frustratingly slow results,&#8221; said Maria Freire, Ph.D.,&#160;President and Executive Director of the FNIH. &#8220;This master protocol will allow multiple enrollees to be tested once and assigned to a treatment most likely to work for them, rather than separate tests for separate trials with most patients ineligible. This strategy will validate biomarkers and facilitate drug development in one infrastructure, to more rapidly provide safer and more effective treatments to patients.&#8221;</p><p style=" text-align: left;">Lung-MAP will make it easier for patients and researchers to find one another. It will also be more flexible than traditional clinical trial models. Where typical clinical trials require the development of new protocols for each new drug tested, Lung-MAP uses a single &#8220;master protocol,&#8221; which can be amended as needed as drugs enter and exit the trial, preserving infrastructure and patient outreach efforts.</p><p style=" text-align: left;">The trial will be conducted at over 200 medical centers by NCI&#8217;s NCTN, led by SWOG, and partly funded by NCI through its Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. Significant additional funding will be provided by the participating companies as part of a partnership managed by FNIH that also involves the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Friends of Cancer Research, and other patient advocacy organizations. The trial infrastructure is capable of testing as many as five to seven additional drugs over the next 5 years, and will cost up to $160 million.</p><p style=" text-align: left;">Said Vincent Miller, M.D., Chief Medical Officer of Foundation Medicine, &#8220;Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung is a deadly cancer killer and like many common solid tumors, analysis of no one or even several genes provides a sufficiently comprehensive characterization of the actionable alterations present in a population of patients to ensure a high screen hit rate when evaluating patients for a targeted therapy approach. Rather, multiple genes often altered by one or more classes of DNA changes and often co-occurring are unpredictably altered in any given patient. The comprehensive, broad based nature of FoundationOne testing allowed us to be uniquely suited to provide reliable results across an unprecedented broad swath of predictive biomarkers in a clinically relevant turnaround time to attract multiple interested pharma partners with distinct therapeutic targets.&#8221;</p><p style=" text-align: center;">###</p><p style=" text-align: left;">Website: <a href="http://www.Lung-MAP.org">www.Lung-MAP.org</a></p><p style=" text-align: left;">ClinicalTrials.gov: <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02154490?term=1400&amp;recr=Open&amp;rank=4" target="_blank">https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02154490?term=1400&amp;recr=Open&amp;rank=4</a></p></div>]]></row>

  	</div><p>The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG), a clinical trials organization funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of NIH, and NCI are making the results public today because a long-term follow-up analysis showed significantly longer survival for those people on the trial who received chemotherapy. Full details from this analysis are to be presented at a scientific meeting in 2014 and in a peer-reviewed publication.</p><p>The study, RTOG 9802, enrolled 251 patients with low-grade gliomas between October 1998 and June 2002 to address the role of chemotherapy following radiation treatment.&#160; Patients enrolled were at high risk compared to other low-grade glioma patients because they were 40 years of age or older or had a less than complete surgical removal of their tumor if they were under 40 years of age.</p><p>All patients started treatment with surgery followed by radiation therapy. &#160;By random assignment, half of patients stopped treatment after radiation therapy and the other half received six cycles of chemotherapy after completing radiation therapy. Patients receiving chemotherapy got three drugs: procarbazine (P); CCNU (C), which generically is known as lomustine; and vincristine (V).&#160; This chemotherapy, termed PCV, was given over 21 days and repeated every eight weeks for a total of six cycles.</p><p>A significant improvement in overall survival was noted for study participants who received PCV chemotherapy plus radiation therapy (13. 3 years median survival time) compared to those receiving radiation therapy alone (7.8 years median survival time), which is a difference of 5.5 years. Median follow-up after initial enrollment has been almost 12 years.</p><p><a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>Analysis of how patients are doing based upon the molecular and genetic characteristics of their tumors is ongoing. These studies will be important since molecular characteristics of related brain tumors have been able to identify patients most likely to benefit from chemotherapy.</p><p>&#8220;The results of this study are practice-changing,&#8221; said co-lead investigator Jan Buckner, M.D., professor of oncology, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn. &#8220;Additionally, ongoing analysis of patient tumor samples should allow us to further identify the patients who will, and who will not, benefit from chemotherapy, taking yet another step toward individualized therapy.&#8221;&#160; &#160;</p><p>Edward Shaw, M.D., co-lead investigator and radiation oncologist at Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, NC, noted, &#8220;Patients who are deemed appropriate candidates for radiation therapy should be encouraged to receive chemotherapy as well, understanding both the potential benefits and risks.&#8221;</p><p>RTOG 9802 was sponsored by NCI and was designed and conducted by RTOG in collaboration with three other NCI cooperative groups (SWOG, ECOG-ACRIN, and the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology). RTOG will work as a component of a new network group, NRG Oncology, effective March 2014.</p><p>&#8220;This trial would not have been done in the United States without a large national network of investigators brought together through the NCI-supported Cooperative Group program that was capable of enrolling patients with a relatively uncommon cancer like low-grade glioma,&#8221; said Jeff Abrams, M.D., clinical director of NCI&#8217;s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. &#8220;These findings also are an example of how combining available treatments can produce a significant improvement in clinical outcome.&#8221;</p><p>It is estimated that over 23,000 people will be diagnosed with primary brain tumors in the United States in 2014 and that 10 percent to 15 percent will have low-grade gliomas.</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5541879" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="1823" sys_dependentid="701561">

Researchers at NCI found this simple measure of nicotine dependency improved lung cancer risk prediction beyond standard smoking measures, such as cigarettes per day, age, gender, history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other lung cancer risk factors. The results of this study were published online in the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute,</i> June 19, 2014.</p><p>Neil E. Caporaso, M.D., senior investigator, and Fangyi Gu, M.Med., Sc.D., postdoctoral fellow, Genetic Epidemiology Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, and their colleagues, analyzed data from about 1,800 lung cancer patients and 1,400 people without cancer from five cities in the Lombardy region in Italy. The researchers observed that people who had smoked their first cigarette within five minutes of waking up had more than three times the risk of lung cancer compared with those who waited longer than an hour before smoking their first cigarette of the day, after taking into account other smoking characteristics, age and gender. The increased risks were observed for each category of cigarette per day, as well as each category of smoking history. Assessing time to a first cigarette may help clinicians quickly assess lung cancer risk. The findings underscore the need for even light smokers to quit, because even light smokers who are, or who become dependent smokers, can be at substantial risk for developing lung cancer. The researchers plan to investigate the effect of nicotine addiction on risk for other health outcomes in future studies.</p></div>]]></row>

HIV inserts a DNA copy of its genetic information into the DNA of cells it infects and insertion sites vary in different infected cells. The site of insertion specifically marks each infected cell and if an infected cell divides, all of the descendants of that cell (called a clone) will also have the viral genetic information inserted at the same place as the parent. Based on an analysis of blood cells from five HIV-infected individuals, NCI researchers have identified more than 2,400 HIV DNA insertion sites. Analysis of these sites showed that there is extensive clonal expansion (growth) of HIV infected cells. In one patient, approximately half of the HIV-infected cells in the blood came from a single clone, and some the infected clones persisted in patients for more than 10 years. The research, by Stephen Hughes, Ph.D., director, HIV Drug Resistance Program, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, and collaborators appeared online in <i>Science</i> June 26, 2014.</p><p>The researchers also showed that, in some cases, the clonal expansion of HIV infected cells was associated with the sites at which HIV DNA is inserted into the host genome. The study results show that insertion of HIV DNA in specific regions of two genes, <i>MKL2</i> and <i>BACH2</i>, was directly involved in clonal expansion of the infected cells. These genes, and several others in which there were multiple independent HIV insertions in clonally expanded cells in patients, are known to play a role in cell growth and human cancers. These findings have important implications for designing and implementing strategies to eliminate persistent HIV infection, for the use of HIV- based vectors as tools to transfer genes into patients, and possibly for the origin of some HIV-related malignancies.</p></div>]]></row>

Grants to fund the program will be awarded early in the spring of 2014.</p><p>Despite its solid record of accomplishment, the individual components of the NCI&#8217;s previous national clinical trials program (the Cooperative Groups) had&#160;become less efficient, necessitating changes to several of its operating procedures over the past decade.&#160; A 2010 report from the Institute of Medicine (see <a href="http://iom.edu/Reports/2010/A-National-Cancer-Clinical-Trials-System-for-the-21st-Century-Reinvigorating-the-NCI-Cooperative.aspx">http://iom.edu/Reports/2010/A-National-Cancer-Clinical-Trials-System-for-the-21st-Century-Reinvigorating-the-NCI-Cooperative.aspx</a>) validated and refined the nature of the changes that needed to be undertaken.&#160; The Institute of Medicine suggested four overarching goals to guide improvement efforts:</p><ul type="disc"><li>Improving the speed and efficiency of the design, launch, and conduct of clinical trials</li><li>Making optimal use of scientific innovations</li><li>Improving selection, prioritization, support, and completion of clinical trials</li><li>Fostering expanded participation of both patients and physicians.</li></ul><p>In particular, recommendations from the Institute of Medicine and others stressed that it was important for NCI to consolidate its late-phase clinical trials program into a smaller number of groups, each with greater capabilities and appropriate incentives to promote better overall system integration and cooperation.&#160; Those recommendations led NCI to develop the new NCTN, focusing on four overarching goals that will guide the new system: integration, prioritization, efficiency, and innovation.&#160;</p><p>The NCTN features many changes that will enhance national cancer clinical trials research activities, specifically:</p><ul><li>The new system will use a single, common IT data management system (called Medidata RAVE) for all trials, facilitating participation by member sites in all studies, irrespective of the NCTN organization leading the trial.&#160; The uniformity of a single clinical trials system used by all of the members of the network will aid in the rapid development and conduct of studies as well as analysis of clinical trial findings.&#160;</li><li>The NCI Central Institutional Review Board (CIRB) will be expanded to cover studies conducted by the entire system, which should help sites open more trials.&#160; Previously, individual sites had to conduct their own ethics review.&#160; Having a single, centralized ethics review conducted by the NCI CIRB will harmonize the system, thereby lowering cost, time, and personnel needed for ethics review.&#160;</li><li>Tumor specimen banks and the informatics systems that will allow for the banks to be efficiently integrated have both been redesigned so that they can be used more efficiently in support of the development of predictive molecular tests to guide treatment decisions for patients.</li></ul><p>&#8220;The new network represents an unmatched effort to integrate and streamline the process of cancer clinical trials research,&#8221; said James Doroshow, M.D.,&#160;deputy director for clinical and translational research at NCI.&#160; &#8220;The conduct of NCI-supported trials, which are publicly funded, involves a complex system of designing, reviewing, and initiating studies.&#160; The new NCTN replaces a structure that was more than 55 years old.&#8221;&#160;</p><p>NCTN employs an inclusive process for generating studies and conducting clinical trials using broad representation from the oncology field, including academic researchers, as well as professional organizations, patients, and advocates. &#160;In particular, community-based clinical trials play an important role in expanding the implementation of research findings to encompass all phases of cancer care delivery.&#160; A new system to support clinical trials research in the community setting, the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), which will play a critical, complementary role to the NCTN, is being launched later this year and will involve both cancer treatment and cancer care delivery research.</p><p>The NCTN will focus on phase 3 trials, the gold standard for establishing new treatments.&#160;&#160;It is anticipated that grant support for the NCTN program could be in the range of $150 million&#160;per year with additional funds for central administrative support made available through other NCI support contracts and grant programs.</p><p>Following the results of peer review, four adult Network groups and one pediatric group, each with its own operations and statistical centers, will be funded.&#160; The new Network groups will be engaged in closely knit collaborations to study and evaluate new cancer treatments and advanced approaches to imaging.&#160; By comparison, the former program contained nine adult groups, each with its own administrative and statistical centers.&#160; The NCTN will also include a Canadian group in the Network as NCI has had long-standing collaborations with Canadian investigators in clinical trials.</p><p>Lead Academic Participating Site (LAPS) grants, created specifically for the NCTN, target many of NCI&#8217;s designated Cancer Centers.&#160; LAPS will provide scientific leadership in development and conduct of clinical trials in association with the adult clinical trial groups.&#160; The LAPS will receive increased funding because of higher patient enrollment costs, but must maintain a high performance standard in patient accrual. &#160;About 30 LAPS will work together with one or more of the new NCTN adult groups, expanding the reach of the network.&#160;</p><p>One important outcome of this new Network will be the ability to facilitate the conduct of trials in rare tumors where patient accrual has always been very difficult.&#160; The availability of a national network of clinical trials sites to locate and enroll patients with unusual cancers should enhance the feasibility of conducting such studies.&#160; Also, as more cancers are molecularly defined and classified into smaller subsets, the new network structure will support the molecular screening studies needed to define and locate the smaller groups of patients who might be eligible for such studies.</p><p>&#8220;NCTN investigators are better poised than ever to address the most critical clinical research questions,&#8221; said Jeff Abrams, M.D., associate director of NCI&#8217;s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program.&#160; &#8220;Employing the newly revitalized and efficient NCTN, scientists can conduct trials concentrating on specific cancers, specific populations, or particular methods, such as genetic screening of tumors, imaging, radiation, and surgery.&#8221;</p></div>]]></row>

<p>A new method for using immunotherapy to&nbsp;specifically attack tumor cells that have mutations unique to a patient's cancer has been developed by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. The researchers demonstrated that the human immune system can mount a response against mutant proteins expressed by cancers that arise in epithelial cells which can line the internal and external surfaces (such as the skin) of the body. These cells give rise to many types of common cancers, such as those that develop in the digestive tract, lung, pancreas, bladder and other areas of the body.</p>
<p>The research provides evidence that this immune response can be harnessed for therapeutic benefit in patients, according to the scientists. The study appeared May 9, 2014, in the journal Science.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our study deals with the central problem in human cancer immunotherapy, which is how to effectively attack common epithelial cancers,&rdquo; said Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Surgery Branch in NCI's Center for Cancer Research. &ldquo;The method we have developed provides a blueprint for using immunotherapy to specifically attack sporadic or driver mutations, unique to a patient's individual cancer.&rdquo;</p>

<p>All malignant tumors harbor genetic alterations, some of which may lead to the production of mutant proteins that are capable of triggering an antitumor immune response. Research led by Rosenberg and his colleagues had shown that human melanoma tumors often contain mutation-reactive immune cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs.&nbsp;The presence of these cells may help explain the effectiveness of adoptive cell therapy (ACT) and other forms of immunotherapy in the treatment of melanoma.</p>
<p>In ACT, a patient's own TILs are collected, and those with the best antitumor activity are grown in the laboratory to produce large populations that are infused into the patient. However, prior to this work it had not been clear whether the human immune system could mount an effective response against mutant proteins produced by epithelial cell cancers.&nbsp; These cells comprise more than 80 percent of all cancers. It was also not known whether such a response could be used to develop personalized immunotherapies for these cancers.</p>
<p>In this study, Rosenberg and his team set out to determine whether TILs from patients with metastatic gastrointestinal cancers could recognize patient-specific mutations. They analyzed TILs from a patient with bile duct cancer that had metastasized to the lung and liver and had not been responsive to standard chemotherapy. The patient, a 43-year-old woman, was enrolled in an NIH trial of ACT for patients with gastrointestinal cancers (Clinical trial number NCT01174121).</p>
<p>The researchers first did whole-exome sequencing, in which the protein-coding regions of DNA are analyzed to identify mutations that the patient's immune cells might recognize. Further testing showed that some of the patient's TILs recognized a mutation in a protein called ERBB2-interacting protein (ERBB2IP). The patient then underwent adoptive cell transfer of 42.4 billion TILs, approximately 25 percent of which were ERBB2IP mutation-reactive T lymphocytes, which are primarily responsible for activating other cells to aid cellular <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a> immunity, followed by treatment with four doses of the anticancer drug interleukin-2 to enhance T-cell proliferation and function.</p>
<p>Following transfer of the TILs, the patient's metastatic lung and liver tumors stabilized. When the patient's disease eventually progressed, after about 13 months, she was re-treated with ACT in which 95 percent of the transferred cells were mutation-reactive T cells, and she experienced tumor regression that was ongoing as of the last follow up (six months after the second T-cell infusion). These results provide evidence that a T-cell response against a mutant protein can be harnessed to mediate regression of a metastatic epithelial cell cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Given that a major hurdle for the success of immunotherapies for gastrointestinal and other cancers is the apparent low frequency of tumor-reactive T cells, the strategies reported here could be used to generate a T-cell adoptive cell therapy for patients with common cancers,&rdquo; said Rosenberg.</p>

In the study, published online July 23, 2014, in Nature, the scientists report that this discovery could change how researchers think about developing treatments for stomach cancer, also called gastric cancers or gastric adenocarcinomas.</p><p>Instead of considering gastric cancer as a single disease, as has been done in the past, researchers will now be able to explore therapies in defined sets of patients whose tumors have specific genomic abnormalities. Stomach cancers are a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, resulting in an estimated 723,000 deaths annually.</p><p>Previous attempts to examine the clinical characteristics of gastric cancer were hindered by how differently cancer cells can look under a microscope, even when from the same tumor. The researchers hope that the new classification system will serve as a valuable adjunct to the current pathology classification system, which has two categories: diffuse and intestinal.</p><p>&#8220;A key advance with this project is that we have identified and developed a much more useful classification system to find groups of gastric cancer that have distinct molecular features, and at the same time, we also identified key targets to pursue in different groups of patients,&#8221; said Adam Bass, M.D., Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, the Broad Institute, Boston, and one of the lead investigators on the project. &#8220;This will provide a strong foundation for categorizing the disease and for doing so in a way in which we can develop clinical trials based on some of the critical molecular alterations that are driving different classes of cancers.&#8221;</p><p>The researchers identified the new subgroups through complex statistical analyses of molecular data from 295 tumors. They used six molecular analysis platforms including DNA sequencing, RNA sequencing, and protein arrays.</p><p>Tumors in the first group, which represented 9 percent of the tumors, were positive for Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and had several other molecular commonalities. Tumors in a second subgroup (22 percent of the tumors) had high microsatellite instability (MSI), which is the tendency for mutations to accumulate in repeated sequences of DNA. The remaining subgroups differed in the level of somatic copy number alterations (SCNAs), which can result from duplication or deletion of sections of the genome. The tumors in the third subgroup, which comprised 20 percent of the tumors, were considered to have a low level of SCNAs and were called genomically stable. The remaining 50 percent of tumors were classified as chromosomally unstable, with a high level of SCNAs.</p><p>The EBV-positive subgroup of tumors was of particular interest. EBV is best known in the United States as the cause of infectious mononucleosis, which is characterized by fever, sore throat, and swollen lymph glands, especially in the neck. EBV is also suspected of causing certain cancers, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma and some types of lymphoma. Previous research had shown that EBV can be detected in a minority of gastric adenocarcinomas and that EBV genes are expressed in those tumors. However, this study found that the presence of EBV in gastric tumors is associated with a number of other molecular characteristics.</p><p>First, the researchers observed that EBV-positive tumors displayed a high frequency of mutations in the PIK3CA gene, which codes for a component of a protein, PI3-kinase, which is essential for cell growth and division and many other cellular activities that are important in cancer. Although 80 percent of EBV-positive tumors harbored a protein-changing alteration in PIK3CA, PIK3CA mutations were found in 3 percent to 42 percent of tumors of the other gastric cancer subtypes. The scientists suggested that EBV-positive tumors might respond to PI3-kinase inhibitors, some of which are in the early stages of testing in clinical trials but are not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for general use.</p><p>Some tumors in the EBV-positive subgroup also showed more gene copies being produced in a chromosomal region that contains the JAK2 gene. The JAK2 protein facilitates cell growth and division, and the increased expression of JAK2 may inappropriately activate cell growth. The amplified region also contains the genes for two proteins, PD-L1 and PD-L2, which suppress immune responses; their increased expression may help tumors escape destruction by the immune system. The investigators suggested that these findings support the evaluation of JAK2 inhibitors and PD-L1/2 antagonists for the treatment of EBV-positive gastric cancers.</p><p>And the EBV-positive subgroup showed a far higher prevalence of DNA hypermethylation than any other cancer subtype reported by TCGA researchers. Methylation is the process of adding methyl groups to DNA, which reduces gene expression. Hypermethylation occurs when this mechanism continues aberrantly, quieting genes that should be active. In the EBV-positive tumor subgroup, hypermethylation was most often observed in the promoter regions of genes, which would prevent the expression of the genes.</p><p>&quot;Gaining these insights into the connection between EBV and gastric cancer is the type of groundbreaking research that NIH is pleased to be a part of. We look forward to the potential clinical implications of this discovery,&quot; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.</p><p>&#160;&#8220;This study reinforces the value of the approach we are using to study genomic diversity and similarity among tumors of&#160;many different cancer types,&#8221; said NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. &#8220;Only such a systematic analysis could have yielded observations about the association between EBV and several provocative molecular characteristics.&#8221;</p><p>Important insights also came from analyses of the three other gastric cancer subgroups. For example, tumors of the genomically stable subtype contained frequent mutations in a gene called RHOA, whose product interacts with other cellular proteins to help cells change shape and migrate, which may be important in tumor growth. This finding suggests possible targets for treating tumors of this subtype. And tumors of the chromosomal unstable subtype contained frequent amplifications of genes that encode receptor proteins on the outside of the cell, leading to the promotion of aberrant cell growth. Drugs are already available to curb the activity of some of these proteins.</p><p>&#8220;This most recent TCGA study again demonstrates the importance of its comprehensive design,&#8221; said NHGRI Director Eric Green, M.D., Ph.D. &#8220;These results give us important new genomic insights into a cause of a deadly form of cancer.&quot;</p><p>TCGA is jointly managed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both parts of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), to comprehensively characterize the genomes of more than 30 types of cancer.

A second study (called <a href="http://ncias-p991-v:9992/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_contentid=777000&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="777000" sys_dependentvariantid="704" sys_relationshipid="5460361" sys_siteid="305" sys_variantid="704" sys_contentid="777000">POEMS</a>) showed that young women with hormone receptor-negative breast cancer (their tumors were not responsive to hormonal therapy) could receive chemotherapy treatment for their cancer without losing their fertility. These two studies make clear the importance of studying cancer in younger women. Cancers in younger age groups have been understudied and under-addressed so these studies fill in some important research gaps.</li><li>The NCI and the Breast International Group (BIG) cosponsored the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_revision=3&amp;sys_contentid=14148&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="14148" sys_dependentvariantid="704" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4540368" sys_siteid="305">ALTTO study</a> which was designed to determine whether chemotherapy plus the combination of of lapatinib and trastuzumab was better than chemotherapy with either agent alone. Although this trial yielded a negative finding for benefit of using a combination of the two drugs, the principle tested in ALTTO allowed researchers to get results sooner and with fewer patients overall than if the U.S. had conducted its own trial without this international collaboration. The greater than 90 percent overall survival rate at four years or more for women observed in this trial underscores the importance of NCI research (NCI-funded research contributed to the development of both lapatinib and trastuzumab) in turning an aggressive disease into a treatable one. In addition, molecular studies planned in ALTTO will potentially allow researchers to better understand the tumor characteristics of 550 of the 8,000 patients in the trial who relapsed. This may help scientists develop better drugs in the future.</li><li>The lessons learned from ALTTO also helped NCI and BIG to more quickly launch a large international phase III trial called OlympiA (olaparib in BRCA mutation carriers in the adjuvant treatment of early stage breast cancer). OlympiA is being conducted by the NCI-supported NRG group. OlympiA will be activated in the NCIs National Clinical Trials Network in June 2014.</li><li>In addition to the ALTTO trial, several trials presented at the ASCO annual meeting were international collaborations, including POEMS and SOFT/TEXT. Enrollment by NCI-sponsored trial groups in collaboration with other groups worldwide allowed clinicians to get important answers faster and with fewer resources. The results of the POEMS and SOFT/TEXT trials would have not been available this quickly if not for the ability to leverage global networks with U.S. cooperative groups.</li><li>The clinical trial using a novel targeted combination of cediranib and olaparib in <a href="http://ncias-p991-v:9992/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_revision=1&amp;sys_contentid=776849&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="776849" sys_dependentvariantid="704" sys_relationshipid="5460362" sys_siteid="305" sys_variantid="704" sys_contentid="776849">ovarian cancer</a>, which showed a doubling of median survival time, is based, in part, on results from a NCI-sponsored TGCA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) Research Network study. There are plans to confirm this finding in large phase 3 trials in ovarian cancer. In addition, results from TCGA have shown that there are genetic similarities between high-grade serous ovarian cancer and BRCA-type breast cancer, which supports studies of this combination in some types of breast cancer as well.</li><li>An NCI study done at the National Institutes of Health clinical center found that a novel immunotherapy approach for cervical cancer showed promise for other HPV-related cancers.

The grants are being awarded under the <a href="http://ncorp.cancer.gov">NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP)</a>, a national network of investigators, cancer care providers, academic institutions, and other organizations that provide care to diverse populations in community-based healthcare practices across the United States. The program funding is $93 million a year for 5 years.</p><p>NCORP will design and conduct trials to improve cancer prevention, cancer control, screening, and post-treatment management. The new program will have an expanded portfolio of clinical trials and other studies, including an emphasis on cancer care delivery research. Cancer care delivery research within NCORP focuses on diverse and multi-level factors (e.g. social, financing systems, process, technology, and others) that affect access to and quality of care in the community. According to Worta McCaskill-Stevens, M.D., director of NCORP, the creation of NCORP allows NCI to take advantage of recent advances in the understanding of cancer and bring this new knowledge into clinical trials conducted in the community, where most patients receive their care. The NCORP network, she explains, will identify and evaluate the critically needed interventions that reduce cancer risk and incidence, enhance cancer patients&#8217; quality of life, and increase access to clinical trials and cancer care delivery research for minority, rural, and other underserved patient populations.</p><p>The 53 awards fall into one of three categories:</p><ul type="disc"><li><a href="http://ncorp.cancer.gov/about/sites.html#research-bases">7 Research Bases</a> function as hubs for the network, designing and conducting multi-center cancer clinical trials and cancer care delivery research and providing overall administration, data management, scientific leadership, and regulatory compliance.</li><li><a href="http://ncorp.cancer.gov/about/sites.html#community-sites">34 Community Sites</a> accrue participants to clinical trials conducted by NCORP Research Bases, NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) treatment and imaging trials, quality of life studies, and cancer care delivery research involving patients, practitioners, and/or healthcare organizations.</li><li><a href="http://ncorp.cancer.gov/about/sites.html#minority-sites">12 Minority/Underserved Community Sites</a> accrue participants in the same way as the Community Sites but have a patient population comprising at least 30% racial/ethnic minorities or rural residents.</li></ul><p>NCORP replaces two previous NCI community-based clinical research programs: the <a href="http://ccop.cancer.gov/">NCI Community Clinical Oncology Program</a> (CCOP, made up of the Community Clinical Oncology Programs, Minority-Based Clinical Oncology Programs, and Research Bases) and the <a href="http://ncccp.cancer.gov/">NCI Community Cancer Centers Program (NCCCP)</a>. The new program builds on the strengths of the previous programs and aims to better address the most pressing issues affecting the conduct and delivery of care in communities across the nation. Ongoing clinical trials will be seamlessly incorporated into NCORP and continue to completion to achieve continuity of care for patients. Former CCOP sites that did not become NCORP sites will receive support to allow patients to complete their studies and receive appropriate follow up care. In addition, NCORP will align with the National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN), NCI&#8217;s nationwide program for large treatment and imaging trials. The alignment between the two programs seeks to reduce operational redundancies, streamline reporting requirements, and leverage cross-institutional data systems in order to create a more efficient clinical trials network.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>The <b>A</b>djuvant <b>L</b>ung <b>C</b>ancer Enric<b>h</b>m<b>e</b>nt <b>M</b>arker <b>I</b>dentification and <b>S</b>equencing <b>T</b>rials, or ALCHEMIST, was launched today to identify early-stage lung cancer patients with tumors that harbor certain uncommon genetic changes and evaluate whether drug treatments targeted against those changes can lead to improved survival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We believe that the findings from ALCHEMIST will not only help answer an important question about the addition of targeted therapies in earlier stage disease but will also help us in understanding the prevalence and natural history of these genomic changes in earlier stage lung cancer. We also hope to gain a better understanding as well regarding the genetic changes in the tumor at the time of recurrence,&rdquo; said Shakun Malik, M.D., head of Thoracic Cancer Therapeutics in the Clinical Investigations Branch of the National Cancer Institute (NCI). &ldquo;The findings will help to define clinical, biologic and molecular behaviors of this type of lung cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ALCHEMIST is supported by the NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, with coordination of the component trials by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology and the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. All of the NCI-supported National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) groups collaborated in the development of ALCHEMIST and are participating in the component trials.</p>
<p>People enrolled in ALCHEMIST will need to undergo surgical removal of their tumors; have been diagnosed with lung adenocarcinoma or similar types of lung cancer as identified by examining the tissue; and will need to complete standard therapy after surgery, consisting of chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy as prescribed by their physician.</p>
<p>In the ALCHEMIST screening trial, the surgically removed tissue will be tested in a central laboratory for certain genetic changes in two genes, ALK and EGFR. Participants with tumors found to harbor EGFR mutations or rearrangement of the ALK gene will then be referred to one of two randomized, placebo-controlled ALCHEMIST treatment trials. These studies will evaluate the value of adding therapy with specific agents targeted against two genetic alterations, erlotinib (EGFR) and crizotinib (ALK), in the post-operative setting. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved these drugs for the treatment of patients with advanced forms of lung cancer whose tumors harbor the targeted genetic alterations. However, it is not known if these agents will be beneficial when administered to patients who are clinically free of disease. The goal of the trials is to determine whether erlotinib or crizotinib will prevent lung cancer recurrence, as well as prolong life, when used against tumors that carry specific mutations.</p>
<p>The three component trials of ALCHEMIST are:</p>
<p>ALCHEMIST - <b><i>Screening component (A151216)</i></b> &ndash; Coordinated by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology; Principal Investigators: Pasi A. Janne, M.D., Ph.D., and Geoffrey Oxnard, M.D., Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston. <a href="/clinicaltrials/NCT02194738">http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/NCT02194738</a></p>
<p>ALCHEMIST - <b><i>EGFR Treatment component (A081105)</i></b> &ndash; Coordinated by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology; Principal Investigator: Ramaswamy Govindan, M.D., Washington University, St. Louis. <a href="/clinicaltrials/NCT02193282">http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/NCT02193282</a></p>
<p>ALCHEMIST - <b><i>ALK Treatment component (E4512)</i></b> &ndash; Coordinated by ECOG-ACRIN; Principal Investigator: David E. Gerber, M.D., University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas. <a href="/clinicaltrials/NCT02201992">http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/NCT02201992</a></p>
<p>Alterations in EGFR and ALK genes are not common. In the United States, about 10 percent of patients with lung adenocarcinoma and similar types of lung cancer will have tumors with alterations in the EGFR gene, and 5 percent will have alterations of the ALK gene. ALCHEMIST will screen about 6,000 to 8,000 potential participants at hundreds of sites across the United States over five to six years to identify those with EGFR and ALK alterations who would be eligible for the two ALCHEMIST treatment trials. The researchers expect a total enrollment of about 800 patients in those treatment trials. All screened participants, irrespective of the marker status of their tumors, will be followed for five years in the screening trial.</p>
<p>All participants in ALCHEMIST will continue to receive the best care possible for their lung cancer. At the conclusion of the treatment trials, statisticians will analyze the survival of patients who received an additional genetically-targeted drug therapy versus patients who received standard therapy alone.</p>
<p>ALCHEMIST involves substantial collaborations with biotechnology and pharmaceutical partners. For the ALCHEMIST screening component, central laboratory testing for EGFR gene mutations and for the ALK gene rearrangement will be performed by Response Genetics, Inc., Los Angeles. For the ALCHEMIST treatment trials, Pfizer, New York City, will provide crizotinib under a clinical trials agreement with the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. Astellas Pharma US, Inc., Northbrook, Illinois, will provide erlotinib under a cooperative research and development agreement with NCI for the clinical development of erlotinib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This approach highlights the ability of NCTN to efficiently screen large numbers of patients in order to identify those with early-stage EGFR mutant or ALK&nbsp;rearranged&nbsp;lung cancer,"&nbsp;said Monica Bertagnolli, M.D., Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, head of the lead network (Alliance) for ALCHEMIST. "Without this capability, it would be impossible to identify&nbsp;a sufficient&nbsp;number of patients needed to perform clinical trials to determine whether EGFR or ALK inhibitors prolong survival in early-stage lung cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>ALCHEMIST incorporates a number of other aspects of evolving clinical research and medical practice, including DNA sequencing and genomic analysis of tumor tissue, and possible additional genomic analysis at the time of lung cancer recurrence. Moreover, every participant enrolled in ALCHEMIST will also be studied for cancer risk characteristics, and their tumor tissue will be analyzed with advanced sequencing technologies in a research genomics initiative conducted by the NCI Center for Cancer Genomics (CCG). This research will capitalize on the foundation of CCG&rsquo;s earlier effort, The Cancer Genome Atlas, which is a collaboration with the National Human Genome Research Institute, another component of NIH.</p>
<p>Results from ALCHEMIST may also benefit future lung cancer patients by helping scientists to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Screen for molecular features that may predict response to a drug with a given mechanism of action</li>
<li>Analyze tumor specimens at relapse to define mechanisms of resistance</li>
<li>Develop a public database that links clinical outcomes with molecular tumor characteristics.</li>
</ul>
<p>ALCHEMIST is the second precision medicine clinical trial to launch as part of the new NCTN. The first, Lung-MAP, for patients with advanced squamous cell lung cancer, launched in June 2014.</p>

They found that the disease &#8211; chromophobe renal cell carcinoma (ChRCC) &#8211; stems in part from alterations in genes in the mitochondria, the cell&#8217;s energy supplier. They also discovered that the tumor is characterized by genetic rearrangements near a gene important in DNA repair and in maintaining telomerase, the enzyme which determines a cell&#8217;s lifespan. Finally, investigators also found that ChRCC is a distinct disease and shares few genomic characteristics with other kidney cancers.</p><p>In the study &#8211; the most extensive genomic view of ChRCC to date &#8211; investigators led by Chad Creighton, Ph.D., Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, and Kimryn Rathmell, M.D., Ph.D., University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, performed a complex array of analyses, including examining the entire genomes of 50 of the 66 ChRCC tumors studied, a high number for a rare cancer. The study revealed increased numbers of mitochondria as well as mutations in mitochondrial DNA. This led researchers to discover that ChRCC tumors favor a different energy-generating process than that used by the more common clear cell kidney cancer. In addition, their findings are the first to show specific alterations affecting the <i>TERT</i> gene that could affect cancer development, and might help explain its increased expression &#8211; and <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a>deregulation &#8211; in cancer. Overall, the findings provide new insights into the development of more common forms of kidney cancer, and shed light on the role of mitochondria and metabolic pathways in cancer. The results also support the growing realization that both the cancer&#8217;s genomic characteristics and cell of origin matter, as many cancers consist of several individual diseases that require specific therapies. TCGA is a collaboration jointly supported and managed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both parts of the National Institutes of Health. The researchers reported their results online August 21, 2014 in <i>Cancer Cell</i>.</p></div>]]></row>

Each year, more than half a million people worldwide are diagnosed with NHL, a diverse group of cancers of the immune system. Although past research suggested different subtypes of NHL may have different causes, those individual studies lacked sufficient statistical power to show this definitively. To overcome this problem, over 100 scientists from the <a href="http://epi.grants.cancer.gov/InterLymph/">International Lymphoma Epidemiology Consortium</a> pooled data from their studies to produce 13 papers published as a monograph in the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i> on August 30, 2014.</p><p>Analyses from the pooled population included 17,471 people with NHL and 23,096 without the disease.

Similarly, those illnesses that activate T-cells were more likely to elevate risk for T-cell NHLs.</li><li>Immune dysfunction was more strongly associated with peripheral T-cell lymphoma, marginal zone lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma than it was with mycosis fungoides/S&#233;zary syndrome, chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL), follicular lymphoma, and mantle cell lymphoma.</li></ul><p>These findings should provide crucial insight into the biological and clinical characteristics that drive NHL subtypes. This large-scale international interdisciplinary effort demonstrates the commitment of the investigators to share data to solve complex problems that require large sample sizes.

The study results showed cancer in the removed tissues of 2.6 percent (25 of 966) of the participants. RRSO is a surgical procedure in which a woman&#8217;s ovaries and fallopian tubes are preventively removed. The participants included women known to carry a harmful mutation in the <i>BRCA1</i> gene or the <i>BRCA2</i> gene, as well as women considered at high risk because of a strong family history of the disease. Cancer was detected in tissues from 4.6 percent of the women who carried a <i>BRCA1</i> mutation, 3.5 percent of those with a <i>BRCA2</i> mutation and 0.5 percent of women who had a family history but did not carry a <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> mutation. The researchers also found that some of these cancers arose in the fallopian tubes, a result that supports emerging evidence that many malignancies classified as ovarian cancer actually arise in the fallopian tubes. This underscores the importance of fallopian tube removal as part of risk-reducing surgery. These cancer risk estimates provide the best available information for high-risk women considering RRSO.</p><p>The study, led by Mark H. Greene, M.D., senior investigator, Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology, and colleagues from DCEG and the Division of Cancer Prevention, was published in the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i><b>,</b> September 8, 2014. The participants included asymptomatic high-risk women 30 years of age or older. Before surgery, the women provided risk factor information and underwent a blood test for ovarian cancer (CA-125 antigen) and a trans-vaginal ultrasound. (These screening tests are currently considered the standard of care for high-risk women, but not for the general population.) The investigators found that having a <i>BRCA1</i> or <i>BRCA2</i> mutation, being postmenopausal, having a high preoperative CA-125 blood level, or having an abnormal trans-vaginal ultrasound result increased the likelihood that cancer would be detected. No cancers were detected among the high-risk mutation-negative women who had normal preoperative CA-125 blood levels and trans-vaginal ultrasound results. More than half of the cancers detected via RRSO were early stage (stage 0, I or II), compared with only about 15 percent of ovarian cancers detected in the general population. Although RSSO reduces cancer risk and improves survival in mutation carriers, it causes infertility and premature menopause, which makes electing for surgery a difficult decision. These new findings may help high-risk women select the treatment plan that is best for them.</p></div>]]></row>

Study participants were from Australia, Ghana, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States and were of diverse ancestry. Fifteen of the newly identified variants were associated with increased risk of prostate cancer among men of European ancestry, seven were associated with increased risk in other populations, and one variant was associated with early-onset prostate cancer (prostate cancer in men under the age of 70). These 23 genetic variants, together with 76 prostate cancer risk variants identified in earlier studies, explain 33 percent of the familial risk of prostate cancer in populations of European ancestry. Additional studies are ongoing to explain risk in non-European populations. The study, co-led by Stephen J. Chanock, M.D., director of the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), and colleagues, appeared in <i>Nature</i> <i>Genetics</i> September 14, 2014.</p><p>It is estimated that one in seven men in the U.S. will be diagnosed with prostate cancer in his lifetime. Studies have shown that both ancestry and family history are associated with prostate cancer risk, providing strong evidence for genetic predisposition to the disease. For example, men of African ancestry are known to be at the highest risk for developing prostate cancer; men of Asian ancestry are at lowest risk for this disease. By pooling data from numerous studies of men from diverse ethnic backgrounds, the investigators were better able to detect genetic risk factors shared among these populations. This collaborative effort highlights the importance of assembling studies with ancestrally diverse populations to identify markers of disease risk, according to Chanock.</p></div>]]></row>

They found that cells from patients with Hutchinson Gilford Progeria Syndrome (HGPS), who typically do not develop cancer, contain a tumor protection mechanism that is mediated by BRD4 (Bromodomain-containing protein 4, a protein that is encoded by the <i>BRD4</i> gene). Importantly, the NCI scientists found that this tumor protection mechanism has relevance to more than just HGPS&#160;patients. Although the tumor protective role of BRD4 was greatly enhanced in HGPS patient cells, the same pathway also appears to be at work in the general population, as shown by analyses of clinical outcome data in several patient groups, including those with breast and lung cancers. The study, headed by Tom Misteli, Ph.D., head of the Cell Biology of Genomes Group in NCI&#8217;s Laboratory of Receptor Biology and Gene Expression, and colleagues, appeared online October 2, 2014, in <i>Cell Reports</i>.</p><p>The goal of this study was to uncover the mechanism for HGPS patients&#8217; remarkable resistance to cancer. First, the scientists confirmed that HGPS cells have intrinsic mechanisms that prevent them from producing tumors. They then used molecular technologies to identify proteins that mediate this resistance against cancer and with this approach they identified BRD4. The scientists next investigated whether BRD4 plays a more general tumor-protective role in the general population. Previous findings had suggested that BRD4 expression limits metastasis in breast cancer and lung cancer, and by examining clinical samples of these cancers, the researchers found that expression of BRD4-sensitive genes was associated with better patient survival in breast and lung cancer patients. In contrast, the BRD4-sensitive gene signature was associated with poor outcomes in patients with hematologic cancers, such as leukemia, which previous findings had suggested may be promoted by BRD4. It thus seems that BRD4 has different effects in different tissues and can act both as a tumor promoter and a tumor protector, depending on the tissue. Next steps will be studies to fully understand and therapeutically exploit BRD4&#8217;s tumor protective role.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>Children and young adults with chemotherapy-resistant B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) experienced high remission rates following treatment with an experimental immunotherapy. This finding, from an early-phase clinical trial, is important because children and young adults with chemotherapy-resistant leukemia who do not achieve remission have very poor outcomes. In 2014, it is estimated that there will be over 6,000 cases of this type of cancer diagnosed in the United States, with more than half occurring in children and young adults (from age 1 to age 30). Results from this ongoing clinical trial, headed by Crystal L. Mackall, M.D., chief of the Pediatric Oncology Branch in NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research, demonstrated that the immunotherapy treatment had anti-leukemia effects in patients and that the treatment was feasible and safe. The results of the findings appeared October 13, 2014, in <i>Lancet</i>.</p>
<p>Genetic engineering can be used to reprogram a patient&rsquo;s own T cells to recognize and kill any cell that carries a specific target protein on its surface. The CD19 protein, which is found on the surface of nearly all B cells (both normal and cancerous), has been shown to be an effective target using this approach. This trial demonstrates that using T cells engineered to target CD19 in treatment-resistant cases of pediatric and young adult B-cell ALL is associated with strong anti-leukemia effects. The specific approach involves collecting T cells from patients and modifying them in the laboratory so that they would recognize and attack cells with CD19 on their surface. The modified T cells are known as CD19-chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CD19-CAR T cells. Because these young patients are often in terminal stages and this disease often progresses rapidly, the investigators developed a method to harvest and grow the T cells in just 11 days. Their goal was to assess the feasibility of this treatment, determine its toxicity, and define the highest dose of modified T cells that patients could tolerate. Between July 2012 and June 2014, 21 patients (from age 1 to age 30) enrolled in the trial were infused with CD19-CAR T cells after they had received standard chemotherapy drugs (fludarabine and cyclophosphamide). Of the 21 patients, 19 received their protocol-prescribed dose of CD19-CAR T cells. A complete remission was observed in 14 of the 21 patients enrolled, and in 12 patients even highly sensitive techniques could not detect evidence for leukemia upon completion of the therapy. The most common side effect associated with this treatment was fever.</p>

However, it has been unclear whether this increase in oropharyngeal cancer incidence represents a global phenomenon. Chaturvedi and his collaborators at Ohio State University and the International Agency for Research on Cancer evaluated incidence trends for oropharyngeal and oral cavity cancers. &#160;Their analysis was based on cancer registry data from more than 180,000 patients in 23 countries. They found that oropharyngeal cancer incidence increased overall among both women and men from1983 to 2002, almost exclusively in economically developed countries. Among women, in all countries with significant increases in oropharyngeal cancer incidence, there was also an increase in incidence of both oral cancer and lung cancer, two cancers strongly associated with smoking. In contrast, among men, rising oropharyngeal cancer incidence was generally accompanied by decreases for oral cancer and lung cancer. These observations among men suggest some factor other than smoking, perhaps infection with HPV, as a potential explanation for rising oropharyngeal cancer incidence. Researchers note that prophylactic HPV vaccine has been shown to protect against oral HPV infection, suggesting an additional benefit of vaccination programs for both women and men.</p><p style=" text-align: center;"># # #</p></div>]]></row>

This multiple biopsy approach may help to detect disease early and avoid repeated biopsies for women with initial negative findings, according to a new study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute and their colleagues. Women with abnormal results on cervical cancer screening, which is usually done via scraping cells from the surface of the cervix, are referred for colposcopy and biopsy to detect cervical cancer precursors (typically classified as high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesions, or HSIL). The biopsy results determine whether excision of the lesion is required. Colposcopy with a single biopsy can fail to detect HSIL. This study involved 690 women who had up to four distinct lesions biopsied. The sensitivities for detecting HSIL increased from 60.6 percent for a single biopsy to 85.6 percent for two biopsies to 95.6 percent for three biopsies.</p><p>In the study, women 18 years or older with abnormal cervical cancer screening results were enrolled and treated at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center, Oklahoma City, between February 2009 and September 2012. The study report appeared Nov. 24, 2014, in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. Performing additional biopsies when multiple lesions are present on the cervix should become standard practice, concluded lead author Nicolas Wentzensen, M.D., Ph.D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI. Each year in the United States, about three million women are evaluated with colposcopic procedures by gynecologic experts. Often, only the worst-appearing area on the surface of the cervix is selected for biopsy.</p></div>]]></row>

The GDC will provide an interactive system for researchers to access data, with the goal of advancing the molecular diagnosis of cancer and suggest potential therapeutic targets based on genomic information. The GDC is the first step toward the development of a knowledge system for cancer, as originally recommended in a 2011 Institute of Medicine (IOM) report, &#8220;Toward Precision Medicine.&#8221; The IOM recommended a single data repository (which would be backed up in more than one location) as essential infrastructure for integrating basic biological knowledge with medical histories and health outcomes of individual patients.</p><p>The GDC will facilitate access to data generated by many existing and forthcoming NCI programs. Prime examples of current genomic data sources are TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas), which focuses on adult cancers, and TARGET (Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments), which focuses on childhood cancers. The availability of genomic data will make it possible for researchers to better classify disease. The current system, the International Classification of Diseases (ICD), established by the World Health Organization, is very useful to track disease incidence, and forms the basis for standardized diagnoses and reimbursement for care. Genomic profiling of cancer in TCGA, TARGET and other studies has shown that tumors arising from a given organ can have different molecular signatures and conversely different cancer types can share common molecular signatures. The GDC will be built out over a number of years to ensure that results of individual projects can be combined to create broadly useful and accessible datasets and will be operated with funding from NCI to the University of Chicago under a subcontract from Leidos Biomedical Research at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research. NCI&#8217;s Center for Cancer Genomics is establishing the data service with the assistance of NCI&#8217;s bioinformatics and cloud research program in the NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology.</p></div>]]></row>

The trial, SOFT (Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial), used either monthly injections of the drug triptorelin, surgical removal of both ovaries, or radiation of the ovaries as methods of ovarian suppression in women with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer. Women in the trial were randomly assigned to treatment with tamoxifen alone (the standard post-surgery hormone therapy for premenopausal women with hormone-sensitive breast cancer) for 5 years, treatment with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression for 5 years, or treatment with exemestane plus ovarian suppression for 5 years. Exemestane is a newer hormone therapy drug that inhibits aromatase, an enzyme necessary for the production of estrogen. The International Breast Cancer Study Group (IBSCG), which received support and funding from NCI, presented results of the randomized, phase III SOFT clinical trial at the 2014 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium on Dec. 11, 2014. The results were also published online in the <i>New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p><p>Researchers involved in SOFT studied the three treatments in two different groups of premenopausal women with early-stage, hormone receptor-positive breast cancer: those who had received chemotherapy post-surgery and those who had not. Chemotherapy can cause premature menopause, but only women who remained premenopausal after chemotherapy were included in the trial. Treatment with tamoxifen plus ovarian suppression reduced the relative risk of breast cancer recurrence by 22 percent in women who had received chemotherapy compared to treatment with tamoxifen alone. Treatment with exemestane plus ovarian suppression reduced the relative risk of breast cancer recurrence in chemotherapy-treated patients by 35 percent compared to treatment with tamoxifen alone. The benefit of adding ovarian suppression to tamoxifen was especially evident in women younger than age 35. Women in this age group also benefited the most from exemestane plus ovarian suppression. Among women who did not receive chemotherapy after surgery (because they had a more favorable prognosis than the women who received chemotherapy), the recurrence rate with tamoxifen alone was so low (95 percent of women remained free from breast cancer after 5 years of tamoxifen treatment) that no benefit of ovarian suppression has been seen. SOFT enrolled more than 3,000 premenopausal women with hormone receptor-positive early-stage breast cancer between December 2003 and April 2011. The women in this trial will be followed for life to assess long-term prognosis and side-effects. The trial is led by IBCSG in partnership with the Breast International Group and the North American Breast Cancer Group and is supported by NCI as well as IBSCG and the pharmaceutical firms Pfizer and Ipsen. &#160;&#160;</p></div>]]></row>

  	</div><p>&#8220;While once a relatively uncommon condition, the prevalence of class III, or extreme, obesity is on the rise. In the United States, for example, six percent of adults are now classified as extremely obese, which, for a person of average height, is more than 100 pounds over the recommended range for normal weight,&#8221; said Cari Kitahara, Ph.D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, and lead author of the study. &#8220;Prior to our study, little had been known about the risk of premature death associated with extreme obesity.&#8221;</p><p>In the study, researchers classified participants according to their body mass index (BMI), which is a measure of total body fat and is calculated by dividing a person&#8217;s weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared. BMI classifications (kilogram/meter-squared) are:</p><ul><li>Normal weight: 18.5-24.9</li><li>Overweight: 25.0- 29.9</li><li>Class I obesity: 30.0-34.9</li><li>Class II obesity: 35.0-39.9</li><li>Class III obesity: 40.0 or higher</li></ul><p>The 20 studies that were analyzed included adults from the United States, Sweden and Australia. These groups form a major part of the NCI Cohort Consortium, which is a large-scale partnership that identifies risk factors for cancer death. After excluding individuals who had ever smoked or had a history of certain diseases, the researchers evaluated the risk of premature death overall and the risk of premature death from specific causes in more than 9,500 individuals who were class III obese and 304,000 others who were classified as normal weight.</p><p>The researchers found that the risk of dying overall and from most major health causes rose continuously with increasing BMI within the class III obesity group. Statistical analyses of the pooled data indicated that the excess numbers of deaths in the class III obesity group were mostly due to heart disease, cancer and diabetes. Years of life lost ranged from 6.5 years for participants with a BMI of 40-44.9 to 13.7 years for a BMI of 55-59.9. To provide context, the researchers found that the number of years of life lost for class III obesity was equal or higher than that of current (versus never) cigarette smokers among normal-weight participants in the same study.</p><p>The accuracy of the study findings is limited by the use of mostly self-reported height and weight measurements and by the use of BMI as the sole measure of obesity. Nevertheless, the researchers noted, the results highlight the need to develop more effective interventions to combat the growing public health problem of extreme obesity.</p><p>&#8220;Given our findings, it appears that class III obesity is increasing and may soon emerge as a major cause of early death in this and other countries worldwide,&#8221; said Patricia Hartge, Sc.D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and senior author of the study.</p><p style=" text-align: center;"># # #</p><p>Reference: Kitahara CM, et al.

Patients with pediatric GIST typically are deficient in the enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), which is essential for cell metabolism and energy production. Some tumors in patients with pediatric GIST have mutations in one of the four genes that code for SDH (<i>SDHA</i>, <i>SDHB</i>, <i>SDHC</i>, and <i>SDHD</i>&#8212;collectively termed <i>SDHx</i>). However, in some patients with pediatric GIST these genes do not have mutations. Research that appeared online December 24, 2014, in <i>Science Translational Medicine</i> showed that nearly all patients in the study had what is called epimutation of the <i>SDHC</i> gene. The epimutation identified was hypermethylation of the promoter (the controlling element for gene expression) of the <i>SDHC</i> gene, which prevents <i>SDHC</i> gene expression and subsequent expression of the SDHC protein. <i>SDHC</i> epimutation was the only molecular defect found in these children&#8217;s tumors; it has not been found in other tumor types and thus appears highly specific to GIST. Knowing about the epimutation may allow physicians to connect it to unique clinical features -- for example, the epimutation may correlate with better or poorer survival.</p><p>Epimutant GIST, in contrast with <i>SDHx</i>-mutant GIST (no epimutation), does not seem to be heritable. This means that it is unlikely to signal the presence of a family cancer syndrome the way mutations in <i>SDHx</i> genes do. Most importantly, these results provide an immediate refinement of diagnoses thereby allowing clinical researchers to precisely define the tumor risk in this subset of patients and to potentially initiate clinical trials with agents which might reverse the epimutation, noted the investigators. This study was headed by Paul Meltzer, M.D., Ph.D., chief, and Keith Killian, M.D., Ph.D., staff clinician, Genetics Branch, Center for Cancer Research, NCI. The NIH Pediatric GIST clinic was an invaluable and unique resource for the study, since it brought GIST patients together, mostly children, from around the world to be seen by expert clinicians for diagnosis and treatment at the NIH Clinical Center. Due to the rarity of pediatric GIST, the researchers adapted existing genomics methods to routinely process preserved (formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded) tissue samples to maximize the number of patients that could be included in this study.</p></div>]]></row>

The image-guided approach, called MR/US fusion biopsy, combines targeted magnetic resonance (MR) imaging with transrectal ultrasound (US) to identify regions of suspected cancer to biopsy, whereas the current standard of detection, performed with ultrasound alone, involves biopsy of the entire prostate with twelve needles to remove core samples from separate areas of the organ. In this study, researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) enrolled 1,003 men between 2007 and 2014; the men underwent both targeted and standard unguided biopsies to detect the presence of prostate cancer. To be enrolled in the study, men had to have either an elevated PSA (prostate specific antigen) level or an abnormal result via a digital rectal exam, often with a history of a negative finding on a previous standard biopsy. This study appeared January 28, 2015, in <i>JAMA</i>. The researchers also compared the ability of the image-guided and standard approach to predict the presence of cancer in surgically-removed prostate glands.</p><p>The results of the study showed that targeted MR/US fusion biopsy diagnosed 30 percent more high-risk cancers than standard biopsy and 17 percent fewer low-risk cancers. In addition, targeted biopsy was more accurate than standard biopsy or both biopsy methods together at identifying intermediate to high-risk disease within the entire prostate after prostatectomy. When compared to standard biopsy, targeted biopsy was able to best guide the decision in whom to recommend for surgery. Ultimately, this study showed that targeted biopsy could identify more men with high-risk disease that were missed by the standard biopsy while reducing the detection of low risk disease. These improvements in risk stratification could translate into clinical benefits for men. According to the investigators, headed by Peter A. Pinto, M.D., NCI, the findings provide a strong rationale for conducting future clinical trials to determine if targeted biopsy reduces disease recurrence and death from prostate cancer. Cost will also be a consideration for future analyses since the greatest increase in cost was due to the MRI performed on each patient; other studies have shown that when the benefits of improved risk stratification are considered, the expected costs per patient are equal to that of standard biopsy procedures. Future studies will be needed to assess the ultimate clinical implications of targeted biopsy.&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</p></div>]]></row>

HPV is the most common sexually transmitted virus in the United States, and the number of HPV-related head and neck cancers has been growing. Almost every sexually active person will acquire HPV at some point in their lives, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p><p>The researchers also uncovered new smoking-related cancer subtypes and potential new drug targets, and found numerous genomic similarities with other cancer types. Taken together, this study&#8217;s findings may provide more detailed explanations of how HPV infection and smoking play roles in head and neck cancer risk and disease development, and offer potential novel diagnostic and treatment directions.</p><p>The study is the most comprehensive examination to date of genomic alterations in head and neck cancers. The results were published online Jan. 28, 2015 in the journal Nature. TCGA is jointly supported and managed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both parts of the National Institutes of Health.</p><p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved HPV vaccines should be able to prevent the cancers caused by HPV infection in head and neck cancers and elsewhere, including anal cancer, whose incidence has also been increasing. However, these vaccines work by preventing new infections, and the long interval between infection and cancer development make it important to understand the molecular changes that bring about these HPV-positive head and neck cancers &#8211; as well as those that lead to the HPV-negative cancers - and to develop new approaches for treating them.</p><p>&#8220;The rapid increase in HPV-related head and neck cancers, noticeably in oropharyngeal tumors, has created an even greater sense of urgency in the field,&#8221; said D. Neil Hayes, M.D., M.P.H, senior author of the study report and associate professor of medicine at the University of North Carolina (UNC) and the UNC Lineberger Cancer Center at Chapel Hill. Oropharyngeal cancer starts in the oropharynx, which is the part of the throat just behind the mouth. &#8220;We&#8217;re uncovering differences between tumors with and without HPV infection, and these new data are allowing us to rethink how we approach head and neck cancers.&#8221;<br /><br />In the study, researchers performed genomic analyses on 279 tumors &#8211; head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCC) &#8211; from untreated patients. Approximately 80 percent of tumor samples were from individuals who smoked. The majority of samples were oral cavity cancers (61 percent) and larynx cancers (26 percent).<br /><br />While only about 25 percent of head and neck cancers are linked to HPV infection, TCGA researchers confirmed that many patients with HPV-associated tumors have specific alterations of the gene FGFR3 and mutations in the PIK3CA gene, which are also found in a much broader set of mutations in smoking-related tumors. In contrast, while the EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) gene is frequently altered in HPV-negative tumors in smokers, it is rarely abnormal in HPV-positive tumors. Such insights may help in developing potential therapies and biomarkers, noted Dr. Hayes.</p><p>Head and neck cancers comprise a constellation of tumors of the mouth, throat, larynx, nasal cavity, salivary gland and elsewhere that have frequently been attributed to tobacco and alcohol use in most patients. Some 90 percent are squamous cell carcinomas, which occur in the surface layers of cells in the body. An estimated 55,000 people developed head and neck cancer in the United States in 2014. Approximately 12,000 Americans die from the diseases each year. Head and neck cancers are common worldwide, with more than 600,000 cases diagnosed each year.<br /><br />&#8220;The rising worldwide incidence of head and neck cancers makes these types of large integrated genomic analyses by TCGA vital to establish a more detailed understanding of disease causes and behavior, and for the development of new treatment approaches,&#8221; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D.</p><div inlinetype="rxvariant" sys_relationshipid="5566809" unselectable="on" rxinlineslot="105" contenteditable="false" sys_siteid="305" class="rx_ephox_inlinevariant" rxanchortext="" rxselectedtext="" sys_dependentvariantid="2090" sys_dependentid="901267">

  	</div><p>Scientists found that more than 70 percent of head and neck cancers had alterations in genes for growth factor receptors (EGFR, FGFR, IGFR, MET, ERBB2, DDR2), signaling molecules (PIK3CA, HRAS) and cell division regulation (CCND1). These genes may play roles in pathways that control cell growth and proliferation, and for which therapies are either available or in development.<br /><br />The investigators also discovered new clues about drug resistance in head and neck cancers. They found that genes affecting about 40 percent of such cancers form key parts of a pathway that helps determine cell survival and drug resistance. They showed that extra copies of the genes FADD and BIRC2, or mutations in or the absence of the CASP8 gene in smoking-related cancers &#8211; all which affect the process of programmed cell death &#8211; may underlie the resistance of cancer cells to current treatments. Similarly, the absence of the TRAF3 gene, or extra copies of a gene for the growth-promoting E2F1 protein in HPV-related cancers, may also increase resistance.<br /><br />The findings showed similarities between head and neck cancer genomes and other cancers, including squamous cell lung and cervical, indicating possible common paths of cancer development, and potential treatment opportunities. &#8220;It is surprising to see that head and neck tumor genomes are remarkably similar to cervical and squamous lung cancer genomes. They are from very different organs, but they show similar losses and gains of genetic material across tumors,&#8221; Dr. Hayes noted. These common genetic abnormalities belong to a pathway that protects cells from damage and stress.<br /><br />&#8220;These novel findings help establish a genomic map of various head and neck cancers, provide new insights into other similar cancers and &#160;may further our understanding of how viruses can impact disease,&#8221; said NHGRI Director Eric D.

By contrast, the length of telomeres in a patient&#8217;s own white blood cells, as measured before transplantation, was not associated with survival. SAA, a disease in which the bone marrow fails to produce enough blood cells, can occur at any age but is most common in young adults; in HCT, donor blood or marrow stem cells, which are cells that give rise to other blood cells, are given to patients by intravenous infusion. Telomeres are complex structures on the ends of chromosomes that help maintain chromosome integrity. They shorten naturally as people age. Telomere length has been implicated in the development of several cancers, as well as other health conditions. This study was the first to evaluate donor cell telomere length and outcomes after HCT in SAA. It appeared February 10, 2015, in <i>JAMA</i>.</p><p>Although survival of patients with SAA who have received an HCT has improved over the last decade, those who receive a transplant from an unrelated donor generally have poorer outcomes than those who receive transplants from matched sibling donors. But sibling donors are not always available. In this study, Shahinaz Gadalla, M.D., Ph.D., of NCI&#8217;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and her colleagues evaluated associations between pre-HCT white blood cell telomere length among 330 transplant recipients and their matched unrelated donors and survival after an HCT. They found that patients whose donor white blood cells had longer telomeres had better survival than those whose donor cells had shorter telomeres. The association between donor cell telomere length and patient survival remained statistically significant after adjusting for donor age and other factors important in SAA-related transplant outcomes. The results of this study suggest that donor white blood cell telomere length may have a role in long-term post-transplant survival.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>In 2010, an estimated 7,760 new cancers were diagnosed among the nearly 900,000 Americans known to be living with HIV infection. According to the first comprehensive study in the United States, approximately half of these cancers (3,920) were in excess of what would be expected if HIV-infected people had the same cancer risk as the general population. Researchers at NCI estimated national counts of cancers in HIV-infected individuals and determined that the most common excess malignancies were non-Hodgkin lymphoma (1,440 excess cases), Kaposi sarcoma (910 excess cases), anal cancer (740 excess cases), and lung cancer (440 excess cases). Infections with Epstein-Barr virus, Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (also known as human herpesvirus 8), and human papillomavirus cause non-Hodgkin lymphoma, Kaposi sarcoma, and anal cancer, respectively, whereas frequent tobacco use is largely responsible for the excess lung cancers. Immunosuppression also plays an important role in many of the excess cancers. This study, which extends findings from a 2011 study, was published online February 7, 2015, and will appear in the April 2015 edition of the <i>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</i>.</p>
<p>Hilary A. Robbins and Eric A. Engels, M.D., both of the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, and their colleagues also described subgroups of the HIV population affected by these excess cancers. Among young adults, the majority of excess cancers were cases of Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma, both of which are usually preventable by consistent use of anti-HIV therapy. Men who have sex with men experienced a majority of the excess cases of anal cancer, and injection drug users experienced a disproportionate number of excess cases of lung cancer. The large number of excess cancers documented in this study suggests that additional cancer control efforts targeted to HIV-infected people could have a substantial impact.</p>

Knowledge of these genomic changes may expand the number of possible therapeutic targets for this disease and potentially identify a greater number of patients with treatable mutations because many potent cancer drugs that target these mutations already exist.</p><p>TCGA is jointly funded and managed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both part of the National Institutes of Health. A TCGA analysis of another, less common, form of lung cancer, squamous cell carcinoma, was reported in 2012.</p><p>In this new study, published online July 9, 2014, in the journal Nature, researchers examined the genomes, RNA, and some protein from 230 lung adenocarcinoma samples. In three-quarters of the samples, the scientists ultimately identified mutations that put a cell signaling pathway known as the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway into overdrive.</p><p>&#8220;The integrated nature of TCGA analysis made these findings and their potential therapeutic implications possible,&#8221; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. &#8220;We hope this lays the groundwork for future work in precision medicine.&#8221;</p><p>Mutations affecting the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway can cause it to become stuck in the &#8220;on&#8221; state. As a result, signals that promote cancer cell proliferation and survival are produced continuously. However, some drugs currently available curb aberrant activity of this pathway and prompt therapeutic responses in patients.</p><p>&#8220;Combined with the earlier TCGA analysis of squamous lung cancers, we now have a comprehensive understanding of many of the genetic pathways that lead to cancers of the lung,&#8221; said NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. &#8220;Based on this knowledge, we can now seek better pathway inhibitors to improve patient outcomes. However, for the time being, stopping smoking or never starting remain the most reliable ways to reduce the number of deaths due to lung cancer.&#8221;</p><p>In the group&#8217;s initial scan of tumor samples, researchers identified gene mutations that would increase RTK/RAS/RAF pathway activity in 62 percent of the samples. The affected genes are oncogenes, or genes that have the potential to cause cancer when mutated or expressed at high levels. Consequently, these tumor samples were classified as oncogene-positive. &#160;</p><p>To identify additional alterations, the investigators looked at DNA copy number changes, or changes in gene number resulting from the deletion or amplification (multiplication) of sections of DNA in the genome. In doing so, they detected amplification of two oncogenes, ERBB2 and MET, which are part of the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway. Gene amplification usually leads to increased expression of the encoded protein in cells.</p><p>Now that these amplifications have been identified, clinicians may be able to treat patients whose tumors have specific gene changes with drugs currently available or under development.</p><p>&#8220;It is quite striking that we have now identified an actionable mutation in over 75 percent of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, a significant improvement from a decade ago,&#8221; said Matthew Meyerson, M.D., Ph.D., Harvard Medical School, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, The Broad Institute, and one of the lead investigators on the project.</p><p>Additional analysis identified other genes that may play important roles in lung cancer development. Mutations in one of these genes, NF1, had previously been reported in lung cancer; NF1 is a known tumor suppressor gene that regulates the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway. Mutations in NF1 also put the pathway into overdrive. Another mutated gene, RIT1, is also part of the RTK/RAS/RAF pathway, and this is the first study to associate mutation of this gene with lung cancer.</p><p>&#8220;This most recent TCGA study again demonstrates the power, depth and breadth of TCGA data,&#8221; said NHGRI Director Eric Green, M.D., Ph.D. &#8220;These results give us important new genomic insights into the development and behavior of an important form of cancer.&#8221;</p><p>In the aggregate, the several forms of lung cancer comprise the most common cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, with more than 1 million deaths annually. NCI estimates that only 17.5 percent of people diagnosed with lung cancer are still alive five years later.</p><p>Lung adenocarcinoma, the most common form of the disease in the United States, develops in tissues near the outer parts of the lungs and can spread widely. Although smoking is the main risk factor, adenocarcinoma is also the most common type of lung cancer among lifelong non-smokers and the risk of lung cancer is increased by 20 percent to 30 percent by exposure to secondhand smoke.</p><p>In addition to the two lung cancer studies, the TCGA Research Network has generated data and published analyses on a number of cancers, all of which can be found on the TCGA website, <a href="http://www.cancergenome.nih.gov">www.cancergenome.nih.gov</a>.

<p>For the first time, researchers have used national data to determine the incidence of the four major molecular subtypes of breast cancer by age, race/ethnicity, poverty level, and several other factors. These four subtypes respond differently to treatment and have different survival rates. The new data will help researchers more accurately stratify breast cancer by clinically relevant degrees of risk and potentially have an impact on breast cancer treatment. Moreover, armed with this information, women will be able to better understand the implications for their health based on their breast cancer subtype.</p>
<p>These findings, along with statistical analyses of the most common types of cancer, were reported today in <i>JNCI</i>. &ldquo;The Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2011&rdquo; showed continuing declines in cancer deaths for both men and women, for children, and for nearly all major cancer sites. The report was co-authored by experts from the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR), the American Cancer Society (ACS), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the National Cancer Institute (NCI) at the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Breast cancer subtypes have major implications for determining treatment and may hold important clues to the origins of breast cancer. There are four molecular subtypes, which can be approximated by their hormone receptor (HR) status and expression of the HER2 gene: Luminal A (HR+/HER2-), Luminal B (HR+/HER2+), HER2-enriched (HR-/HER2+), and triple negative (HR-/HER2-). These subtypes are now being recorded by cancer registries across the nation, giving statisticians the ability for the first time to comprehensively examine breast cancer rates based on clinically meaningful subtypes.</p>
<p>The new report suggests that some of the differences in rates of breast cancer incidence and mortality across racial and ethnic groups are related to differences in the incidence of different subtypes. Geographic variation in rates that the authors observed were based on multiple factors, including underlying demographic patterns, regional cultures and associated behaviors, as well as access to care.</p>
<p>The researchers found unique racial/ethnic group-specific patterns by age, poverty level, geography, and by specific tumor characteristics. Rates of HR+/HER2- breast cancer, the least aggressive subtype, were highest among non-Hispanic whites, aligning with previously reported findings. Rates of HR+/HER2- breast cancer decreased with increasing levels of poverty for every racial and ethnic group. Also consistent with prior studies, non-Hispanic blacks had higher incidence rates of the most aggressive breast cancer subtype, triple negative, than other racial/ethnic groups.</p>
<p>Non-Hispanic blacks also had the highest rates of late-stage disease and of poorly/undifferentiated pathology among all the subtypes. All of these factors are associated with lower survival and correspond with blacks having the highest rates of breast cancer deaths.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition to confirming the largely encouraging trends in cancer mortality rates for men, women, and children, this year&rsquo;s report assesses breast cancer as four molecularly defined subtypes, not as a single disease. This is a welcome step, depending on medically important information that already guides therapeutic strategies for these subtypes,&rdquo; said NCI Director Harold Varmus, M.D. &ldquo;Further, it is a harbinger of the more rigorous classification of cancers based on their molecular features that is now being aggressively pursued under the President&rsquo;s Precision Medicine Initiative. The new diagnostic categories now being defined will increasingly support our ability to prevent and treat breast and many other kinds of cancer, as well as monitor their incidence and outcomes more rigorously over time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also details trends in incidence and death rates of many major cancers and all cancers combined. Overall cancer incidence -- new cases of cancer -- continued to decrease in men, remained stable in women, and increased in children. The authors also found that there has been a relatively consistent decline in overall cancer mortality rates since the early 1990s, with&nbsp;rates from 2002 to 2011&nbsp;decreasing by about 1.8 percent per year among males and by 1.4 percent per year among females. Among children up to 19 years old, mortality rates have continued to decrease since 1975, with the exception of the period between 1998 and 2003.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The continued decline in cancer death rates among men, women, and children is encouraging, and it reflects progress we are making in cancer prevention, early detection, and treatment,&rdquo; said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D. &ldquo;However, the continuing high burden of preventable cancer, and disparities in death rates among races and ethnicities, show that we still have a long way to go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the most recent reporting period, the rate of decline in lung cancer incidence and mortality has accelerated in both men and women, most likely reflecting sustained public health efforts to decrease smoking rates. Colorectal cancer incidence and mortality among both men and women, and prostate cancer incidence and mortality in men, continue the downward trends seen in previous years.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The drop in incidence in lung and colorectal cancers shows the lifesaving impact of prevention,&rdquo; said John R Seffrin, Ph.D., American Cancer Society Chief Executive Officer. &ldquo;But we have a long way to go, not only in these two cancers but in the many other cancers where the trend has not been so positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Overall cancer incidence rates decreased by 0.5 percent per year from 2002 to 2011. Among men, incidence rates decreased an average of 1.8 percent per year from 2007 to 2011; incidence rates were stable in women from 1998 to 2011. Among children up to 19 years of age, incidence rates have increased by 0.8 percent per year over the past decade, continuing a trend dating from 1992 whose cause remains uncertain.</p>
<p>The report also noted some trends that require greater evaluation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incidence rates of thyroid and kidney cancers are increasing among both men and women. Increases in rates for new cases of thyroid and kidney cancers may be due to several factors, but no increase in mortality has been noted for these diseases.</li>
<li>Incidence and mortality rates of liver cancer are increasing among both men and women. These increases may reflect, in part, increasing rates of hepatitis C and/or behavioral risk factors, such as alcohol abuse, for which there are opportunities for intervention</li>
<li>Unlike the declines in incidence of other tobacco-related cancers, incidence rates are increasing for oral/oropharyngeal cancers overall among white men. This may be associated with increased HPV-associated oropharyngeal cancers, despite a decline in those oral cancers that are more closely associated with tobacco use.</li>
<li>Incidence and mortality rates are increasing for uterine cancer among white, black, and Asian Pacific Islander women, with the largest increase seen in black women. The cause of these increases is unknown.</li>

  	</div><p>Since 2003, women between the ages of 30 and 64 enrolled in Kaiser Permanente Northern California&#8217;s health care system have had cervical cancer screening with concurrent HPV and Pap testing (called cotesting). This group of women is the largest known in the United States with the longest history of HPV testing in routine clinical practice. In 2011, NCI researchers and their colleagues published findings on screening outcomes for about 300,000 of the women in this group. Those data were used to inform current U.S. cervical screening and management guidelines, including those of the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), which recommend Pap testing every three years (between the ages 21 to 65) or cotesting every five years (between the ages 30 to 65) for women with normal screening results.</p><p>In the new study, the researchers extended their 2011 analysis to more than 1 million women who were screened through December 31, 2012. They estimated cervical cancer risks among women who tested HPV-negative alone, Pap-negative alone, and cotest-negative. They compared risk estimates based on <a href="http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf11/cervcancer/cervcancerrs.htm">USPSTF</a> guidelines of pap testing every three years and cotesting every five years.</p><p>The researchers found that the risk of developing cervical cancer within three years following a negative HPV test result was about half of the already low risk following a negative Pap test. Cervical cancer risk within three years of a negative HPV test was similar to the risk of developing cancer within five years following a negative cotest. The researchers estimated that the following number of women would go on to develop cervical cancer after a negative test:</p><ul><li>Pap-negative: 20 per 100,000 women over three years</li><li>HPV-negative: 11 per 100,000 women over three years</li><li>Cotest-negative: 14 per 100,000 women over five years</li></ul><p>&#8220;Our results demonstrate the superior predictive value of a negative HPV test, compared with a negative Pap test. Our findings provide evidence to support the currently recommended cotesting guidelines, as well as the possibility of primary HPV testing as another alternative for cervical screening,&#8221; commented Julia Gage, Ph.D., first author of the study report and a research fellow in the Clinical Genetics Branch, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI.</p><p align="center">###</p><p>Reference: Gage JC, et al.

<p>A new study has found that people who engage in three to five times the recommended minimum level of leisure-time physical activity derive the greatest benefit in terms of mortality reduction when compared with people who do not engage in leisure-time physical activity. The <i>2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans</i>, developed by the Department of Health and Human Services’ Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee, recommend a minimum of 2.5 hours of moderate-intensity exercise per week or 1.25 hours of vigorous aerobic activity, but more activity is encouraged for additional health benefits. Before this study, experts did not know how much additional health benefit might accrue for those doing more exercise. This study confirms that much of the mortality benefit is realized by meeting the minimum recommended levels of physical activity and describes the increased mortality benefit associated with higher levels of physical activity. The study appeared online April 6, 2015, in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p>

<p>Hannah Arem, Ph.D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, and her colleagues studied data from over half a million men and women in the United States and Europe who reported on their leisure-time physical activities, which included walking for exercise, jogging/running, swimming, tennis/racquetball, bicycling, aerobics, and dance. The investigators also factored in data such as race/ethnicity, education, smoking status, history of cancer, history of heart disease, alcohol consumption, marital status, and body mass index. Their findings, which will help inform healthcare professionals, included the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Engaging in one to two times the recommended minimum level of leisure-time physical activity (i.e., 2.5 to 5 hours of moderate-intensity activity, such as walking, or 1.25 to 2.5 hours of vigorous-intensity activity, such as running) provided much of &#160;the observed longevity benefits: a 31 percent lower risk of death compared with people who did no leisure-time physical activity.</li>

<li>At three to five times the recommended minimum level of leisure-time physical activity the benefit appeared to level off at a 39 percent lower risk of death, compared with those who did no leisure-time physical activity. This level of exercise could be achieved by:

<ul>
<li>walking 7 hours per week</li>

<li>biking leisurely 5 hours per week</li>

<li>running at a 10 minute/mile pace for 2.25 hours per week</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>At 10 or more times the recommended minimum level of leisure-time physical activity there was no additional mortality benefit, but there was also no increased risk of death.</li>

Cryo-electron microscopy is an imaging technique that enables researchers to determine protein structure and structural changes without the need for crystallization, which is necessary when structures are determined using X-ray crystallography. Glutamate receptors are located primarily in the outer membrane of nerve cells, and play a vital role in nearly all aspects of nervous system development, including learning and memory. Abnormal functioning of these receptors is associated with major neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, including Alzheimer&#39;s and Parkinson&#39;s diseases, stroke, epilepsy, schizophrenia and depression. Animal and laboratory studies have also found a link to aberrant function of glutamate receptors and cancer, in particular melanoma. Glutamate receptors function as channels, or pores, to allow the entry of certain ions (charged atoms or molecules) into nerve cells. When glutamate binds to these receptors, positively charged ions such as sodium and potassium&#8212;and sometimes calcium&#8212;flow into the cell. The coordinated flow of ions across nerve cell membranes is how nerve signals are generated and propagated. Understanding how to block or stimulate the activity of glutamate receptors may one day lead to the development of therapies for these and other diseases and conditions. The study by Sriram Subramaniam, Ph.D., NCI, and Mark Mayer, Ph.D., National Institute of Child Health and Development, and their colleagues at NIH, with support from FEI, Hillsboro, Oregon, was published in <i>Nature,</i> August 3, 2014. <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack">&#160;</a></p><p>A major challenge in membrane protein structural biology is the crystallization of proteins in different structural, or conformational, states. Many membrane proteins are resistant to crystallization, and trapping them in different conformational states is a challenge because crystals often contain just one of several possible states. This is especially true for glutamate receptors, which have three major conformational states: a resting state, an active state, and a desensitized state in which glutamate is still bound to the receptor but the ion channel is closed. Even more challenging, the activation and desensitization of glutamate receptors takes place on a millisecond time scale. To better understand how structural changes in glutamate receptors modulate the flow of ions across the nerve cell membrane, the investigators used drugs to trap ionotropic glutamate receptors subtypes (AMPA and kainate) in their major conformational states and then analyzed the resulting structures using cryo-electron microscopy. They found that activation of ionotropic glutamate receptors involved a corkscrew motion of the glutamate-binding region, or domain, of the receptor. This conformational change was driven by closure of the glutamate binding site. The investigators suggest that their approach to studying glutamate receptors provides a paradigm for studies of a variety of other membrane receptors and ion channels using cryo-electron microscopy.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>A new study shows that inherited variations in a known tumor suppressor gene among children and adolescents with osteosarcoma, a cancer of the bone, are more common than previously thought. Older patients who are also susceptible to this malignancy were not found to carry mutations in the gene, known as TP53. The study, finding that the genetic susceptibility to young onset osteosarcoma is distinct from older adult onset osteosarcoma, was published online April 20, 2015, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. Lisa Mirabello, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, led the research. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p>The incidence of osteosarcoma peaks between the ages of 10 and 19. This cancer often arises in people with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a cancer predisposition syndrome that is most often caused by germline or inherited mutations in the TP53 gene. LFS results in a constellation of tumors, often occurring at very young ages. Osteosarcoma can also occur in families that are not known to have LFS. The role of inherited TP53 mutations in osteosarcoma patients not known to have LFS is not very well understood.</p>

<p>To try to gain a better understanding of the contribution of TP53 mutations in osteosarcoma, study researchers sequenced the TP53 gene in a random set of 765 osteosarcoma patients, the largest population evaluated for these<i> </i>mutations to date. For all patients, DNA was taken for sequencing from cells found in the blood or in tissue in the mouth. DNA from tumors was not available.</p>

<p>“We found a higher than expected prevalence of TP53 mutations in young patients. In particular, we observed mutations known to be associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome as well as rare and potentially highly damaging novel genetic changes,” said Dr. Mirabello. “Some of these changes were associated with risk of metastasis at diagnosis, as well as lower survival independent of the presence of metastatic disease.”</p>

<p>Among the young (less than age 30) osteosarcoma patients in the study, 3.8 percent carried an LFS-associated mutation in the TP53<i> </i>gene and 5.7 percent carried a rare TP53 variation of the gene, for a total prevalence of TP53 mutations of 9.5 percent, significantly higher than the previously reported prevalence of about 3 percent. None of the older osteosarcoma patients carried an LFS-associated mutation. &#160;</p>

<p>Because the osteosarcoma patients were identified based on prior studies, the researchers did not have information on family history of cancer. The finding that nearly 4 percent of pediatric osteosarcoma cases have a LFS-associated germline TP53 mutation is important because these individuals, and possibly their family members, may be at risk of developing other LFS-associated cancers.</p>

<p>"The findings highlight the potential importance of sequencing the germline DNA in patients with pediatric osteosarcoma,&#160;because the germline analysis might uncover new cases of Li-Fraumeni syndrome,” said Doug Lowy, M.D., acting director, NCI.&#160;</p>

<p>Testing for germline TP53 mutations is also important because individuals with LFS have a substantial risk for a second cancer. Knowing that level of risk could help clinicians offer genetic counseling and cancer screening so subsequent malignancies may be detected at an earlier stage and potentially improve patient survival. Additionally, 90 percent of osteosarcomas that develop in young people do not have germline TP53 mutations and further research is needed to understand those cases.&#160;</p>

The findings also may help improve diagnosis and treatment. Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network identified new molecular subtypes that will help clinicians determine which tumors are more aggressive and which are more likely to respond to certain treatments. Their findings confirmed that PTCs are driven primarily by mutations in one of two cancer-associated genes: <i>BRAF</i> (specifically a mutation known as <i>V600E</i>) or <i>RAS</i>. The work also detailed many differences between the two genetic types, particularly in signaling pathways that promote tumor development and growth. The researchers developed a scoring system to reflect gene expression in the two PTC types, allowing <a id="_GoBack" name="_GoBack"></a> them to characterize tumors and determine both the pathway a tumor uses to send signals and its relative aggressiveness. Where a tumor lies on a scale &#8211; called its thyroid differentiation score &#8211; can have important treatment implications because different tumor signaling properties can mean the cancer responds differently to particular therapies.</p><p>The study also showed that <i>BRAF</i>-driven tumors have a broader range of genetic complexity than previously thought, with distinct subtypes. The results suggest a need for a new classification system that more accurately reflects underlying genetic characteristics of the cancer.

<p>A new study describes prognostic factors for lung cancer spread and recurrence, as well as subsequent risk of death from the disease. NCI investigators evaluated these indicators in nearly 2,100 people in the Lombardy region of Italy who were diagnosed with lung cancer between 2002 and 2005 and who had participated in the Environment and Genetics in Lung cancer Etiology (EAGLE) study. The researchers estimated risks of metastasis and recurrence for surgically-treated (stage IA-IIIA) and non-surgically treated patients (stage IIIB-IV). Stage I lung cancer is small and localized at the site where the cancer arose, whereas stage IV disease has spread throughout the body. The investigators observed that regardless of cancer stage, grade, or type of lung cancer, patients in the study were more likely to have distant metastasis than local recurrence. The experts noted that their estimates are likely applicable to the general population. The study appeared online March 23, 2015, in <i>JNCI.&#160;</i></p>

<p>Maria Teresa Landi, M.D. Ph.D., senior investigator in the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI, and her colleagues documented other important prognostic patterns. Within one year of metastasis, over half of the patients died. Patients with surgically treated non-small cell carcinoma had an increasing risk of brain metastases with increasing tumor grade. Patients with stage IIA disease were much more likely to have a recurrence of their cancer or die than those with stage IB disease. In stage IA and IB disease, about one-third of patients had a recurrence. Among patients diagnosed with stage IIA, IIB, or IIIA, about two-thirds had a recurrence. The absolute risk of recurrence was virtually identical in adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients. These data highlight the need for more effective drug treatments overall and for specific subgroups. The reported risks at various stages of disease can be useful for designing clinical trials, whose power depends on absolute numbers of events, noted the investigators.</p>

<p>Investigators for the nationwide trial, NCI-MATCH: <b>M</b>olecular <b>A</b>nalysis for <b>T</b>herapy <b>Ch</b>oice (EAY131), announced today at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) in Chicago that the precision medicine trial will open to patient enrollment in July. The trial seeks to determine whether targeted therapies for people whose tumors have specific gene mutations will be effective regardless of their cancer type. NCI-MATCH will incorporate more than 20 different study drugs or drug combinations, each targeting a specific gene mutation, in order to match each patient in the trial with a therapy that targets a molecular abnormality in their tumor. The study was co-developed by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, part of the NCI-sponsored National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). It is being led by ECOG-ACRIN.</p>
<p>NCI-MATCH is a phase II trial with numerous small substudies (arms) for each treatment being investigated. It will open with approximately 10 substudies, moving to 20 or more within months. The study parameters for the first 10 arms are being sent to 2,400 participating sites in the NCTN for review in preparation for patient enrollment beginning in July. The exact date for the opening of patient enrollment will be decided shortly after the ASCO meeting. Additional substudies are in development and will be added over time as the trial progresses.</p>
<div class="callout-box-right"><a href="mailto:ncipressofficers@mail.nih.gov">Contact NCI Press Officers</a><br /> 301-496-6641</div>
<p>The NCI-MATCH trial has two enrollment steps. Each patient will initially enroll for screening in which samples of their tumor will be removed (biopsied). The samples will undergo DNA sequencing to detect genetic abnormalities that may be driving tumor growth and might be targeted by one of a wide range of drugs being studied. If a molecular abnormality is detected for which there is a specific substudy available, to be accepted in NCI-MATCH patients will be further evaluated to determine if they meet the specific eligibility requirements within that arm. Once enrolled, patients will be treated with the targeted drug regimen for as long as their tumor shrinks or remains stable. Overall, trial investigators plan to screen about 3,000 patients during the full course of the NCI-MATCH trial to enroll about 1,000 patients in the various treatment arms.</p>
<p>Adults 18 years of age and older with solid tumors or lymphomas that have advanced following at least one line of standard systemic therapy, or with tumors for which there is no standard treatment, will be eligible. Each arm of the trial will enroll up to 35 patients. The trial&rsquo;s design calls for at least a quarter of the 1,000-patients enrolled to involve people with rare types of cancer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;NCI-MATCH is a unique, ground-breaking trial,&rdquo; said Doug Lowy, M.D., NCI acting director. "It is the first study in oncology that incorporates all of the tenets of precision medicine. There are no other cancer clinical trials of this size and scope that truly bring the promise of targeted treatment to patients whose cancers have specific genetic abnormalities. It holds the potential to transform cancer care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since many gene mutations in tumors are infrequent or unique, screening for individual mutations is not cost-effective or efficient in clinical trials. Instead, NCI-MATCH will use advanced gene sequencing techniques to screen for many molecular abnormalities at once. Large numbers of patient tumors will need to be screened because most gene mutations occur in 10 percent or less of cancer patients. Most patients are expected to have one, or at most two, treatable mutations in their tumors. By having multiple treatments available for these genetic abnormalities in a single clinical trial, several different study drugs or drug combinations can be evaluated simultaneously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In addition to exploring very fundamental aspects of cancer biology and therapy, this trial will bring cutting-edge molecular analysis and a large portfolio of targeted therapy treatment regimens to patients being treated at oncology practices large and small,&rdquo; said ECOG-ACRIN study chair, Keith T. Flaherty, M.D., a medical oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor, Harvard Medical School, both in Boston.</p>
<p>NCI-MATCH will use a single DNA sequencing test to identify gene mutations in patients&rsquo; tumors. The NCI Molecular Characterization Laboratory at the NCI Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research in Frederick, Maryland, has developed the test which looks for 143 genes associated with cancer that can be targeted by drugs in the trial. To ensure quality control, biopsy specimens from all 3,000 screened patients will be sent to a single location for processing: the ECOG-ACRIN Central Biorepository and Pathology Facility at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. The DNA sequencing analysis will be done at one of four facilities using a standardized process. &nbsp;</p>
<p>"The use of a unique kit for specimen collection, shipment, and centralized tissue processing, assures high-quality analysis,&rdquo; said ECOG-ACRIN laboratory lead, Stanley R. Hamilton, M.D., head of pathology and laboratory medicine at the MD Anderson Cancer Center. &ldquo;The network of four molecular diagnostics labs provides capacity for large numbers of patients to be screened in the trial. Pilot testing of specimens across the four locations showed remarkable reproducibility of the molecular results&mdash;another important aspect of quality assurance in trials of this scope and scale."</p>
<p>The cancer treatment drugs being used in NCI-MATCH include both U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved drugs as well as investigational agents that are being contributed by a number of pharmaceutical companies. Most of the arms in the trial will incorporate single-agent drugs that are either commercially available or are still being tested in clinical trials. However, a few arms will contain combinations of drugs for which there are enough safety data and evidence that they might be active against a particular genetic abnormality.</p>
<p>Since NCI-MATCH is designed to explore whether drugs are effective against specific molecular abnormalities, patients who have tumors that can be treated with a drug already approved by the FDA for their molecular abnormality will not be eligible to use the same drug in NCI-MATCH. They could be considered for other drugs within NCI-MATCH if they have already received an approved therapy and have a different genetic abnormality that could be targeted with a new drug.</p>
<p>There are two main clinical endpoints in the NCI-MATCH trial. The primary endpoint is the overall response rate, which is the proportion of patients in the trial whose tumors shrink by a predefined amount over a specific time period. The secondary endpoint is 6-month progression-free survival, which is a measure of whether a patient&rsquo;s disease remains stable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For our purposes, a response rate of 5 percent or less in a molecularly-defined population will not be considered promising, whereas a response rate of 16 percent to 25 percent will be encouraging,&rdquo; said NCI study co-chair Barbara A. Conley, M.D., associate director of the NCI&rsquo;s Cancer Diagnosis Program. &ldquo;After starting treatment in NCI-MATCH, a 6-month progression-free survival of 15 percent will not be considered promising, whereas a progression-free survival at six months of 35 percent will indicate that we would want to develop that treatment further.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Enrollment in NCI-MATCH will be available across the country through NCTN sites. In addition, the trial will be available through sites nationwide that participate in the NCI Community Oncology Research Program. All of the approximately 2,400 sites that participate in the trial will use the NCI Central Institutional Review Board as the institutional review board of record. Sites will access the trial under the protocol identification EAY131 via the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit.</p>
<p>The principal investigators who will lead the substudies are situated throughout the NCTN and its participating network groups: ECOG-ACRIN, the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, NRG Oncology and SWOG. All of these investigators have expertise in molecular studies, and many are junior researchers involved with, and being mentored by, experienced senior investigators. Patient advocates were engaged in the development of the trial and will help oversee the protocol and other aspects of the study.</p>

<p>Measurement of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood can be used to detect disease recurrence in patients with a curable form of cancer known as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). In most patients, measurement of ctDNA enabled detection of microscopic disease before it could be seen on computerized tomography (CT) scans, which is the current standard for disease assessment. Monitoring for recurrence by testing blood samples may reduce the need for multiple CT scans that increase a patient’s exposure to radiation and add to health care costs. Advances in the ability to monitor for disease recurrence earlier may also improve the ability of physicians to successfully treat the disease at the time recurrence is diagnosed. This research was conducted by investigators at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and appeared April 2, 2015, in <i>Lancet Oncology</i>.</p>

<p>DLBCL is usually curable, but when treatment fails, the long-term prognosis is poor. Currently, imaging using CT or interim PET (iPET) scans is used to monitor patients during and after treatment, but is often imprecise. Repeated radiation exposure is a potential health risk and a financial burden. Because relapses of DLBCL most likely occur due to the presence of residual disease at a level below that which can be detected by imaging, a more precise measure of disease recurrence potential was sought.</p>

<p>NCI investigators, led by Wyndham Wilson, M.D., Ph.D., Center for Cancer Research, analyzed serum from 126 patients with DLBCL for the presence of ctDNA. To detect ctDNA in serum, the researchers used a quantitative method that assesses gene segments with advanced sequencing techniques. All patients received therapy involving the drugs etoposide, prednisone, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin, known as EPOCH, with or without the biologic agent rituximab, in clinical trials between May 1993 and June 2013. Serum samples were collected before treatment, during treatment, and for many years after therapy. The patients also had CT scans done at the same time as the blood testing as part of standard surveillance. They were followed for a median of 11 years after the completion of therapy.</p>

<p>Results of this study showed that, among the 107 patients who achieved complete remission, those who developed detectable ctDNA during surveillance were over 200 times more likely to have their disease progress than those who did not have detectable ctDNA. The researchers also found that measuring ctDNA enabled the detection of cancer recurrence a median of 3.5 months before clinical evidence of disease. In addition, the ctDNA test was able to predict which patients would not respond to therapy as early as their second cycle of treatment, a strategy known as interim monitoring. “Interim ctDNA is therefore a promising biomarker to identify patients at high risk of not responding to treatment for their disease,” noted Dr. Wilson.</p>

<p>DLBCL is the most common type of lymphoma, a cancer that arises in the lymphatic system, where infection-fighting cells are generated. Most people with this cancer show no signs of disease after their initial therapy, but, because of the risk of recurrence, they currently undergo imaging by CT scanning on a regular basis for up to five years after their initial disease remission. However, the disease recurs in up to 40 percent of patients and is then often incurable, particularly in those who progress early and/or have significant levels of tumor cells in their blood.</p>

<p>“Even with frequent CT imaging, administered for a median of 11 times per patient in our study, early disease detection was suboptimal. Indeed, a recent study suggested that surveillance CT scans might be no better than an up-to-date patient history and physical exams, supporting the need for more effective monitoring technologies,” said Dr. Wilson.</p>

<p>The patients in this study did not undergo iPET scanning, but the researchers noted that it would be of interest to compare interim ctDNA monitoring and iPET in future clinical studies. The researchers also suggested that for patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL, early disease detection based on ctDNA could be employed as a biomarker to test novel targeted agents with the monitoring of response at the molecular level.</p>

Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network identified molecular subtypes that should help clinicians determine which tumors are more aggressive and which are more likely to respond to certain treatments. Their findings confirmed that protein-coding mutations of the genes <i>IDH1</i>, <i>RB1</i>, <i>DDX3X</i>, and <i>NF1</i> help establish that cutaneous melanoma can be grouped into one of four subtypes: <i>BRAF</i> mutant, <i>RAS</i> mutant, <i>NF1</i> mutant, and Triple-WT (wild-type). This classification should also help researchers identify which genes would be responsive to targeted therapies and help establish biomarkers for genes and other factors that could be predictive for disease progression.</p>

<p>Specifically, the study found that for Triple-WT patients, a set of enzymes known as receptor tyrosine kinases, which include KIT, PDGFRA and KDR (VEGR2), might be responsive to a combination of drugs known as RTK inhibitors as a treatment option. &#160;TCGA analyses also suggested that prognosis of melanoma patients with metastases in their lymph nodes is influenced by the nature and quantity of the immune cells (lymphocytes) infiltrating the tumor, with higher numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes associated with longer survival; this insight could lead to further personalized therapeutic decision-making. The researchers, led by Lynda Chin, M.D., UT Austin, Jeffrey E. Gershenwald, M.D., Chang-Jium Wu, Ph.D., and Ian Watson, Ph.D., of the MD Anderson Comprehensive Cancer Center, Houston, reported their results online June 18, 2015, in <i>Cell</i>. &#160;Melanoma is one of the most common cancers in Western countries and in the United States incidence for the period 1996-2012 rose at a rate of 1.8 percent per year. &#160;Early diagnosis and surgical removal of early-stage tumors often leads to long-term survival for patients with localized disease, but the prognosis is less favorable for patients with regional metastases. TCGA is a collaboration jointly supported and managed by the National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute, both parts of the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p>Breast cancer mortality rates have been declining among women in many western countries since the 1970s. Overall, breast cancer survival rates following diagnosis have improved for all women diagnosed with local and regional (area around the tumor) disease. Women diagnosed before age 70 have experienced lower short-term (less than 5 years) death rates, even for metastatic disease. And the long-term death rates (survival beyond the first 5 years) have improved among those with local and regional disease in all age groups. Tumor size at diagnosis has shrunk since the 1980s, but new evidence shows that changes in tumor size within each stage at diagnosis explain only a small proportion of the improvement in breast cancer mortality in women under the age of 70. However, changes in tumor size account for about half of the improvements for women diagnosed with local or regional breast cancer at age 70 and older. This conclusion comes from an analysis of data from NCI’s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. The study also found that changes in estrogen receptor (ER) status explain little of the improvement after adjustment for tumor size, except for women age 70 and older within 5 years after diagnosis. Results of this study, by Mitchell H. Gail, M.D., Ph.D., and William F. Anderson, M.D., both with the NCI Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and their colleague, Ju-Hyun Park, Ph.D., Dongguk University-Seoul, appeared online July 20, 2015, in the <i>Journal of Clinical Oncology</i>.</p>

<p>The investigative team analyzed data that included: age at breast cancer diagnosis; year of diagnosis; tumor size; lymph node status (negative or positive); stage of breast cancer (localized, regional, or metastasized); and ER status (positive, negative, unknown). These data revealed the pattern of changes in survival following diagnosis, and allowed the researchers to determine the contribution of tumor size and ER status to improvements in individual survival outcomes among women with a first primary invasive breast cancer. Their analysis showed that the hazard of breast-cancer-specific death declined over the period from 1973-2010, not only in the first five years following diagnosis, but also thereafter. They found that smaller tumor size within each stage explained less than 17 percent of these positive trends, except for women over age 70. In the older women with local disease, smaller tumor size explained 49 percent of improvement; for those with regional disease it explained 38 percent of improvement. They also found that tumor size usually accounted for more of the improvement in the first five years after diagnosis than in later years, regardless of age. While treatments seem to account for much of the improvement in breast cancer survival after diagnosis, more favorable tumor biology may also have an influence on trends. Experts have established that rates of harder-to-treat estrogen receptor-negative tumors have been declining since 1990. Some of the stage-specific survival improvements may also be due to changes in diagnostic procedures over time that tend to increase the proportion of women with more favorable prognoses within each stage. Findings from this large-scale study help clarify factors associated with breast cancer survival in women of all ages, according to the investigators.</p>

<p>A pilot study evaluating identification of cancer patients who respond to treatment that is ineffective in at least 90 percent of patients found that it was indeed able to confirm a majority of proposed patients as exceptional responders based on clinical data submitted for consideration. Being able to identify which patients are actual exceptional responders is an important step in determining why these patients respond so uniquely and will hopefully provide new information about genetic or other molecular factors that could help identify means to predict benefit for patients with similar disease characteristics. The study was designed to see if clinicians nationwide could identify exceptional responder patients who also had available tumor tissue removed before an exceptional response to treatment. Exceptional responder patients are those who achieved a complete response to a treatment that would be expected to occur in 10 percent or less of patients; a partial response to therapy of greater than 6 months that would be expected in 10 percent or less of patients; or a response at least three times the duration expected at the beginning of therapy. Any tumor type or any systemic treatment in adults or children would be eligible for consideration in this study if it met these criteria.</p>

<p>Since September 2014 the study has reviewed over 80 cases based on clinical information and is collecting tissue for analysis. If a clinician believes their patient qualifies as an exceptional responder, they can submit clinical information about the case, without identifiers, to a dedicated email box. If provisionally accepted, tissue from the tumor is then sent to a central tissue repository which determines if the sample meets the trial criteria and where DNA and RNA is extracted and sent for molecular characterization. This initial feasibility assessment included cases identified as of December 2, 2014. Updated information to the end of March 2015 will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) in Philadelphia on Sunday, April 19, 2015 (‘The NCI exceptional responders initiative: Initial feasibility result’. Barbara A. Conley et al. NCI. Abstract #612). Of the over 80 cases submitted, 46 were provisionally approved and 26 cases were found not to meet the criteria for exceptional responders or were withdrawn; the others were under evaluation. Of those cases that did appear to meet the study criteria, the biopsy specimens came from 41 solid tumors and 5 blood-borne cancers. Approximately three-quarters of the patients had been treated with conventional therapy and about one-quarter had received newer, targeted drugs or combinations of targeted and conventional therapy. Ultimately, the investigators in this pilot study hope to examine samples from over three hundred verified exceptional responders.</p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute has launched a multicenter phase III clinical trial called the ANCHOR Study -- <u>A</u>nal <u>C</u>ancer <u>H</u>SIL (High-grade Squamous Intraepithelial Lesion) <u>O</u>utcomes <u>R</u>esearch Study -- to determine if treatment of HSIL in HIV-infected individuals can prevent anal cancer from developing. Anal HSIL is abnormal growth of tissue in the anal canal that is caused by infection with cancer-causing types of human papillomavirus (HPV) and is at risk for turning into anal cancer. There is no current standard of care for people with anal HSIL, whether they are HIV positive or not. The number of cases of anal cancer is increasing, particularly among people infected with HIV.&#160;The prevalence of infection with cancer-causing types of HPV, which are estimated to cause up to 95 percent of anal cancers, is much higher in the HIV-positive population than in the HIV-negative population.&#160;It is estimated that 85 percent to 95 percent of HIV-positive men who have sex with men, 76 percent to 90 percent of HIV-positive women, and 60 percent of HIV-positive heterosexual men are infected with cancer-causing types of HPV. In contrast, the prevalence of anal infection with HPV-16 and/or HPV-18, the types that cause most anal cancers in HIV-negative heterosexual men, has been reported to be about 5 percent. A large study found that anal cancer incidence is about 30-fold higher in HIV-infected people compared with people in the general population.</p>

<p>The ANCHOR study will assess whether treatment for anal HSIL is effective in reducing the subsequent development of anal cancer in HIV-infected men and women compared with active monitoring via regular exams. Several different topical and surgical treatments will be used in the study. The topical treatments include the drugs imiquimod and fluorouracil; the surgical treatments include clotting, electronic cauterization, and laser treatment. The study will also determine the safety of these treatments. The trial will be conducted in a population of HIV-positive men and women 35 years and older who are at the highest risk of anal cancer. The trial will be conducted through the NCI-supported AIDS Malignancy Consortium and will be open to sites that have practitioners certified in high-resolution anoscopy (HRA) and in anal HSIL treatment by an ANCHOR HRA Training and Certification Committee. At least 15 sites will be targeted for participation. To learn more visit <a href="http://www.anchorstudy.org">http://www.anchorstudy.org</a>.</p>

<p>A new study shows that it is possible to use an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to view, in near-atomic detail, the architecture of a metabolic enzyme bound to a drug that blocks its activity. This advance provides a new path for solving molecular structures that may revolutionize drug development, noted the researchers. &#160;</p>

<p>The protein imaged in this study was a small bacterial enzyme called beta-galactosidase; the drug to which it was bound is an inhibitor called phenylethyl-beta-D-thiogalactopyranoside (PETG), which fits into a pocket in the enzyme. Enzymes are typically proteins that act to catalyze biochemical reactions in the cell. Understanding what an enzyme looks like, both with and without a drug bound to it, allows scientists to design new drugs that can either block that enzyme's function (if the function is responsible for a disease), or enhance its activity (if lack of activity is causing a problem).</p>

<p>The study appeared online May 7, 2015, in Science Express. Sriram Subramaniam, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute’s (NCI) Center for Cancer Research, led the research. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>

<p>“This represents a new era in imaging of proteins in humans with immense implications for drug design,” said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. “This near-atomic level of imaging provides detailed information about the keys that unlock cellular processes.”</p>

<p>Drug development efforts often involve mapping contacts between small molecules and their binding sites on proteins. These mappings require the highest possible resolutions so that the shape of the protein chain can be traced and the hydrogen bonds between the protein and the small molecules it interacts with can be discerned.</p>

<p>In this study, the researchers were able to visualize beta-galactosidase at a resolution of 2.2 angstroms (or Å -- about a billionth of a meter in size), which is comparable to the level of detail that has thus far been obtained only by using X-ray crystallography. At these high resolutions, there is enough information in the structure to reliably assist drug design and development efforts.</p>

<p>To determine structures by cryo-EM, protein suspensions are flash-frozen at liquid nitrogen temperatures (-196°C to -210°C , or -320°F to -346°F) so the water around the protein molecules stays liquid-like. The suspensions are then imaged with electrons to obtain molecular images that are averaged together to discern a three-dimensional (3D) protein structure.</p>

<p>“The fact that cryo-EM technology allows us to image a relatively small protein at high resolution in a near-native environment, and knowing that the structure hasn’t been changed by crystallization, that’s a game-changer,” said Dr. Subramaniam.</p>

<p>In the study, using about 40,000 molecular images, the researchers were able to compute a 2.2 Å resolution map of the structure of beta-galactosidase bound to PETG. This map not only allowed the researchers to determine the positioning of PETG in the binding pocket but also enabled them to pick out individual ions and water molecules within the structure and to visualize in great detail the arrangement of the amino acids that make up the protein.</p>

<p>Dr. Subramaniam and colleagues have recently used cryo-EM to understand the functioning of a variety of medically important molecular machines, such as the envelope glycoproteins on HIV and glutamate receptors found in brain cells. Their new finding, however, represents the highest resolution that they or others have achieved to date for a structure determined by cryo-EM.</p>

<p>“Cryo-EM is positioned to become an even more useful tool in structural biology and cancer drug development,” said Douglas Lowy, M.D., acting director, NCI. “Even for proteins that are not amenable to crystallization, it could enable determination of their 3D structures at high resolution.”</p>

<p>Two findings from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network were recently published on papillary renal cell carcinoma and prostate cancer. &#160;See below for specifics:</p>

<h2>Improved Understanding of the Genetic Drivers of Papillary Renal Cell Carcinoma</h2>

<p>A comprehensive genomic analysis of 161 tumors from people with papillary renal cell carcinoma (PRCC) – the second most common form of kidney cancer –provided insights into the molecular basis of this cancer and may inform its classification and treatment. PRCCs are divided into two main subtypes, Type 1 and Type 2, which are traditionally defined by how the tumor tissue appears under a microscope. Findings from this genomic analysis, carried out by investigators from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, have confirmed that these subtypes are distinct diseases distinguished by certain genomic characteristics. This molecular information could be important in managing patients clinically, identifying new therapies, and designing clinical trials.</p>

<p>The researchers found that Type 1 PRCC is characterized by alterations in cell signaling involving the <i>MET</i> gene that are known to drive cancer cell growth, the growth of tumor blood vessels, and cancer metastasis or spread. <i>MET</i> gene mutations or other alterations that affect its activity were identified in 81 percent of Type 1 PRCCs examined. This finding suggests that it may be possible to treat Type 1 PRCCs with specific inhibitors of the MET cell signaling pathway, including the MET/VEGFR inhibitor foretinib, which is currently being tested in phase II clinical trials in PRCC and other cancer types. Type 2 PRCC was found to be more genomically heterogeneous. A specific characteristic, referred to as the CpG island methylation phenotype (CIMP), was found almost exclusively in Type 2 PRCC and defined a distinct Type 2 subgroup that was associated with the least favorable outcome. CIMP is marked by increased DNA methylation, which is a chemical modification of DNA that inhibits gene expression. Across all Type 2 PRCCs examined, 25 percent demonstrated decreased expression of CDKN2A, a tumor suppressor gene that helps regulate the cell cycle. Loss of CDKN2A expression was also associated with a less favorable outcome. The TCGA researchers were led by Paul Spellman, Ph.D., Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, and Marston Linehan, M.D., NCI. &#160;Their findings were published online first November 4, 2015, in the<i> New England Journal of Medicine</i>.</p>

<h2>TCGA Study Identifies Seven Distinct Subtypes of Prostate Cancer</h2>

<p>A comprehensive analysis of 333 prostate cancers identified key genetic alterations that may help improve classification and treatment of the disease. &#160;While 90 percent of prostate cancers are now identified as clinically localized tumors, once diagnosed, these cancers tend to have a heterogeneous and unpredictable course of progression, ranging from slow-growing to fatal disease. The new analysis, by investigators from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, revealed seven new molecular subtypes of prostate cancer based on known and novel genetic drivers of the disease. &#160;These subtypes may therefore have prognostic and therapeutic implications. Of the seven subtypes, four are characterized by gene fusions (in which parts of two separate genes are linked to form a hybrid gene) involving members of the ETS family of transcription factors (<i>ERG</i>, <i>ETV1</i>, <i>ETV4</i>, and <i>FLI1</i>), and the other three are defined by mutations of the <i>SPOP</i>, <i>FOXA1</i>, and <i>IDH1</i> genes. Notably, the <i>IDH1</i> mutation was identified as a driver of prostate cancers that occur at younger ages. Although most (74 percent) of the analyzed tumors could be categorized into one of the seven molecular subtypes, the remaining 26 percent of prostate tumors in this analysis could not be categorized because molecular alterations driving their growth were not identified. Prostate cancer is expected to be diagnosed in over 220,000 men in the U.S. this year and is the fourth most common tumor type worldwide.</p>

<p>Another finding from this analysis was that gene expression profiles differed based on whether the tumors were driven by gene fusions or by mutations. Within the mutation-driven tumors, the <i>SPOP</i> and <i>FOXA1</i> gene subtypes shared similar patterns of DNA methylation, a chemical modification of DNA that inhibits gene expression; somatic copy-number alteration, or change in the number of copies of a gene in a cell; and messenger RNA expression, which is a measure of gene activity. These genomic commonalities suggest that mutations in <i>SPOP</i> and <i>FOXA1</i> genes cause similar disruptions in the cell to bring about cancer. Additionally, the <i>SPOP</i> and <i>FOXA1</i> subtypes showed the highest levels of androgen receptor-mediated gene expression, suggesting potential preventive and therapeutic possibilities targeting androgens, which are male sex hormones that can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer. &#160;The researchers, led by Chris Sander, Ph.D., Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York, published their results online November 5, 2015, in <i>Cell</i>.

The report, <i><a href="http://cancercontrol.cancer.gov/brp/tcrb/global-perspective/index.html">Smokeless Tobacco and Public Health: A Global Perspective</a></i>, is being released today by the CDC and the National Cancer Institute at the National Conference on Smoking or Health in Mumbai, India. Thirty-two leading experts from around the world contributed to the report.</p><p>The serious health effects of smokeless tobacco have been documented. As the report explains, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that smokeless tobacco causes oral cancer, esophageal cancer, and pancreatic cancer in humans. More than 30 carcinogens have been identified in smokeless tobacco products. Smokeless tobacco use also causes adverse oral health outcomes, including oral mucosal lesions, leukoplakia, and periodontal disease. Additionally, smokeless tobacco products contain nicotine, and users of these products demonstrate signs of dependence similar to those of cigarette smokers, including tolerance with repeated use and symptoms of withdrawal upon cessation of use.</p><p>In addition to detailing the serious and well-documented health effects of smokeless tobacco products, the report also examines the distinct challenges and policy solutions in reducing the burden of smokeless tobacco use. For example, a wide range of smokeless tobacco products with different characteristics are in use around the world, yet limited data are available detailing the contents of these products, how they&#8217;re used, and their prevalence within different population groups. Additionally, the ways in which smokeless tobacco products are produced, sold, used, and regulated differ widely across counties and regions.</p><p>&#8220;Making smokeless tobacco prevention and control a top priority in South Asia is critical to saving lives from tobacco-related death and disease,&#8221; said Samira Asma, D.D.S., M.P.H., chief of the Global Tobacco Control Branch in CDC&#8217;s Office on Smoking and Health. &#8220;Urgent action is needed in countries where smokeless tobacco use is most prevalent. Reduction of smokeless tobacco use should be an integral component of national tobacco prevention and control strategies.&#8221;</p><p>The report finds the majority of smokeless tobacco users (89 percent) are in Southeast Asia, which also has the highest oral cancer rates in the world. Users in India and Bangladesh make up 80 percent of total smokeless tobacco users in the world. Prevalence among men is high across most of the region, varying between 25 percent and 51percent in five countries. However, use by adult women is similar to or greater than use by men in some low-and middle-income countries. Among youth aged 13 to 15 years, prevalence is also high across the region, equivalent to that of cigarettes.</p><p>&#8220;While the adverse health effects of smokeless tobacco use are well documented, expanded research and surveillance efforts are critically needed to support effective action to reduce the burden of smokeless tobacco worldwide,&#8221; said Mark Parascandola, Ph.D., M.P.H., epidemiologist in the Tobacco Control Research Branch at the National Cancer Institute.</p><p>In countries with the highest prevalence of smokeless tobacco use, smokeless tobacco prices are lower, warning labels are weaker, surveillance is less developed, fewer evidence-based cessation interventions are available, and fewer resources are devoted to prevention and control programs, when compared with cigarettes and other smoked tobacco products. Developing and implementing effective strategies will require increased public health capacity, particularly in low- and middle-income countries where the smokeless tobacco burden is high.</p><p>Use of smokeless tobacco can lead to nicotine addiction, which can make cessation more difficult. In addition to causing cancer, smokeless tobacco products cause adverse reproductive and developmental effects, including stillbirth, preterm birth, and low birth weight. Some, but not all, smokeless tobacco products are associated with increased risk of fatal ischemic heart disease, type 2 diabetes, and fatal stroke.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>The Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer (1975-2012) shows that death rates continued to decline for all cancers combined, as well as for most cancer sites for men and women of all major racial and ethnic populations. The overall cancer death rates for both sexes combined decreased by 1.5 percent per year from 2003 to 2012. Incidence rates&mdash;new cancer cases that are diagnosed per 100,000 people in the U.S.&mdash;decreased among men and remained stable for women between 2003 and 2012.</p>
<p>The ongoing drop in cancer incidence in most racial and ethnic groups is due, in large part, to progress in prevention and early detection. Fewer deaths from cancer in those same groups may also reflect better treatments. Tobacco control efforts have contributed to lower rates of lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer death in both men and women, as well as many other types of cancer.</p>
<p>The report also examines trends in liver cancer. In contrast to the trends for most other cancers among both men and women, death rates due to liver cancer have increased the most compared with all cancer sites, and liver cancer incidence rates have also increased sharply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The latest data show many cancer prevention programs are working and saving lives,&rdquo; said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D. &ldquo;But the growing burden of liver cancer is troublesome. We need to do more work promoting hepatitis testing, treatment, and vaccination.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Key findings on liver cancer:</p>
<ul>
<li>From 2008 to 2012, liver cancer incidence increased an average of 2.3 percent per year overall, and the liver cancer-related death rate increased by an average of 2.8 percent per year among men and 3.4 percent per year among women.</li>
<li>In all racial and ethnic populations, about twice as many men as women were diagnosed with liver cancer.</li>
<li>Between 2008 and 2012, liver cancer incidence rates were highest among non-Hispanic American Indian/Alaska Native men followed by non-Hispanic Asian/Pacific Islander men.</li>
<li>Hepatitis C and liver cancer-associated death rates were highest among those born in 1945-1965; these also represent the majority of Americans with hepatitis C infection.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Research over the past decades has led to the development of several vaccines that, given at the appropriate ages, can reduce the risk of some cancers, including liver cancer,&rdquo; said Douglas Lowy, M.D., acting director of the National Cancer Institute. &ldquo;Determining which cancers can be effectively prevented by vaccines and other methods is one of our top priorities at NCI and one which we believe will truly make a difference in cancer incidence and mortality trends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The authors noted that, in the United States, a major contributing factor to liver cancer is hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. A little more than 20 percent of the most common liver cancers are attributed to HCV infection. Compared with other adults, people born during 1945-1965 have a six times greater risk of HCV infection. CDC recommends all people born during 1945-1965 receive a one-time test for HCV.&nbsp; Diagnosis of HCV, followed by treatment, can greatly reduce the risk of liver cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have the knowledge and tools available to slow the epidemic of liver cancer in the U.S., including testing and treatment for HCV, hepatitis B vaccination, and lowering obesity rates,&rdquo; said Otis W. Brawley, M.D., chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. &ldquo;We hope that this report will help focus needed attention and resources on liver cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection also increases the risk for liver cancer. HBV is a common risk factor for liver cancer for Asian/Pacific Islander populations, especially among Asians not born in the United States, and CDC recommends universal HBV testing for this population. Fortunately, rates of HBV infection are declining worldwide due to increases in hepatitis B vaccination of children beginning at birth.</p>
<p>Obesity and type 2 diabetes can cause cirrhosis, or scarring of the liver, which can progress to liver cancer and is associated with excessive alcohol use; from 8 to 16 percent of liver cancer deaths are attributed to excessive alcohol use.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Collecting and analyzing high-quality cancer surveillance data is essential for tracking the benefits of screening and other prevention efforts,&rdquo; said Betsy Kohler, executive director, North American Association of Central Cancer Registries. &ldquo;Data from an estimated 97 percent of all newly diagnosed cancer cases in the US are used in this report.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Report to the Nation is released each year in a collaborative effort by the American Cancer Society, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Cancer Institute, and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries.</p>

<p>Results of a combined analysis of data from two independent trials of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine strengthen previous findings from one of the trials that young women who received three, two, or one dose of the HPV 16/18 AS04-adjuvanted vaccine (Cervarix®) were equally protected against infection with the HPV types included in the vaccine four years after vaccination. The two trials whose data were pooled for this study were the National Cancer Institute (NCI)-sponsored Costa Rica Vaccine Trial (CVT) and the GSK Biologicals SA-sponsored PApilloma TRIal against Cancer In young Adults (PATRICIA) trial. In the trials, participants were randomly assigned to receive three doses of the HPV 16/18 vaccine or a control vaccine. However, some received fewer doses. For this analysis, the investigators first separately demonstrated similar efficacy regardless of the number of doses received. They then confirmed this finding in a subgroup of women with no sign of HPV infection either prior to or at the time of first vaccination (and thus representative of girls in the recommended age range for the vaccine). The pooled findings included 611 participants who received two doses and 292 who received just one dose. Further, the researchers observed that participants who received two doses six months apart showed evidence of partial protection against other HPV types not included in the vaccine formulation; experts refer to this as cross-protection. But women who received one dose, or who received two doses just one month apart, showed no evidence of cross-protection. According to current U.S. guidelines, the HPV vaccines should be given in three doses over a six-month period. These new data on Cervarix challenge the number of doses truly needed to confer protection and suggest the need for randomized clinical trials to directly evaluate the efficacy of a single dose, according to the authors. &#160;Because of differences in their formulations, it is not known whether these findings extend to the two other approved HPV vaccines. The study was a collaborative effort by Aimée R. Kreimer, Ph.D., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, NCI; Frank Struyf, GSK Vaccines; Cosette Wheeler, University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center; and colleagues and appeared June 10, 2015, in <i>Lancet Oncology</i>.</p>

<p>HPV 16 causes more than 60 percent of cervical cancers, and HPV 18 causes an additional 15 percent of cases. The remaining 25 percent of cervical cancers are caused by more than 10 other carcinogenic HPV types, including types 31, 33, and 45. With a single-dose regimen of Cervarix, researchers expect that women receive full protection against HPV types 16 and 18, but not other types. Despite the lack of cross-protection, a single dose may be sufficient to vastly reduce the number of cervical cancers worldwide, and could help to overcome barriers of cost and infrastructure currently prohibiting vaccine uptake in many regions of the world, according to the experts. In addition, future studies will need to determine the duration of protection afforded by fewer doses, noted Kreimer. &#160;&#160;</p>

<p>A new study has found that drinking water from private wells, particularly dug wells established during the first half of the 20th century, may have contributed to the elevated risk of bladder cancer that has been observed in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont for over 50 years. Other risk factors for bladder cancer, such as smoking and occupational exposures, did not explain the excess risk in this region. The study, by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth, Hanover, New Hampshire; the departments of health for Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont; and the U.S. Geological Survey, appeared May 2, 2016, in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute.</p>
<p>Bladder cancer mortality rates have been elevated in northern New England for over half a century. The incidence of bladder cancer in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont has been about 20 percent higher than that in the United States overall. Rates are elevated among both men and women. A unique feature of this region is the high proportion of the population using private wells for their drinking water, which are not maintained by municipalities and are not subject to federal regulations. These wells may contain arsenic, generally at low to moderate levels. Previous studies have shown that consumption of water containing high concentrations of arsenic increases the risk of bladder cancer.</p>
<p>There are two possible sources of arsenic in the well water in northern New England. Arsenic can occur naturally, releasing from rock deep in the earth, and arsenic-based pesticides that were used extensively on crops such as blueberries, apples, and potatoes in the 1920s through the 1950s.</p>
<p>"Arsenic is an established cause of bladder cancer, largely based on observations from earlier studies in highly exposed populations," said Debra Silverman, Sc.D., chief of the Occupational and Environmental Epidemiology Branch, NCI, and senior author on the study. "However, emerging evidence suggests that low to moderate levels of exposure may also increase risk."</p>
<p>To explore the reasons for the higher rates of bladder cancer in northern New England, the researchers conducted a large study in Maine, New Hampshire, and Vermont. They compared 1,213 people newly diagnosed with bladder cancer with 1,418 people without bladder cancer who lived in the same geographic areas as those who developed the disease. The researchers obtained information on known and suspected bladder cancer risk factors, including smoking, occupation, ancestry, use of wood-burning stoves, and consumption of various foods.</p>
<p>"Although smoking and employment in high-risk occupations both showed their expected associations with bladder cancer risk in this population, they were similar to those found in other populations," said Silverman. "This suggests that neither risk factor explains the excess occurrence of bladder cancer in northern New England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Researchers estimated the total amount of arsenic each person had ingested through drinking water based on current levels and historical information. They found that increasing cumulative exposure was associated with an increasing risk of bladder cancer. When investigators focused on participants who had used private wells, they saw that people who drank the most water had almost twice the risk of those who drank the least. This association was stronger if dug wells had been used. Dug wells are shallow, less than 50 feet deep, and potentially susceptible to contamination from manmade sources. Most of the dug well use occurred a long time ago, during an era when arsenic concentrations in private well water were largely unknown. However, the risk was substantially higher if the dug well use began before 1960 (when application of arsenic-based pesticides was commonplace in this region) than if dug well use started later.</p>
<p>The major limitation of the study was the inability to precisely measure arsenic exposure in the water consumed by people over their entire lifetime, which made it challenging to accurately quantify the contribution of arsenic exposure to the excess risk of bladder cancer. In particular, there were no known measurement data on arsenic levels in well water in the region prior to the 1960s, when arsenic-based pesticides were in widespread use.</p>
<p>The likelihood of exposure to arsenic from dug wells has diminished in recent years because arsenic-based pesticides are no longer used. Also, dug well use is much less common now than in the past. However, possible current exposure to arsenic in drinking water through use of private wells drilled deeply into fractured bedrock is a potential public health concern. For reference, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has established 10 micrograms per liter as the regulatory standard for arsenic in drinking water supplied by municipalities.</p>
<p>"There are effective interventions to lower arsenic concentrations in water," said Silverman. "New England has active public health education campaigns instructing residents to test their water supply and to install and maintain filters if levels are above the EPA threshold. But we should emphasize that smoking remains the most common and strongest risk factor for bladder cancer, and therefore smoking cessation is the best method for reducing bladder cancer risk."</p>

<p>Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), the highest grade and most-aggressive form of glioma, a type of human brain tumor, was the first cancer type to be systematically analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas Research (TCGA) Network, led by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute, both parts of the National Institutes of Health. &nbsp;Initial results of this analysis, including the identification of significantly mutated genes, were reported in 2008. &nbsp;In 2013, TCGA&rsquo;s analysis of GBM was expanded to identify several additional significantly mutated genes. &nbsp;In a new study, which appeared June 10, 2015, in the New England Journal of Medicine, TCGA researchers analyzed nearly 300 cases of diffuse low- and intermediate-grade gliomas, which together comprise lower-grade gliomas (LGG). &nbsp;LGGs occur mainly in adults and include astrocytomas, oligodendrogliomas and oligoastrocytomas. &nbsp;&nbsp;Due to their highly invasive and diffuse nature, complete surgical removal is nearly impossible, and the residual tumor can result in spread of the cancer or disease progression, but at differing rates. &nbsp;Unlike GBMs, these tumors have highly variable clinical behaviors, with a subset of LGGs progressing to GBMs within months, whereas others remain stable for years. &nbsp;Although these clinical differences are not easily predicted by how the tumor cells appear under a microscope, the potential relationship between the molecular features of these tumors and their clinical behavior has not been explored comprehensively.</p>
<p>In LGGs, TCGA researchers found recurrent mutations and chromosomal copy number changes that were associated with clinical outcome. The researchers honed in on a specific chromosomal abnormality called 1p19q co-deletion, which is characterized by the simultaneous deletion of the short arm of chromosome 1 and the long arm of chromosome 19. &nbsp;This abnormality has been linked to a more favorable clinical outcome. &nbsp;Tumors that had 1p19q co-deletion also frequently had mutation of the <i>IDH1</i> and<i> IDH2</i> genes, and this combination was associated with the most favorable clinical outcomes. The large majority of patients without <i>IDH</i> mutations showed strikingly similar genomic aberrations to GBM and had a similarly inferior outcome. &nbsp;These findings suggest that this subtype of LGGs may be the precursor to some GBMs. &nbsp;Current research is aimed at developing drugs to inhibit mutant forms of the IDH1 and IDH2 proteins, which might provide benefit to patients with the less-aggressive molecular subtype of LGG. Conversely, because LGGs without IDH mutations are similar to GBMs both molecularly and clinically, patients with such tumors may benefit from treatment protocols being used for GBM patients. According to Daniel J. Brat, M.D., Ph.D., Emory University Hospital, Atlanta, corresponding author of the LGG study, this research should help redefine relevant classification of LGGs to incorporate molecular data with the pathologic diagnosis so that patients can receive the most optimal therapy available. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>A new study of the relationship between physical activity and cancer has shown that greater levels of leisure-time physical activity were associated with a lower risk of developing 13 different types of cancer. The risk of developing seven cancer types was 20 percent (or more) lower among the most active participants (90<sup>th</sup> percentile of activity) as compared with the least active participants (10<sup>th</sup> percentile of activity). These findings, from researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and the American Cancer Society, confirm and extend the evidence for a benefit of physical activity on cancer risk and support its role as a key component of population-wide cancer prevention and control efforts. The study, by Steven C. Moore, Ph.D., NCI, and colleagues, appeared May 16, 2016, in <i>JAMA Internal Medicine</i>.</p>
<p>Hundreds of previous studies have examined associations between physical activity and cancer risk and shown reduced risks for colon, breast, and endometrial cancers; however, results have been inconclusive for most cancer types due to small numbers of participants in the studies. This new study pooled data on 1.44 million people, ages 19 to 98, from the United States and Europe, and was able to examine a broad range of cancers, including rare malignancies. Participants were followed for a median of 11 years during which 187,000 new cases of cancer occurred.</p>
<p>The investigators confirmed that leisure-time physical activity, as assessed by self-reported surveys, was associated with a lower risk of colon, breast, and endometrial cancers. They also determined that leisure-time physical activity was associated with a lower risk of 10 additional cancers, with the greatest risk reductions for esophageal adenocarcinoma, liver cancer, cancer of the gastric cardia, kidney cancer, and myeloid leukemia. Myeloma and cancers of the head and neck, rectum, and bladder also showed reduced risks that were significant, but not as strong. Risk was reduced for lung cancer, but only for current and former smokers; the reasons for this are still being studied.</p>
<p>"Leisure-time physical activity is known to reduce risks of heart disease and risk of death from all causes, and our study demonstrates that it is also associated with lower risks of many types of cancer," said Moore. "Furthermore, our results support that these associations are broadly generalizable to different populations, including people who are overweight or obese, or those with a history of smoking. Health care professionals counseling inactive adults should promote physical activity as a component of a healthy lifestyle and cancer prevention."</p>
<p>Leisure-time physical activity is defined as exercise done at one&rsquo;s own discretion, often to improve or maintain fitness or health. Examples include walking, running, swimming, and other moderate to vigorous intensity activities. The median level of activity in the study was about 150 minutes of moderate-intensity activity per week, which is comparable to the current recommended minimum level of physical activity for the U.S. population.</p>
<p>There are a number of mechanisms through which physical activity could affect cancer risk. It has been hypothesized that cancer growth could be initiated or abetted by three metabolic pathways that are also affected by exercise: sex steroids (estrogens and androgens); insulin and insulin-like growth factors; and proteins involved with both insulin metabolism and inflammation. Additionally, several non-hormonal mechanisms have been hypothesized to link physical activity to cancer risk, including inflammation, immune function, oxidative stress, and, for colon cancer, a reduction in time that it takes for waste to pass through the gastrointestinal tract.</p>
<p>Most associations between physical activity and lower cancer risk changed little when adjusted for body mass index, suggesting that physical activity acts through mechanisms other than lowering body weight to reduce cancer risk. Associations between physical activity and cancer were also similar in subgroups of normal weight and overweight participants, and in current smokers or people who never smoked.</p>
<p>The study was a large-scale effort of the Physical Activity Collaboration of NCI&rsquo;s Cohort Consortium, which was formed to estimate physical activity and disease associations using pooled prospective data and a standardized analytical approach.</p>
<p>"For years, we've had substantial evidence supporting a role for physical activity in three leading cancers: colon, breast, and endometrial cancers, which together account for nearly one in four cancers in the United States," said Alpa V. Patel, Ph.D., a co-author from the American Cancer Society. "This study linking physical activity to 10 additional cancers shows its impact may be even more relevant, and that physical activity has far reaching value for cancer prevention."</p>

<p>Scientists using a technology called cryo-EM (cryo-electron microscopy) have broken through a technological barrier in visualizing proteins with an approach that may have an impact on drug discovery and development. They were able to capture images of glutamate dehydrogenase, an enzyme found in cells, at a resolution of 1.8 angstroms, a level of detail at which the structure of the central parts of the enzyme could be visualized in atomic detail. The scientists from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and their colleagues also reported achieving another major milestone, by showing that the shapes of cancer target proteins too small to be considered within the reach of current cryo-EM capabilities can now be determined at high resolution.</p>
<p>The research team was led by NCI&rsquo;s Sriram Subramaniam, Ph.D., with contributions from scientists at the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), also part of NIH. The findings appeared online May 26, 2016, in <em>Cell</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These advances demonstrate a real-life scenario in which drug developers now could potentially use cryo-EM to tweak drugs by actually observing the effects of varying drug structure&mdash; much like an explorer mapping the shoreline to find the best place to dock a boat &mdash; and alter its activity for a therapeutic effect,&rdquo; said Doug Lowy, M.D., acting director, NCI.</p>
<p>Both discoveries have the potential to have an impact on drug discovery and development. Cryo-EM imaging enables analysis of structures of target proteins bound to drug candidates without first needing a step to coax the proteins to form ordered arrays. These arrays were needed for the traditional method of structure determination using X-ray crystallography, a powerful technique that has served researchers well for more than a half century. However, not all proteins can be crystallized easily, and those that do crystallize may not display the same shape that is present in their natural environment, either since the protein shape can be modified by crystallization additives or by the contacts that form between neighboring proteins within the crystal lattice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is exciting to be able to use cryo-EM to visualize structures of complexes of potential drug candidates at such a high level of detail,&rdquo; said Subramaniam. &ldquo;The fact that we can obtain structures of small cancer target proteins bound to drug candidates without needing to form 3D crystals could revolutionize and accelerate the drug discovery process.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Two of the small proteins the researchers imaged in this new study, isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH1) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), are active targets for cancer drug development. Mutations in the genes that code for these proteins are common in several types of cancer. Thus, imaging the surfaces of these proteins in detail can help scientists identify molecules that will bind to them and aid in turning the protein activity off.</p>
<p>In publications in the journal <em>Science</em> last year and this year, Subramaniam and his team reported resolutions of 2.2 angstroms and 2.3 angstroms in cryo-EM with larger proteins, including a complex of a cancer target protein with a small molecule inhibitor. Of note, the journal <em>Nature Methods</em> deemed cryo-EM as the "Method of the Year" in January 2016. &ldquo;<a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_contentid=1034470&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" sys_dependentvariantid="704" sys_dependentid="1034470" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="6304594">Our earlier work showed what was technically possible</a>,&rdquo; Subramaniam said. &ldquo;This latest advance is a delivery of that promise for small cancer target proteins.&rdquo; For more information on cryo-EM, go to <a href="http://electron.nci.nih.gov">electron.nci.nih.gov</a>.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/">Genomic Data Commons</a> (GDC), a unified data system that promotes sharing of genomic and clinical data between researchers, launched today with a visit from Vice President Joe Biden to the operations center at the University of Chicago. An initiative of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), the GDC will be a core component of the National Cancer Moonshot and the President&rsquo;s Precision Medicine Initiative (PMI), and benefits from $70 million allocated to NCI to lead efforts in cancer genomics as part of PMI for Oncology. The GDC will centralize, standardize and make accessible data from large-scale NCI programs such as <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)</a> and its pediatric equivalent, <a href="https://ocg.cancer.gov/programs/target">Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET)</a>. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Together, TCGA and TARGET represent some of the largest and most comprehensive cancer genomics datasets in the world, comprising more than two petabytes of data (one petabyte is equivalent to 223,000 DVDs filled to capacity with data). In addition, the GDC will accept submissions of cancer genomic and clinical data from researchers around the world who wish to share their data broadly. In so doing, researchers will be able to use the state-of-the-art analytic methods of the GDC, allowing them to compare their findings with other data in the GDC.</p>
<p>Data in the GDC, representing thousands of cancer patients and tumors, will be harmonized using standardized software algorithms so that they are accessible and broadly useful to any cancer researcher. The storage of raw genomic data in the GDC will also allow it to be reanalyzed as computational methods and genome annotations improve. It is important to note that, in this era of heightened concern about data security and authorized access, the GDC has important safeguards to ensure secure data storage and downloading.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With the GDC, NCI has made a major commitment to maintaining long-term storage of cancer genomic data and providing researchers with free access to these data,&rdquo; said NCI Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D. &ldquo;Importantly, the explanatory power of data in the GDC will grow over time as data from more patients are included, and ultimately the GDC will accelerate our efforts in precision medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The GDC is being built and managed by the University of Chicago <a href="http://cdis.uchicago.edu/"><span>Center for Data Intensive Science</span></a>, in collaboration with the <a href="http://oicr.on.ca/"><span>Ontario Institute for Cancer Research</span></a>, all under an NCI contract with Leidos Biomedical Research, Frederick, Maryland.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of particular significance, the GDC will also house data from a number of newer NCI programs that will sequence the DNA of patients enrolled in NCI clinical trials,&rdquo; said Louis M. Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., NCI. &ldquo;These datasets will lead to a much deeper understanding of which therapies are most effective for individual cancer patients. With each new addition, the GDC will evolve into a smarter, more comprehensive knowledge system that will foster important discoveries in cancer research and increase the success of cancer treatment for patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hope is that the GDC will form the basis for a comprehensive knowledge system for cancer. GDC researchers will be able to integrate genetic and clinical data, such as cancer imaging and histological data, with information on the molecular profiles of tumors as well as treatment response. From this perspective, the GDC would become an important resource for generating potentially actionable and life-changing information that ultimately could be used by doctors and their patients.<br /><br /></p>

<p><span>The recently launched Genomic Data Commons (GDC) will get a dramatic increase in the power and utility of its resources with the announcement today of the signing of a data sharing agreement between the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and Foundation Medicine, Inc. (FMI), a molecular information company that has generated genomic profiles of people with cancer. NCI&rsquo;s GDC is a unified data system that promotes the sharing of genomic and clinical data among researchers and is a core component of the Cancer Moonshot and the President&rsquo;s Precision Medicine Initiative. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</span></p>
<p><span>The expanded number of cancer cases in the GDC will allow researchers to identify genomic changes that are responsible for the cancerous growth of tumors in individual patients, and identify which drugs may block the effects of these mutations.&nbsp; Such targeted drugs can produce remissions in certain patients.</span></p>
<p><span>When the GDC was launched earlier this month, it was able to immediately capitalize on the genomic data that existed in several large-scale NCI programs, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and its pediatric equivalent, Therapeutically Applicable Research to Generate Effective Treatments (TARGET). Together, TCGA and TARGET represent some of the largest and most comprehensive cancer genomic datasets in the world, with information generated from about 14,500 patients.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span>The addition of data from 18,000 adult patients with a diverse array of cancers that underwent genomic profiling using FMI&rsquo;s proprietary comprehensive genomic profiling assay, called FoundationOne (trademark registered), will provide a major boost to the GDC. &nbsp;FMI developed FoundationOne as a commercially available test that uses advanced sequencing technology to routinely analyze cancer specimens. </span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;This major infusion of data in the GDC will greatly enhance our ability to use this tool to explore genetic abnormalities in cancer,&rdquo; said Douglas Lowy, M.D., NCI Acting Director. &ldquo;Through TCGA and TARGET, we had already established a strong cancer genomic foundation for the GDC at its launch, but with the addition of the genomic data from FMI, we believe that the GDC will be an even more useful resource for researchers worldwide to help us unravel the complexities of many forms of cancer.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Importantly, in both the NCI and the Foundation Medicine databases, all patient information has been de-identified, meaning that personal information, such as addresses, Social Security numbers, and other possible identifiers, are not present &mdash; only crucial genetic data and key demographic information are available.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to participate in this important global effort to transform patient care and to be the first commercial entity to contribute data to the NCI&rsquo;s GDC, which we believe underscores the quality, integrity and richness of the genomics information contained in Foundation Medicine databases,&rdquo; said Vincent Miller, M.D., chief medical officer, Foundation Medicine. &ldquo;The amount of genomics information within Foundation Medicine databases has reached unparalleled scale. The insights gleaned from this data release will be instrumental in accelerating research and development efforts for targeted agents and immunotherapies.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span>The genomics information contributed by Foundation Medicine can be used by authorized researchers following approval by an NIH Data Access Committee.&nbsp; Requesters must affirm that their use of the data is solely for biomedical research purposes and for publication or presentation in scientific journals or at research meetings.</span></p>

<p><span>The largest study ever to investigate how genetic and biological factors contribute to breast cancer risk among black women launched today. This collaborative research project will identify genetic factors that may underlie breast cancer disparities. The effort is funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health.</span></p>
<p><span>The Breast Cancer Genetic Study in African-Ancestry Populations initiative does not involve new patient enrollment but builds on years of research cooperation among investigators who are part of the African-American Breast Cancer Consortium, the African-American Breast Cancer Epidemiology and Risk (AMBER) Consortium, and the NCI Cohort Consortium. These investigators, who come from many different institutions, will share biospecimens, data, and resources from 18 previous studies, resulting in a study population of 20,000 black women with breast cancer.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;This effort is about making sure that all Americans &ndash; no matter their background &ndash; reap the same benefits from the promising advances of precision medicine. The exciting new approaches to cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment ring hollow unless we can effectively narrow the gap of cancer disparities, and this new research initiative will help us do that,&rdquo; said Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., acting director of NCI. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hopeful about where this new research can take us, not only in addressing the unique breast cancer profiles of African-American women, but also in learning more about the origin of cancer disparities.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Survival rates for women with breast cancer have been steadily improving over the past several decades. However, these improvements have not been shared equally; black women are more likely to die of their disease. Perhaps of most concern is that black women are more likely than white women to be diagnosed with aggressive subtypes of breast cancer. The rate of triple-negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype, is twice as high in black women as compared to white women.</span></p>
<p><span>The exact reasons for these persistent disparities are unclear, although studies suggest that they are the result of a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and societal factors, including access to health care. Large studies are needed to comprehensively examine these factors, and NCI is supporting several such efforts.</span></p>
<p><span>As part of the study, the genomes of 20,000 black women with breast cancer will be compared with those of 20,000 black women who do not have breast cancer. The genomes will also be compared to those of white women who have breast cancer. The project will investigate inherited genetic variations that are associated with breast cancer risk in black women compared to white women. In addition, researchers will examine gene expression in breast cancer tumor samples to investigate the genetic pathways that are involved in tumor development.</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;This $12 million grant&mdash;in combination with previous investments&mdash;should help advance our understanding of the social and biological causes that lead to disparities in cancer among underserved populations,&rdquo; said Robert Croyle, Ph.D., director of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS), which is administering the grant. &ldquo;A better understanding of the genetic contributions to differences in breast cancer diagnoses and outcomes among African-Americans may lead to better treatments and better approaches to cancer prevention.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>&ldquo;A number of studies have suggested that genetic factors may influence breast cancer disparities, so we&rsquo;re hopeful that this project can help to shed further light on this matter.&rdquo; said Damali Martin, Ph.D., program director for the DCCPS Genomic Epidemiology Branch. Dr. Martin&rsquo;s office is working directly with the grant recipients as well as the consortia groups that have been researching black women and breast cancer.</span></p>

<p><span>An international project to develop a large, globally accessible bank of new cancer cell culture models for the research community launched today. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health; Cancer Research UK, London, England; the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, England; and the foundation Hubrecht Organoid Technology, Utrecht, Netherlands, are joining forces to develop the Human Cancer Models Initiative (HCMI), which will bring together expertise from around the world to make about 1,000 cancer cell models. </span></p>
<p><span>Using new techniques to grow cells, scientists can make models that will better resemble the tissue architecture and complexity of human tumors than the cell lines used today.</span></p>
<p><span>Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., director of NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Genomics, said, &ldquo;As part of NCI&rsquo;s Precision Medicine Initiative in Oncology, this new project is timed perfectly to take advantage of the latest cell culture and genomic sequencing techniques to create models that are representative of patient tumors and are annotated with genomic and clinical information. This effort is a first step toward learning how to use these tools to design individualized treatments.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Genetic sequencing data from the tumors and derived models will be available to researchers, along with clinical data about the patients and their tumors. All information related to the models will be shared in a way that protects patient privacy. </span></p>
<p><span>Ian Walker, Ph.D., Cancer Research UK&rsquo;s director of clinical research and strategic partnerships, said, &ldquo;This exciting new project means that we can expand our resources for researchers around the world. We want scientists to have the best resources to be able to easily study all types of cancer. And these new cell lines could transform how we study cancer and could help to develop better treatments for patients.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span>Scientists will make the models using tissue from patients with different types of cancer, potentially including rare and children&rsquo;s cancers, which are often underrepresented or not available at all in existing cell line collections. The new models will have the potential to reflect the biology of tumors more accurately and better represent the overall cancer patient population. </span></p>
<p><span>The HCMI collaborators aim to speed up development of new models and to make research more efficient by avoiding unnecessary duplication of scientific efforts. </span></p>
<p><span>Mathew Garnett, Ph.D., group leader at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, said, &ldquo;New cancer model derivation technologies are allowing us to generate even more and improved cancer models for research. A concerted and coordinated effort to make new models will accelerate this process, while also allowing for rapid learning, protocol sharing, and standardized culturing methods.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span>HCMI could transform research and will allow scientists to study many aspects of cellular biology and cancer, including how the disease progresses, drug resistance, and the development of precision medicine treatments. </span></p>
<p><span>Hans Clevers, M.D., Ph.D., of the foundation Hubrecht Organoid Technology, said, &ldquo;We are delighted to take part in this global partnership to make new resources for researchers.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>A laboratory study has revealed an entirely unexpected process for acquiring drug resistance that bypasses the need to re-establish DNA damage repair in breast cancers that have mutant <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> genes. The findings, reported by Andre Nussenzweig, Ph.D., and Shyam Sharan, Ph.D., at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues, appeared July 21, 2016, in Nature.</p>
<p>In normal cells, the proteins BRCA1 and BRCA2 act as DNA damage sensors, surveyors, and responders. They help perform complex functions that facilitate the repair of damaged DNA.&nbsp; Individuals who inherit certain mutations in either the <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> gene have defective DNA repair and an increased risk of developing breast, ovarian, and other cancers. Specifically, mutations in <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> account for 20 percent to 25 percent of hereditary breast cancers and 5 percent to 10 percent of all breast cancers. The reduced ability to repair breaks in DNA in cells with a <em>BRCA1</em> or <em>BRCA2</em> mutation makes the cells sensitive to DNA damaging drugs. However, breast cancers eventually acquire resistance to these drugs. One documented mechanism for developing chemoresistance in such tumors is through the restoration of accurate DNA repair pathways that mend DNA breaks caused by chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Nussenzweig&rsquo;s laboratory has spent the past decade trying to understand the cellular mechanisms that regulate DNA repair in normal and pathogenic states. &ldquo;It is the intricate mechanisms that tumor cells evolve to bypass the need for accurate DNA repair that form the foundation of our study,&rdquo; said Nussenzweig. &ldquo;A deeper knowledge of the processes that drive drug resistance in <em>BRCA1/2</em>-mutant tumors will lead to novel therapeutic approaches that target tumor-specific vulnerabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In this study, the researchers linked the protection and stabilization of DNA replication forks as a major contributory mechanism to drug resistance in <em>BRCA1/2</em>-mutant breast and ovarian cancers. Replication is a cellular process that produces two indistinguishable DNA copies from a single DNA molecule. This DNA-copying process is an essential step in cellular division and occurs at defined locations called replication forks.</p>
<p>The movement of a replication fork as it migrates along a DNA molecule can be disrupted by the presence of a diverse group of DNA structures and proteins, collectively and loosely referred to as replication fork barriers. This interruption of replication fork migration results in what is called a stalled fork. Upon replication fork stalling, the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins are called upon to protect the newly synthesized strands of DNA. If these proteins are absent, the replication fork is destabilized and the newly synthesized DNA is degraded, which increases genomic instability and increases sensitivity to DNA-damaging drugs.</p>
<p>The investigators were able to identify other proteins, such as PTIP, CHD4 and PARP1, that actively promote replication fork destabilization through the recruitment of enzymes that degrade newly synthesized DNA. The absence of these proteins protected the DNA at replication forks and remarkably reversed the drug sensitivity of both <em>BRCA1-</em> and <em>BRCA2-</em>mutant cells, making them chemoresistant. These studies also highlighted the complex ways by which tumor cells can evade chemotherapeutic interventions and acquire drug resistance, since disrupting the activity of multiple proteins led to the same end point of replication fork protection. These results are of particular relevance in the clinical setting, where expression of these proteins appears to be an indicator of how patients with <em>BRCA1-</em> and <em>BRCA2-</em>mutant cancers will respond to chemotherapeutic treatment with DNA-damaging agents.</p>
<p>All together, these results underscore the importance of replication fork barriers to genomic instability and drug sensitivity in the context of <em>BRCA1/2</em> mutations. The results also suggest that the cellular levels of these proteins could be used as a prognostic factor in acquired resistance in <em>BRCA1/2</em>-mutant cancers.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our work is starting to not only refine, but also redefine, the current dogma in the field, which states that restoring DNA repair pathways are the only means by which <em>BRCA1/2</em>-mutant cells can become chemoresistant,&rdquo; concluded Nussenzweig.</p>

<p>Researchers have identified a mechanism in mice by which anticancer immune responses are inhibited within the lungs, a common site of metastasis for many cancers. This mechanism involves oxygen inhibition of the anticancer activity of T cells. Inhibiting the oxygen-sensing capability of immune cells, either genetically or pharmacologically, prevented lung metastasis. This research was conducted by Nicholas Restifo, M.D., Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute (NCI) and others at NCI as well as colleagues at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, both parts of the National Institutes of Health. The findings appeared August 25, 2016, in the journal Cell.</p>
<p>Metastasis is the cause of most cancer deaths. It has long been hypothesized that the process of cancer metastasis requires cooperation between spreading cancer cells and the cellular environment to which they spread. A key component of that environment is the local immune system, which can act to fight off invading cancer cells.</p>
<p>The researchers discovered that T cells, a type of immune cell, contain a group of oxygen-sensing proteins which act to limit inflammation within the lungs. This new research shows, however, that oxygen also suppresses the anticancer activity of T cells, thereby permitting cancer cells that have spread to the lungs to escape immune attack and establish metastatic colonies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since the lung is one of the most frequent sites to which cancers spread, we hypothesized that there might be unique immunologic processes that aid tumor cells in their ability to establish themselves in the lung. Because oxygen is a pervasive local environmental factor in the lung, we wanted to examine what role oxygen might play in regulating immunity in the lung,&rdquo; said David Clever, a M.D., Ph.D. candidate who trained in Restifo&rsquo;s lab, and has now returned to the Ohio State University College of Medicine.</p>
<p>The research team discovered that oxygen-sensing proteins, called prolyl hydroxylase domain (PHD) proteins, act within T cells to prevent overly strong immune responses to harmless particles that frequently enter the lung. This protective mechanism also allows circulating cancer cells to get a foothold in the lung. Specifically, the researchers found that PHD proteins promote the development of regulatory T cells, a type of T cell that suppresses the activity of other parts of the immune system. They also found that PHD proteins limit the development of inflammatory T cells and restrain their ability to produce molecules involved in cancer killing.</p>
<p>To test whether PHD proteins promote tumor cells to grow in the lung, the researchers used a &ldquo;knockout&rdquo; mouse strain that lacks PHD proteins in its T cells. These PHD-knock-out mice, as well as unaltered normal mice, were injected with melanoma cells. Strikingly, whereas normal mice showed large amounts of cancerous melanoma cells in the lungs, the mice whose T cells lacked PHD proteins showed almost no evidence of melanoma in the lungs.</p>
<p>Given their finding that PHD proteins suppress the inflammatory immune response in the lung, the researchers wondered whether inhibiting them might improve the efficacy of adoptive cell transfer, a type of immunotherapy that harnesses the ability of a patient&rsquo;s own T cells to recognize and attack cancer. In adoptive cell transfer, T cells are extracted from a patient&rsquo;s tumor tissue, expanded to great numbers in the laboratory, and then administered intravenously into the patient along with a T-cell growth factor, with hopes that these cells will return to sites of cancer and eliminate it.</p>
<p>For these experiments, the research team expanded the antitumor T cells in the presence of a drug called dimethyloxaloylglycine (DMOG), which blocks the activity of PHD proteins. In the lab, the drug treatment improved the cancer-killing properties of the T cells and when administered to mice with established metastatic cancer, the drug-treated T cells were far better at eliminating cancer than untreated T cells. DMOG treatment has also been found to improve the cancer-killing properties of human T cells in other studies. The application of these findings to human adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy clinical trials is being investigated by Restifo&rsquo;s group.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adoptive cell transfer immunotherapy provides a unique opportunity for manipulation of a patient&rsquo;s own T cells out of the body,&rdquo; said Restifo. &ldquo;Although our finding is in mice, we are eager to test whether disruption of the oxygen sensing machinery in T cells -- with drugs, genetics, or regulation of environmental oxygen -- will enhance the efficacy of T-cell mediated immune therapies for cancer in humans.&rdquo;</p>

<p>National Cancer Institute (NCI) Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D., today accepted the <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=57&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=2297&amp;sys_contentid=1038006" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_dependentvariantid="2297" sys_dependentid="1038006" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_relationshipid="6474516">recommendations of a Blue Ribbon Panel (BRP)</a> on 10 scientific approaches most likely to make a decade&rsquo;s worth of progress against cancer in five years under the Cancer Moonshot. The report was presented by the BRP to the National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB), and it was subsequently considered and accepted by the NCAB&nbsp;with revisions that reflect NCAB&rsquo;s discussion. An overview of the report was published today in the journal <em>Science</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The bold but feasible cross-cutting initiatives in this report will improve outcomes for patients with cancer, prevent cancer and increase our understanding of cancer,&rdquo; said Dr. Lowy. &ldquo;NCI stands ready to accelerate cancer research in the critical areas identified by the Blue Ribbon Panel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In January 2016, during his State of the Union address, President Obama announced the Cancer Moonshot &ldquo;for the loved ones we&rsquo;ve all lost, for the families we can still save.&rdquo; The NCI&rsquo;s scientific road map outlined by the BRP is one component of the Cancer Moonshot&rsquo;s broader effort focused on accelerating progress on the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer. Under the Vice President&rsquo;s leadership, a full set of recommendations for leveraging federal investments, private sector efforts, patient initiatives and more under the mission will be announced later this fall.</p>
<p>The 10 transformative approaches poised for acceleration are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Engage patients to contribute their comprehensive tumor profile data to expand knowledge about what therapies work, in whom, and in which types of cancer.</li>
<li>Establish a cancer immunotherapy clinical trials network devoted exclusively to discovering and evaluating immunotherapy approaches.</li>
<li>Identify therapeutic targets to overcome drug resistance through studies that determine the mechanisms that lead cancer cells to become resistant to previously effective treatments.</li>
<li>Create a national ecosystem for sharing and analyzing cancer data so that researchers, clinicians and patients will be able to contribute data, which will facilitate efficient data analysis.</li>
<li>Improve our understanding of fusion oncoproteins in pediatric cancer and use new preclinical models to develop inhibitors that target them.</li>
<li>Accelerate the development of guidelines for routine monitoring and management of patient-reported symptoms to minimize debilitating side effects of cancer and its treatment.</li>
<li>Reduce cancer risk and cancer health disparities through approaches in development, testing and broad adoption of proven prevention strategies.</li>
<li>Predict response to standard treatments through retrospective analysis of patient specimens.</li>
<li>Create dynamic 3-D maps of human tumor evolution to document the genetic lesions and cellular interactions of each tumor as it evolves from a precancerous lesion to advanced cancer.</li>
<li>Develop new enabling cancer technologies to characterize tumors and test therapies.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to the coalescence of new scientific insights and technological innovations, cancer research is poised to make unprecedented advances,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. &ldquo;The approaches identified by the Blue Ribbon Panel offer exceptional promise in tipping the odds in favor of cancer patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In addition to the 10 scientific approaches, the road map has specific, special projects. These include a demonstration project to test for Lynch syndrome, a heritable genetic condition that increases risk of several types of cancer, to improve early detection and prevention; the establishment of a nationwide pediatric immunotherapy clinical trials network to enhance the speed with which new immunotherapies can be tested in children; exploring patient-derived organoids; and &ldquo;microdosing&rdquo; devices to test drug responses in living tumors.</p>
<p>The Cancer Moonshot scientific road map creates a vision for the future of cancer research and treatment in which:</p>
<ul>
<li>Patients contribute their data, obtain genomic profiling information about their tumor, learn about what treatments might work best given their tumor&rsquo;s genomic profile and find other relevant information, including clinical trials that may be appropriate.</li>
<li>Researchers can identify possible targets for the development of new treatments and preventive interventions, including immunotherapies, as well as learn more about how to avoid or counter drug resistance.</li>
<li>Doctors have access to information that better predicts treatment outcomes and helps control patients&rsquo; symptoms and side effects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dr. Lowy will share the report with the Cancer Moonshot Task Force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NCI greatly appreciates Vice President Biden&rsquo;s leadership of and passion for the Cancer Moonshot. The Vice President has galvanized the community to move forward so we can greatly improve our ability to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer,&rdquo; said Dr. Lowy. &ldquo;The efforts of the BRP and working group members have been extraordinary, and I thank them for their time, energy and ideas. I am confident that the cancer community will build on this effort and seize this unprecedented opportunity to accelerate progress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A clinical trial has shown that patients with a specific molecular subtype of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) are more likely to respond to the drug ibrutinib (Imbruvica) than patients with another molecular subtype of the disease. The study appeared online July 20, 2015, in Nature Medicine.</p>

<p>In this phase II trial, patients with the activated B-cell-like (ABC) subtype of DLBCL were more likely to respond to ibrutinib than patients with the germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) subtype of DLBCL. The trial was jointly conducted by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is part of the National Institutes of Health, and Pharmacyclics, Sunnyvale, California.</p>

<p>Lymphomas are caused by an abnormal proliferation of white blood cells and can occur at any age. DLBCL is an aggressive form of lymphoma that grows rapidly but is potentially curable. The disease accounts for approximately 30 percent of newly diagnosed lymphomas in the United States.</p>

<p>Several years ago, NCI scientists identified the two primary subtypes of DLBCL based on characteristic patterns of gene activity within the lymphoma cells. The discovery of these subtypes suggested to the researchers that targeted treatments could be developed for each subtype.</p>

<p>Building on this work, the trial enrolled 80 patients with DLBCL that had relapsed or had not responded to prior treatment. All patients received ibrutinib. Tumor responses were seen in 25 percent of patients overall, including eight patients with complete responses and 12 with partial responses.</p>

<p>For the study population as a whole, after a median follow-up of 11.5 months, the median progression-free survival (the time until the disease worsened) and overall survival were 1.6 months and 6.4 months, respectively.</p>

<p>An analysis based on disease subtype showed that ibrutinib produced complete or partial responses in 37 percent (14 of 38) of patients with ABC DLBCL but only 5 percent (1 of 20) of patients with GCB DLBCL. Based on these results, the researchers concluded that, for future clinical trials involving ibrutinib, the ABC DLBCL gene signature could be used to identify patients who would be more likely to respond to the drug.</p>

<p>DLBCL originates from B cells, which play a crucial role in the body’s immune response. The target for ibrutinib, an enzyme called Bruton’s tyrosine kinase (BTK), is a key component of B-cell receptor signaling. The new study provides the first clinical evidence that ABC but not GBC tumors may produce abnormal B-cell receptor signals that promote the survival of cancer cells by activating BTK, thereby accounting for the sensitivity of ABC tumors to ibrutinib.</p>

<p>“Clinical trials such as this are critical for translating basic molecular findings into effective therapies,” said Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., NCI Center for Cancer Genomics, who co-led the study and discovered the role of B-cell receptor signaling in ABC DLBCL. Study co-leader Wyndham Wilson, M.D., Ph.D., NCI Center for Cancer Research, added, “This is the first clinical study to demonstrate the importance of precision medicine in lymphomas.”<br />
<br />
Based on this study’s results, an international phase III trial of standard chemotherapy with or without ibrutinib in patients with DLBCL, excluding the GCB subtype, is being conducted by Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Titusville, New Jersey, in collaboration with Drs. Wilson and Staudt. (ClinicalTrials.gov <a href="https://www.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT01855750?term=NCT01855750&#38;rank=1">NCT01855750</a>). This is the first time a phase III trial has been designed to selectively enroll patients with a particular molecular subtype of DLBCL. The study’s objective is to determine if the addition of ibrutinib to standard chemotherapy can increase the cure rate of patients with ABC DLBCL.</p>

<p>Ibrutinib has been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of certain patients with several other cancers, including mantle cell lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and Waldenström macroglobulinemia.</p>

<p>People who consistently smoked an average of less than one cigarette per day over their lifetimes had a 64 percent higher risk of earlier death than never smokers, and those who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes a day had an 87 percent higher risk of earlier death than never smokers, according to a new study from researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). Risks were lower among former low-intensity smokers compared to those who were still smokers, and risk fell with earlier age at quitting. The results of the study were reported December 5, 2016, in JAMA Internal Medicine. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>When researchers looked at specific causes of death among study participants, a particularly strong association was observed for lung cancer mortality. Those who consistently averaged less than one cigarette per day over their lifetime had nine times the risk of dying from lung cancer than never smokers. Among people who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes per day, the risk of dying from lung cancer was nearly 12 times higher than that of never smokers.</p>
<p>The researchers looked at risk of death from respiratory disease, such as emphysema, as well as the risk of death from cardiovascular disease. People who smoked between one and 10 cigarettes a day had over six times the risk of dying from respiratory diseases than never smokers and about one and one-half times the risk of dying of cardiovascular disease than never smokers.</p>
<p>Smoking has many harmful effects on health, which have been detailed in numerous studies since the U.S. Surgeon General&rsquo;s 1964 report linking smoking to lung cancer. The health effects of consistent low-intensity smoking, however, have not been well studied and many smokers believe that low-intensity smoking does not affect their health.</p>
<p>To better understand the effects of low-intensity smoking on mortality from all causes and for specific causes of death, the scientists analyzed data on over 290,000 adults in the NIH-AARP Diet and Health Study. Low-intensity smoking was defined as 10 or fewer cigarettes per day. All participants were age 59 to age 82 at the start of the study.</p>
<p>Participants were asked about their smoking behaviors during nine periods across their lives, beginning with before they reached their 15<sup>th</sup> birthday until after they reached the age of 70 (for the older participants). Among current smokers, 159 reported smoking less than one cigarette per day consistently throughout the years that they smoked; nearly 1,500 reported smoking between one and 10 cigarettes per day.</p>
<p>The study relied on people recalling their smoking history over many decades, which introduced a degree of uncertainty into the findings. Also, despite the large number of people surveyed, the number of consistent low-intensity smokers was relatively small.</p>
<p>Another limitation of the study is that the participants were mostly white and in their 60s and 70s, so the smoking patterns collected in the study reflect only a particular set of age groups in the United States. Future studies among younger populations and other racial and ethnic groups are needed, particularly as low-intensity smoking has historically been more common among racial and ethnic minorities in the US. The study also lacked detailed information about usage patterns among participants who reported smoking less than one cigarette per day. Hence, the researchers could not compare the effects of smoking every other day, every few days, or weekly, for example.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The results of this study support health warnings that there is no safe level of exposure to tobacco smoke,&rdquo; said Maki Inoue-Choi, Ph.D., NCI, Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and lead author of the study. &ldquo;Together, these findings indicate that smoking even a small number of cigarettes per day has substantial negative health effects and provide further evidence that smoking cessation benefits all smokers, regardless of how few cigarettes they smoke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Researchers, using novel large-scale imaging technology, have mapped the spatial location of individual genes in the nucleus of human cells and identified 50 cellular factors required for the proper three-dimensional (3D) positioning of genes. These spatial locations play important roles in gene expression, DNA repair, genome stability, and other cellular activities. The study, by scientists at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, appeared August 13, 2015, in <i>Cell</i>.</p>

<p>One of the fundamental properties of the genomes of higher organisms is the non-random arrangement of DNA in the cell nucleus. Researchers have long known that most genes occupy preferred 3D positions in the nucleus and that the location of genes matters for their function, but it has been difficult to determine the molecular players and mechanisms that determine the positions. Although genes can be visualized routinely and their positions determined using fluorescence in situ hybridization, or FISH, this mapping method has traditionally been limited to the analysis of a few samples at a time and cannot be used for large-scale genome mapping.</p>

<p>NCI researchers, in close collaboration with NCI’s High-Throughput Imaging Facility, which was established earlier this decade, have developed a method called HIPMap (High-throughput Imaging Position Mapping) that makes the large-scale determination of 3D gene positions possible. This method uses an optimized FISH detection protocol, fully automated microscopy, and combines it with sophisticated computational image analysis that delivers high-precision gene mapping information for thousands of samples in a single experiment.</p>

<p>In the study, NCI researchers, led by Tom Misteli, Ph.D., associate director, NCI Center for Cancer Research, used HIPMap and a method known as RNA interference (RNAi) knockdown to screen nearly 700 proteins in the nucleus to identify those that are involved in the 3D positioning of several human genes. RNAi knockdown uses RNA molecules to block the production of specific proteins in cells.</p>

<p>By collecting data continuously from automated microscopes for 27 days and then analyzing more than three million data points, the scientists were able to identify 50 cellular factors that determine the location of genes in the cell nucleus. This list provides the basis for further investigation of the molecular mechanisms of genome organization.</p>

<p>“The importance of HIPMap is that it is a starting point for numerous applications, including cancer biology,” said Misteli. “In addition to addressing basic questions about the mechanisms of how genomes are organized in intact cells, the ability to map gene positions in a large number of samples and cells has already been used to detect very rare chromosome translocation events in cancer and to ask what cellular factors determine where chromosomes break.” &#160;During translocations, chromosomes break and reattach, which can cause the fusion of otherwise unconnected genes, resulting in hybrid genes whose protein products may contribute to the development of cancer.</p>

<p>As an example of the implications of HIPMap, Misteli pointed to a study from his lab published last month (Burman et al., Genes and Development. July 1, 2015). &#160;In that study researchers used a method derived from HIPMap to probe mechanisms that contribute to the susceptibility of chromosomes to break and form a cancer-causing translocation between the <i>NPM1</i> gene and the <i>ALK</i> gene in a cancer known as anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Another possible application of HIPMap is in cancer diagnostics. The researchers have previously shown that some genes assume distinct positions in cancer. As a result, the 3D positions of genes could be used as diagnostic markers in diseases such as breast cancer and prostate cancer.</p>

<p style=" text-align: left;">“HIPMap will be a powerful tool in many ongoing efforts to map the genome in 3D space and to translate the findings from these studies to cancer biology,” Misteli concluded.</p>

<p>In an early-phase clinical trial of a new oral drug, selumetinib, children with the common genetic disorder neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and plexiform neurofibromas, tumors of the peripheral nerves, tolerated selumetinib and, in most cases, responded to it with tumor shrinkage. NF1 affects 1 in 3,000 people. The study results appeared Dec. 29, 2016, in the New England Journal of Medicine.</p>
<p>The multicenter phase I clinical trial, which included 24 patients, was led by Brigitte C. Widemann, M.D., acting chief of the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s (NCI) Pediatric Oncology Branch, and was sponsored by NCI&rsquo;s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. The study, conducted at the NIH Clinical Center and three participating sites, took advantage of techniques developed by Dr. Widemann&rsquo;s team that enabled very precise measurement of the plexiform neurofibromas. Experiments in mice that developed neurofibromas due to genetic modifications were performed at Cincinnati Children&rsquo;s Hospital in the laboratory of Nancy Ratner, Ph.D. &nbsp;NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Plexiform neurofibromas develop in up to 50 percent of people with NF1. The majority of these tumors, which can cause significant pain, disability, and disfigurement, are diagnosed in early childhood and grow most rapidly prior to adolescence. Complete surgical removal of the tumors is rarely feasible, and incompletely resected tumors tend to grow back.</p>
<p>The primary aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the toxicity and safety of selumetinib in patients with NF1 and inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, and, encouragingly, most of the selumetinib-related toxic effects were mild. At present, no therapies are considered effective for NF1-related large plexiform neurofibromas, but, in this trial, partial responses, meaning 20 percent or more reduction in tumor volume, were observed in over 70 percent of the patients.</p>
<p>Responses were observed in tumors that were previously growing at a rate of greater than 20 percent per year, as well as in non-progressing lesions. Tumor shrinkage was maintained long term, for approximately two years, and, as of early 2016, no disease progression had been observed in any trial participant. Additionally, anecdotal evidence of clinical improvement, such as a decrease in tumor-related pain, improvement in motor function, and decreased disfigurement, was reported.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some may say that a 20 percent volume reduction is too small to be meaningful, but to me, just stopping the growth of these devastating tumors is an important achievement,&rdquo; said Dr. Widemann.&nbsp; &ldquo;The difference we see in these patients is truly unprecedented.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The disease-causing gene for NF1 was first identified in 1990 by two independent teams, one of them led by NIH Director Francis S. Collins, Ph.D., M.D., who at the time was chief of Medical Genetics at the University of Michigan. The other team was led by Ray White at the University of Utah. Research to understand the gene&rsquo;s function revealed that deregulation of the RAS signaling pathway was the most likely cause of tumor development. Numerous drugs that target RAS-related signaling pathways have been tested in patients with NF1 in phase I and phase II clinical trials, with disappointing results, hence the interest in selumetinib.</p>
<p>Selumetinib, provided for the study by AstraZeneca, is a selective inhibitor of the MEK protein, a part of the complex network of RAS signaling pathways. The drug has demonstrated activity in some advanced cancers, but it is not yet approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States. It is manufactured in capsule form to be taken orally. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Trial enrollment began in September 2011 and 24 children (11 girls, 13 boys) participated. Twice daily doses of the medicine were taken continuously, over a median of 30 month-long treatment cycles. The majority of patients are still continuing with therapy, some for as long as five years, and the long-term treatment has had no observed adverse effect on their development or overall health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Experiments in mice with similar neurofibromas confirmed the inhibition of the MEK protein function in the tumors. Inhibition of the MEK protein diminished as early as two hours after drug administration. In addition, the animals received treatment with regular interruptions and still demonstrated tumor responses. This indicates that even limited MEK inhibition could cause tumor shrinkage in this disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the future, we may wish to look at intermittent dosing in patients to minimize toxicity and retain maximal outcomes,&rdquo; said Dr. Widemann.</p>
<p>In some patients, a loss of response to selumetinib with slow regrowth of tumors was observed, particularly after dose reductions. The researchers believe that additional studies are warranted to characterize tumors that no longer respond to selumetinib. NCI is currently sponsoring an ongoing phase II trial of the drug for adults with NF1, in which serial tissue samples are being obtained. This study should provide information about possible mechanisms of resistance to selumetinib.</p>
<p>In addition, a larger phase II pediatric trial is enrolling patients and should help establish the efficacy of selumetinib treatment in children. In this trial, in addition to tumor volume measurements, evaluations are being performed to assess the effect of selumetinib on plexiform neurofibroma related disfigurement, pain, quality of life, and function.</p>
<p>This research was supported by NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research and the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program; by the Children&rsquo;s Tumor Foundation to Michael Fisher to support participating sites other than the NCI;&nbsp; by AstraZeneca providing selumetinib and funding for the pharmacokinetic analysis; and by grants from the Children&rsquo;s Tumor Foundation and the Neurofibromatosis Therapeutic Acceleration Program (to Dr. Ratner for the mouse preclinical trials).</p>

<p>&ldquo;The NCI Formulary will help researchers begin testing promising drug combinations more quickly, potentially helping patients much sooner,&rdquo; said NCI Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D. &ldquo;Rather than spending time negotiating agreements, investigators will be able to focus on the important research that can ultimately lead to improved cancer care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The NCI Formulary launched today with&nbsp;<a href="https://nciformulary.cancer.gov/available_agents/default.htm">fifteen targeted agents</a> from six pharmaceutical companies:</p>
<ul>
<li>Bristol-Myers Squibb</li>
<li>Eli Lilly and Company</li>
<li>Genentech</li>
<li>Kyowa Hakko Kirin&nbsp;</li>
<li>Loxo Oncology</li>
<li>Xcovery Holding Company LLC</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The agreements with these companies demonstrate our shared commitment to expedite cancer clinical trials and improve outcomes for patients,&rdquo; said James Doroshow, M.D., NCI Deputy Director for Clinical and Translational Research. &ldquo;It represents a new drug development paradigm that will enhance the efficiency with which new treatments are discovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The establishment of the NCI Formulary will enable NCI to act as an intermediary between investigators at NCI-designated Cancer Centers and participating pharmaceutical companies, facilitating and streamlining the arrangements for access to and use of pharmaceutical agents. Following company approval, investigators will be able to obtain agents from the available formulary list and test them in new preclinical or clinical studies, including combination studies of formulary agents from different companies.</p>
<p>The NCI Formulary leverages lessons learned through NCI&rsquo;s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program (CTEP) and the NCI-MATCH trial, a study in which targeted agents from different companies are being tested alone or in combination in patients with genetic mutations that are targeted by these drugs. As the use of genomic sequencing data becomes more common in selecting cancer therapies, requests for access to multiple targeted agents for the conduct of clinical trials are becoming more common.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are very pleased that several additional pharmaceutical companies have already pledged a willingness to participate and are in various stages of negotiation with NCI,&rdquo; said Dr. Doroshow, who is also director of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. &ldquo;By the end of 2017, we expect to have doubled the number of partnerships and drugs available in the NCI Formulary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>CTEP staff continue to discuss the NCI Formulary with pharmaceutical companies to make additional proprietary agents available for studies initiated by investigators at NCI-designated Cancer Centers.</p>
<p>The Formulary will complement NIH&rsquo;s plans for another new public-private partnership in oncology, the Partnership to Accelerate Cancer Therapies (PACT). Through PACT, the NIH, U.S. Food and Drug Administration, biopharmaceutical groups in the private sector, foundations, and cancer advocacy organizations will come together to support new research projects to accelerate progress in cancer research as part of the Cancer Moonshot. PACT research will center on the identification and validation of biomarkers of response and resistance to cancer therapies, with special emphasis on immunotherapies. PACT will also establish a platform for selecting and testing combination therapies. PACT is expected to launch in 2017.</p>

<p>Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have identified novel genomic and molecular characteristics of cervical cancer that will aid in the subclassification of the disease and may help target therapies that are most appropriate for each patient. The new study, a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of 178 primary cervical cancers, found that over 70 percent of the tumors had genomic alterations in either one or both of two important cell signaling pathways. The researchers also found, unexpectedly, that a subset of tumors did not show evidence of human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. The study included authors from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), both parts of the National Institutes of Health, and appeared January 23, 2017, in <em>Nature</em>.</p>
<p>Cervical cancer accounts for more than 500,000 new cases of cancer and more than 250,000 deaths each year worldwide. &ldquo;The vast majority of cases of cervical cancer are caused by persistent infection with oncogenic types of HPV. Effective preventive vaccines against the most oncogenic forms of HPV have been available for a number of years, with vaccination having the long-term potential to reduce the number of cases of cervical cancer,&rdquo; said NCI Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D.</p>
<p>&ldquo;However, most women who will develop cervical cancer in the next couple of decades are already beyond the recommended age for vaccination and will not be protected by the vaccine,&rdquo; noted Dr. Lowy. &ldquo;Therefore, cervical cancer is still a disease in need of effective therapies, and this latest TCGA analysis could help advance efforts to find drugs that target important elements of cervical cancer genomes in addition to the HPV genes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>An aspect of the study that is of particular interest was the identification of a unique set of eight cervical cancers that showed molecular similarities to endometrial cancers. These endometrial-like cancers were mainly HPV-negative, and they all had high frequencies of mutations in the <em>KRAS, ARID1A</em>, and<em> PTEN</em> genes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The identification of HPV-negative endometrial-like tumors confirms that not all cervical cancers are related to HPV infection and that a small percentage of cervical tumors may be due to strictly genetic or other factors,&rdquo; noted Jean-Claude Zenklusen, Ph.D., director of NCI&rsquo;s TCGA program office. &ldquo;This aspect of the research is one of the most intriguing findings to come out of the TCGA program, which has been looking at more than 30 tumor types over the past decade.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because immunotherapies are becoming increasingly important for cancer therapy, the investigators examined genes that code for known immune targets to see if any were amplified, which may predict responsiveness to immunotherapy. They found amplification of several such genes, specifically <em>CD274</em> (which encodes the PD-L1 immune checkpoint protein) and <em>PDCD1LG2</em> (which encodes the PD-L2 immune checkpoint protein). Several checkpoint inhibitors have been shown to be effective immunotherapeutic agents. In addition, the TCGA analysis identified several novel mutated genes in cervical cancer, including<em> MED1</em>, <em>ERBB3</em>, <em>CASP8</em>, <em>HLA</em>-<em>A</em>, and <em>TGFBR2</em>. The researchers also identified several cases with gene fusions involving the gene <em>BCAR4</em>, which produces a long noncoding RNA that has been shown to induce responsiveness to lapatinib, an oral drug that inhibits a key pathway in breast cancer. Therefore, <em>BCAR4</em> may be a potential therapeutic target for cervical cancers with this alteration.</p>
<p>When analyzing the biology behind the molecular alterations in these tumors, the researchers found that nearly three-quarters of cervical cancers had genomic alterations in either one or both of the PI3K/MAPK and TGF-beta signaling pathways, which may also provide targets for therapy. The authors noted that an important question raised by this study is whether HPV-positive and HPV-negative tumors will respond differently to targeted therapies.</p>

<p>Premature death rates have declined in the United States among Hispanics, blacks, and Asian/Pacific Islanders (APIs)&mdash;in line with trends in Canada and the United Kingdom&mdash;but increased among whites and American Indian/Alaska Natives (AI/ANs), according to a comprehensive study of premature death rates for the entire U.S. population from 1999 to 2014. This divergence was reported by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), and colleagues at the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), both part of the National Institutes of Health, and the University of New Mexico College of Nursing. The findings appeared January 25, 2017, in <em>The Lancet</em>.</p>
<p>Declining rates of premature death (i.e., deaths among 25- to 64-year-olds) among Hispanics, blacks, and APIs were due mainly to fewer deaths from cancer, heart disease, and HIV over the time period of the study. The decline reflects successes in public health efforts to reduce tobacco use and medical advances to improve diagnosis and treatment. Whites also experienced fewer premature deaths from cancer and, for most ages, fewer deaths from heart disease over the study period. Despite these substantial improvements, overall premature death rates still remained higher for black men and women than for whites.</p>

<p>In contrast, overall premature death rates for whites and AI/ANs were driven up by dramatic increases in deaths from accidents (primarily drug overdoses), as well as suicide and liver disease. Among 25- to 30-year-old whites and AI/ANs, the investigators observed increases in death rates as high as 2 percent to 5 percent per year, comparable to those increases observed at the height of the U.S. AIDS epidemic.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The results of our study suggest that, in addition to continued efforts against cancer, heart disease, and HIV, there is an urgent need for aggressive actions targeting emerging causes of death, namely drug overdoses, suicide, and liver disease,&rdquo; said Meredith Shiels, Ph.D., M.H.S., Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), NCI, and lead author of the study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Death at any age is devastating for those left behind, but premature death is especially so, in particular for children and parents,&rdquo; emphasized Amy Berrington, D.Phil., also of DCEG and senior author of the study. &ldquo;We focused on premature deaths because, as Sir Richard Doll, the eminent epidemiologist and my mentor, observed: &lsquo;Death in old age is inevitable, but death before old age is not.&rsquo; Our study can be used to target prevention and surveillance efforts to help those groups in greatest need.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study findings were based on death certificate data collected by the National Center for Health Statistics, part of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</p>

<p>The largest study to date of African-American cancer survivors in the United States is underway. The Detroit Research on Cancer Survivors (ROCS) study, which will include 5,560 cancer survivors, will support a broad research agenda looking at the major factors affecting cancer progression, recurrence, mortality, and quality of life among African-American cancer survivors. The effort is funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>The grant, for $9 million over five years, has been awarded to Ann G. Schwartz, Ph.D., M.P.H., deputy center director, and Terrance Albrecht, Ph.D., associate director for Population Sciences of the Wayne State University School of Medicine and the Karmanos Cancer Institute, Detroit. &nbsp;</p>
<p>African Americans continue to experience disproportionately higher cancer incidence rates than other racial/ethnic groups in the United States for most cancer types. They are also more likely to be diagnosed with more-advanced-stage disease and experience higher cancer mortality rates than other groups. The Detroit ROCS study will focus on lung, breast, prostate, and colorectal cancers&mdash;the four most common types of cancer&mdash;each of which is marked by poorer survival rates among African Americans than whites.</p>
Multiple factors may contribute to poorer outcomes among African Americans with cancer, but most studies lack enough participants to adequately study these factors. The Detroit ROCS study will investigate the myriad factors that may affect cancer survival, including type of treatment, coexisting diseases, genetics, social structure, support, neighborhood context, poverty, stress, racial discrimination, literacy, quality of life, and behavioral factors such as smoking, alcohol use, diet, and physical activity. A unique aspect of this study is the inclusion of 2,780 family members to help researchers understand how a cancer diagnosis affects the mental, physical, and financial health of those providing care.
<p>&ldquo;This study is uniquely poised to investigate the major factors affecting African-American cancer survivors,&rdquo; said Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., acting director of NCI. &ldquo;Efforts like this will help us move toward bridging the gap of cancer disparities, ensuring that advances in cancer prevention, diagnosis, and treatment reach all Americans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Detroit ROCS will collect comprehensive data through interviews with participants, information from medical records, and the collection of biospecimens from participants who live in the three counties surrounding Detroit. These counties account for more than 70 percent of Michigan&rsquo;s African-American population, and approximately 21,000 people in these counties are diagnosed with cancer every year.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Investigating the complex factors that lead to disparities in cancer among underserved populations should lead to a greater understanding of the social and biological causes of such differences,&rdquo; said Robert Croyle, Ph.D., director of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences (DCCPS). &ldquo;And our hope is that this knowledge will lead to better outcomes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The study leverages the Detroit area population-based cancer registry, which is part of NCI&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program, to identify African Americans who have recently been diagnosed with cancer. NCI&rsquo;s SEER Program supports cancer registries and provides information on cancer statistics in an effort to reduce the cancer burden among the U.S. population.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Detroit ROCS&rsquo; use of the SEER Program is a great example of an efficient use of an existing structure to rapidly recruit cancer survivors into research studies,&rdquo; said Joanne Elena, Ph.D., M.P.H., scientific program director for this grant in DCCPS&rsquo;s Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is still much to understand about the poorer outcomes experienced by African-American cancer survivors,&rdquo; Dr. Elena said. &ldquo;We hope that information collected in the Detroit ROCS study will facilitate research that explains the interaction among environmental, genomic, social, and behavioral factors in this understudied population and ultimately identify ways for cancer survivors to live healthier lives.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Overall cancer death rates continue to decrease in men, women, and children for all major racial and ethnic groups, according to the latest Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer, 1975-2014. The report finds that death rates during the period 2010-2014 decreased for 11 of the 16 most common types of cancer in men and for 13 of the 18 most common types of cancer in women, including lung, colorectal, female breast, and prostate cancers. Meanwhile, death rates increased for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and brain in men and for liver and uterine cancer in women. The report finds overall cancer incidence rates, or rates of new cancers, decreased in men but stabilized in women during the period 1999-2013.</p>
<p>The Report to the Nation is released each year in a collaborative effort by the American Cancer Society; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), both parts of the Department of Health and Human Services; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR).</p>
<p>The report appears early online in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> (<em>JNCI</em>) and includes a special section, which this year focuses on survival expressed as percentage. It finds that several but not all cancer types showed a significant improvement over time for both early- and late-stage disease, and varied significantly by race/ethnicity and state.</p>
<p>&ldquo;While trends in death rates are the most commonly used measure to assess progress against cancer, survival trends are also an important measure to evaluate progress in improvement of cancer outcomes,&rdquo; said Ahmedin Jemal, D.V.M., Ph.D., of the American Cancer Society and lead author of the study. &ldquo;We last included a special section on cancer survival in 2004, and as we found then, survival improved over time for almost all cancers at every stage of diagnosis. But survival remains very low for some types of cancer and for most types of cancers diagnosed at an advanced stage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Compared to cases diagnosed in 1975-1977, five-year survival for cancers diagnosed in 2006-2012 increased significantly for all but two types of cancer: cervix and uterus. The greatest absolute increases in survival (25 percent or greater) were seen in prostate and kidney cancers as well as non-Hodgkin lymphoma, myeloma, and leukemia.</p>
<p>Cancers with the lowest five-year relative survival for cases diagnosed in 2006-2012 were pancreas (8.5 percent), liver (18.1 percent), lung (18.7 percent), esophagus (20.5 percent), stomach (31.1 percent) and brain (35 percent); those with the highest were prostate (99.3 percent), thyroid (98.3 percent), melanoma (93.2 percent) and female breast (90.8 percent).</p>
<p>&ldquo;While this report found that five-year survival for most types of cancer improved among both blacks and whites over the past several decades, racial disparities for many common cancers have persisted, and they may have increased for prostate cancer and female breast cancer,&rdquo; said Lynne T. Penberthy, M.D., M.P.H., associate director of NCI&rsquo;s Surveillance Research Program. &ldquo;We still have a lot of work to do to understand the causes of these differences, but certainly differences in the kinds and timing of recommended treatments are likely to play a role.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This report found that tobacco-related cancers have low survival rates, which underscores the importance of continuing to do what we know works to significantly reduce tobacco use,&rdquo; said Lisa C. Richardson, M.D., M.P.H., director of CDC&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. &ldquo;In addition, every state in the nation has an adult obesity prevalence of 20 percent or more. With obesity as a risk factor for cancer, we need to continue to support communities and families in prevention approaches that can help reverse the nation&rsquo;s obesity epidemic. We need to come together to create interventions aimed at increasing the uptake of recommended, effective cancer screening tests, and access to timely cancer care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The authors also stated that more attention and resources are needed to identify major risk factors for common cancers, such as colorectal, breast, and prostate, as are concerted efforts to understand the increasing incidence trends in uterine, female breast, and pancreatic cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The continued drops in overall cancer death rates in the United States are welcome news, reflecting improvements in prevention, early detection, and treatment,&rdquo; said Betsy A. Kohler, M.P.H., C.T.R., executive director of NAACCR. &ldquo;But this report also shows us that progress has been limited for several cancers, which should compel us to renew our commitment to efforts to discover new strategies for prevention, early detection, and treatment, and to apply proven interventions broadly and equitably.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A new study shows that the number of women in the United States living with distant metastatic breast cancer (MBC), the most severe form of the disease, is growing. This is likely due to the aging of the U.S. population and improvements in treatment. Researchers came to this finding by estimating the number of U.S. women living with MBC, or breast cancer that has spread to distant sites in the body, including women who were initially diagnosed with metastatic disease, and those who developed MBC after an initial diagnosis at an earlier stage.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that median and five-year relative survival for women initially diagnosed with MBC is improving, especially among younger women.</p>
<p>The study was led by Angela Mariotto, Ph.D., chief of the Data Analytics Branch of the Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), with coauthors from NCI, the Metastatic Breast Cancer Alliance, and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. The findings appeared online on May 18, 2017, in Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers &amp; Prevention. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>In documenting the prevalence of MBC, the findings point to the need for more research into how to address the health care needs of women who live with this condition. "Even though this group of patients with MBC is increasing in size, our findings are favorable," said Dr. Mariotto. "This is because, over time, these women are living longer with MBC. Longer survival with MBC means increased needs for services and research. Our study helps to document this need."</p>
<p>Although researchers have been able to estimate the number of women initially diagnosed with MBC, data on the number of women whose cancers spread to a distant organ site, either as a progression or a recurrence after being first diagnosed with an earlier stage of breast cancer, has been lacking because U.S. registries do not routinely collect or report data on recurrence. To develop a more accurate estimate of the total number of women living with MBC, researchers used data from NCI's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program to include women who developed MBC after diagnosis. The researchers estimated that, as of Jan. 1, 2017, more than 150,000 women in this country were living with MBC, and that 3 in 4 of them had initially been diagnosed with an earlier stage of breast cancer.</p>
<p>The study also shows that despite the poor prognosis of MBC, survival of women initially diagnosed with MBC has been increasing, especially among women diagnosed at younger ages. The researchers estimated that between 1992-1994 and 2005-2012, five-year relative survival among women initially diagnosed with MBC at ages 15-49 years doubled from 18 percent to 36 percent. Median relative survival time between 1992-1994 and 2005-2012 increased from 22.3 months to 38.7 months for women diagnosed between ages&nbsp;15-49, and from 19.1 months to 29.7 months for women diagnosed between ages 50-64. The researchers also reported that a small but meaningful number of women live many years after an initial diagnosis of MBC. More than 11 percent of women diagnosed between 2000-2004 under the age of 64 survived 10 years or more.</p>
<p>Based on their calculations, the researchers estimated that the number of women living with MBC increased by 4 percent from 1990 to 2000 and by 17 percent from 2000 to 2010, and they project that the number will increase by 31 percent from 2010 to 2020. Although the largest group of women with MBC consists of women who have been living with metastatic disease for two years or less (40 percent), one-third (34 percent) of women with MBC have lived for five years or more with the disease.</p>
<p>To estimate the number of U.S. women living with MBC, the researchers applied a back-calculation method to breast cancer mortality and survival data from the SEER Program. SEER collects clinical, demographic, and vital status information on all cancer cases diagnosed in defined geographic areas. The method they used assumes that a breast cancer death is preceded by MBC that was either found at diagnosis or after a recurrence with metastatic disease.</p>
<p>Collecting recurrence data has been challenging for cancer registries because recurrence can be diagnosed through diverse methods and in a variety of locations. To help implement the comprehensive and accurate collection of these data, NCI is funding pilot studies aimed at identifying ways to leverage existing data and informatics methods to efficiently capture information on recurrent disease.</p>
<p>By including women with recurrence, this study provides a more accurate number of women in the U.S. currently living with MBC. This estimation can help with health care planning and the ultimate goal of better serving these women.</p>
<p>"These findings make clear that the majority of MBC patients, those who are diagnosed with non-metastatic cancer but progress to distant disease, have never been properly documented," said Dr. Mariotto. "This study emphasizes the importance of collecting data on recurrence at the individual level in order to foster more research into the prevention of recurrence and the specific needs of this growing population."</p>

<p>Investigators with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network have identified molecular characteristics of a type of breast cancer, invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC), that distinguishes it from invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), the most common invasive breast cancer subtype. The new study—a comprehensive analysis of the genomes of 817 breast tumors—builds on the research network’s 2012 analysis of IDC, and provides the first in-depth analysis of the genetic drivers of ILC. Understanding the genomic differences between the two subtypes may enable clinicians to develop more personalized approaches to treating breast cancer.</p>

<p>ILC, which is the second most common subtype of invasive breast cancer, is defined by a lack of adhesiveness between cells, caused by ILC’s hallmark loss of the cell-cell adhesion protein E-cadherin. The new analysis confirmed the importance of the loss of E-cadherin function in ILC and identified differences between ILC and IDC in commonly mutated genes and Akt signaling activity, which affects cell growth. ILC tumors showed <i>FOXA1</i> gene mutations more frequently than IDC tumors, whereas mutations of the <i>GATA3</i> gene were more common in IDC. Both the <i>FOXA1</i> and <i>GATA3</i> proteins are key regulators of estrogen receptor function, suggesting that ILC tumors and IDC tumors may rely on different mechanisms to activate estrogen receptor-mediated gene expression programs. In addition, ILC tumors showed greater Akt signaling pathway activity than IDC tumors, and less expression of the tumor suppressor protein PTEN, suggesting that ILC tumors may be more sensitive to drugs that block the Akt pathway. The analysis further identified three subtypes of ILC—<i>reactive-like</i>, <i>immune-related</i>, and <i>proliferative</i>—that have distinct clinical outcomes, with the reactive-like subtype demonstrating the best outcome and the proliferative subtype the poorest. Finally, the researchers found that tumors that display components of both ILC and IDC were either ILC-like or IDC-like in their molecular features, and do not constitute a distinct subtype of invasive breast cancer. The findings were published October 8, 2015 in <i>Cell</i>. The National Cancer Institute and the National Human Genome Research Institute, both parts of the National Institutes of Health, jointly manage the TCGA program.</p>

<p>Today investigators at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the Children&rsquo;s Oncology Group (COG) announced the opening of enrollment for a unique precision medicine clinical trial. NCI-COG Pediatric Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (Pediatric MATCH) is a nationwide trial to explore whether targeted therapies can be effective for children and adolescents with solid tumors that harbor specific genetic mutations and have progressed during or after standard therapy. Pediatric MATCH will incorporate more than eight different study drugs, each targeting a predefined set of genetic mutations, to match patients with therapies aimed at the molecular abnormalities in their tumors. <br /><br />The study was developed and will be led jointly by NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, and COG, part of the NCI-sponsored National Clinical Trials Network. <br /><br />Pediatric MATCH is a phase 2 trial with sub-studies (arms) for each targeted drug being investigated. It will open with approximately six treatment arms, expanding to eight or more. A similar trial for adults, NCI-MATCH, began enrolling adult patients in August 2015 and is also matching patients to treatments based on the genetic mutations in their tumors. Pediatric MATCH is a separate trial for children and adolescents ages 1 to 21 who have solid tumors&mdash;including non-Hodgkin lymphomas, brain tumors, and histiocytoses&mdash;that no longer respond to standard treatment or have recurred after treatment.<br /><br />&ldquo;Pediatric MATCH is a very special trial,&rdquo; said Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., NCI acting director. &ldquo;There aren&rsquo;t any other cancer trials of this scale exploring targeted treatments for children whose cancers have specific genetic abnormalities. Precision medicine trials like Pediatric MATCH have the potential to accelerate progress in identifying more effective treatments for children with cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The trial has two enrollment steps. Each patient will initially enroll for a screening study, in which a sample of his or her relapsed tumor will undergo DNA and RNA sequencing to detect genetic abnormalities that could be targeted by one or more of the drugs being studied. Archived tumor samples can be used if they were obtained after the tumor progressed following initial treatment. If there is a genetic abnormality identified in the tumor and a drug in Pediatric MATCH that targets that abnormality, the patient can then enroll in the corresponding treatment arm if he or she meets the eligibility criteria. <br /><br />Pediatric MATCH will use a single sequencing test to screen for many molecular abnormalities at once. The test, which is also being used for the adult NCI-MATCH trial, was developed by the Molecular Characterization Laboratory at the NCI-sponsored Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) in Frederick, Maryland. The latest version of this test looks for alterations in more than 160 genes associated with cancer. <br /><br />To ensure quality control, biopsy specimens from all patients will be sent to a single location, the COG Biopathology Center at Nationwide Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, for DNA and RNA processing. The sequencing analysis for Pediatric MATCH will be done at two laboratories that carried out sequencing for adult NCI-MATCH: the FNLCR and&nbsp;MD Anderson Cancer Center.<br /><br />Cancer mutations that match one of the drugs being studied are expected to be found in only about 10 percent of tumors from children and adolescents with cancer. The trial investigators, therefore, project that they will screen 200 to 300 patients a year, for a total of 1,000 patients screened, to identify patients potentially eligible for each of the sub-studies. Patients with a matched drug will be able to receive treatment as long as their tumors remain stable in size or get smaller. At least 20 patients will be targeted for enrollment in each arm, and additional treatment arms will be added as the trial progresses. <br /><br />&ldquo;Pediatric MATCH is a cutting-edge trial in many ways,&rdquo; said COG chair Peter C. Adamson, M.D., of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital of Philadelphia. &ldquo;It will bring molecular analysis, coupled to a portfolio of new targeted agents, to children and adolescents with relapsed cancer across the United States. Importantly, it will also help us learn more about relapsed cancer in pediatric patients, catalyzing research aimed at developing better treatments.&rdquo;<br /><br />The drugs being used in Pediatric MATCH are all investigational (experimental) agents in children and contributed by pharmaceutical companies that have partnered with NCI to support this study. <br /><br />&ldquo;This trial would not have been possible without the enthusiastic support of the partnering pharmaceutical companies, as evidenced by their willingness to provide targeted agents for this trial,&rdquo; said NCI study co-chair Nita Seibel, M.D., of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. &ldquo;Some of the agents included have not previously been tested in children, so this trial will provide broader access to targeted agents for children and adolescents.&rdquo; <br /><br />Although most of the DNA mutations identified in study patients will be present only in cancer cells and not elsewhere in the body, some may have been inherited. For this reason, in Pediatric MATCH &ldquo;we will also look at whether mutations found in tumors are detected in blood samples and hence were inherited,&rdquo; said COG study co-chair Will Parsons, M.D., Ph.D., of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. &ldquo;This will allow us to provide the treating physician with guidance for the patient&rsquo;s family regarding the need for formal genetic testing, counseling, and follow-up care.&rdquo;<br /><br />Patients found not to have a matched drug may, with the help of their oncologists, be able to enroll in other studies available through the COG Developmental Therapeutics Program, Pediatric Brain Tumor Consortium, New Approaches to Neuroblastoma Therapy consortium, and pharmaceutical trials located through <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/about-cancer/treatment/clinical-trials/search">trials.cancer.gov</a>. <br /><br />Enrollment in Pediatric MATCH will be available at children&rsquo;s hospitals, university medical centers, and cancer centers across the United States that are part of COG. Sites will access the trial under the protocol identification <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03155620">APEC1621</a> via the NCI Cancer Trials Support Unit.</p>

<p>In a new study from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, researchers found a higher than expected&nbsp;prevalence of cancer at baseline screening in individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a rare inherited disorder that leads to a higher risk of developing certain cancers. The research demonstrates the feasibility of a new, comprehensive cancer screening protocol for this high-risk population.</p>
<p>The study was led by <a href="https://dceg.cancer.gov/about/staff-directory/biographies/O-Z/savage-sharon">Sharon A. Savage, M.D.</a>, of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG), and was published with a companion meta-analysis on August 3, 2017, in JAMA Oncology.</p>
<p>LFS is most often caused by germline, or hereditary, mutations in a tumor suppressor gene known as <em>TP53</em>. The disorder results in many kinds of cancers&mdash;including bone and soft-tissue cancers (sarcomas), breast cancer, brain tumors, and cancer of the adrenal gland&mdash;that frequently occur at young ages. Individuals with LFS have an approximately 50 percent chance of developing cancer by age 40, and up to a 90 percent chance by age 60. Many patients with LFS develop more than one primary cancer over their lifetimes.</p>
<p>Dr. Frederick Pei Li and Dr. Joseph F. Fraumeni, Jr., first described LFS at NCI in 1969. &ldquo;Researchers at the NCI have evaluated families with LFS extensively to better understand how germline mutations in <em>TP53</em> influence risk, and how best to prevent cancers or treat them at the earliest possible stage,&rdquo; said Dr. Fraumeni, Scientist Emeritus and Founding Director of DCEG. &ldquo;However, because of the broad spectrum of cancers in LFS families, it has been challenging to put in place universally accepted cancer strategies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To address this gap in clinical care, researchers modified a cancer surveillance protocol from a previously published study and screened 116 LFS patients with germline <em>TP53</em> mutations using a variety of tools including whole body, brain, and breast MRI, as well as mammography, colonoscopy, bloodwork, and abdominal ultrasound. The study used modalities that do not utilize ionizing radiation for imaging (except mammography), since patients with LFS appear to be radiosensitive.</p>
<p>They found that 40 trial participants (34 percent) had abnormalities on baseline screening examination with whole body, brain, or breast MRI that required further evaluation. Eight of these patients (7 percent) were diagnosed with a new primary cancer. All but one of the cancers found through screening were fully removed with surgery.&nbsp;In contrast, the&nbsp;non-MRI techniques used in the trial did not lead to a diagnosis of cancer at baseline screening.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For high-risk populations, like families with LFS, personalized prevention approaches like this are critical to the early detection of the many kinds of cancers seen in this group,&rdquo;&nbsp;Dr. Savage&nbsp;explained. &ldquo;This protocol, along with other published studies, offers patients with LFS a new road map for early cancer detection going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The meta-analysis, published in the same issue of the journal, involved 578 participants with LFS in 13 cohorts at multiple research centers around the world. Similarly utilizing rapid whole body MRI, the investigators had an overall detection rate of 7 percent for new primary cancers, confirming the results of the study conducted at NCI.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The findings from this international team effort further demonstrate the utility of whole body MRI screening for individuals with LFS,&rdquo; Dr. Savage said. &ldquo;With long term follow-up, additional refinement, and through international collaborations, we hope to establish a screening regimen that could extend and improve the lives of this unique population.&rdquo;</p>

<p>A new study identifies genes that are necessary in cancer cells for immunotherapy to work, addressing the problem of why some tumors don&rsquo;t respond to immunotherapy or respond initially but then stop as tumor cells develop resistance to immunotherapy.</p>
<p>The study, from the National Cancer Institute (NCI), was led by <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/node/853">Nicholas Restifo, M.D.</a>, a senior investigator with NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research, with coauthors from NCI; Georgetown University, Washington D.C.; the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts; New York University, New York City; and the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia. It was published online in Nature on August 7, 2017. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a great deal of interest in cancer immunotherapy, especially for patients who have metastatic cancer,&rdquo; said Dr. Restifo. &ldquo;The response to immunotherapy can be fantastic, but understanding why some patients don&rsquo;t respond will help us improve treatments for more patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cancer immunotherapy relies on T cells, a type of cell in the immune system, to destroy tumors. Dr. Restifo and his colleagues have previously shown that the infusion of large numbers of T cells can trigger complete regression of cancer in patients. They and others have also shown that T cells can directly recognize and kill tumor cells.</p>
<p>However, some tumor cells are resistant to the destruction unleashed by T cells. To investigate the basis for this resistance, the researchers sought to identify the genes in cancer cells that are necessary for them to be killed by T cells.</p>
<p>Working with a melanoma tumor cell line, the researchers used a gene editing technology called CRISPR that &ldquo;knocks out,&rdquo; or stops the expression, of individual genes in cancer cells. By knocking out every known protein-encoding gene in the human genome and then testing the ability of the gene-modified melanoma cells to respond to T cells, they found more than 100 genes that may play a role in facilitating tumor destruction by T cells.</p>
<p>Once the team identified these &ldquo;candidate&rdquo; genes, they sought additional evidence that these genes play a role in susceptibility to T cell-mediated killing. To this end, they examined data on &ldquo;cytolytic activity,&rdquo; or a genetic profile that shows cancer cells are responding to T cells, in more than 11,000 patient tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas, a collaboration between NCI and the National Human Genome Research Institute, also part of NIH. They found that a number of the genes identified in the CRISPR screen as being necessary for tumor cells to respond to T cells were indeed associated with tumor cytolytic activity in patient samples.</p>
<p>One such gene is called <em>APLNR</em>. The product of this gene is a protein called the apelin receptor. Although it had been suspected to contribute to the development of some cancers, this was the first indication of a role in the response to T cells. Further investigation of tumors from patients resistant to immunotherapies showed that the apelin receptor protein was nonfunctional in some of them, indicating that the loss of this protein may limit the response to immunotherapy treatment.</p>
<p>Shashank Patel, Ph.D., the first author of the study, said the results show that &ldquo;many more genes than we originally expected play a vital role in dictating the success of cancer immunotherapies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The researchers wrote that this gene list could serve as a blueprint to study the emergence of tumor resistance to T cell-based cancer therapies. Dr. Restifo noted that if this set of genes is validated in clinical trials, then this data could eventually lead to more effective treatments for patients.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If we can truly understand mechanisms of resistance to immunotherapy, we might be able to develop new therapeutics,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In fact, in the future, this knowledge could speed the development of a new category of drugs that can circumvent these escape mechanisms of tumor cells and help patients experience complete responses.&rdquo;</p>

Collins, M.D., Ph.D. &ldquo;Thanks to their extraordinary efforts, we have the potential to eliminate cervical cancer and greatly reduce other HPV-associated cancers. This award reinforces the critical importance of basic research in the development of medical breakthroughs like the HPV vaccine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Efforts to develop these vaccines were spurred by an urgent public health need. Infection with certain types of HPV causes almost all cases of cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide. More than 500,000 women around the world are diagnosed with cervical cancer each year, many of them at relatively young ages. More than 275,000 women die from the disease annually, and most of these deaths occur in developing regions of the world. Without successful interventions, the worldwide incidence and mortality from cervical cancer is projected to increase indefinitely. HPV infection also causes anal, vulvar, vaginal, penile, and oropharyngeal cancers.</p>
<p>While working to address the need to prevent HPV-caused cancers in the 1990s, a team led by Drs. Schiller and Lowy discovered that the proteins that form the outer shell of HPV could form virus-like particles (VLPs) that closely resemble the original virus but are not infectious. They found that these VLPs could trigger the immune system to produce high levels of protective antibodies that can neutralize the virus in a subsequent infection. The VLPs ultimately became the basis of the three current HPV vaccines: Gardasil, Gardasil 9, and Cervarix.</p>
<p>Drs. Lowy and Schiller say this breakthrough was possible because of earlier discoveries, and that it demonstrates the importance of long-term, publicly supported basic research.</p>
<p>&ldquo;People have known since the 19th century that cervical cancer behaved as a sexually transmitted disease, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the discoveries of Harald zur Hausen and his colleagues that HPV was found to be the cause. Development of the vaccines built upon decades of publicly supported research,&rdquo; said Dr. Lowy. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re honored to be included with the other luminaries who have received this prestigious award.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is estimated that widespread uptake of current HPV vaccines could reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer by more than two-thirds. Researchers are currently working to find ways to encourage uptake of the vaccines by lowering costs and simplifying the logistics of vaccination, especially in the developing world where most cervical cancers occur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s Lasker Medical Research Awards illustrate the power of biomedical investigation to advance human health, whether scientists probe basic questions that reveal unforeseen truths or pursue goal-directed projects,&rdquo; said Joseph L. Goldstein, M.D., chairman of the Department of Molecular Genetics at University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, and chair of the Lasker Medical Research Awards Jury. &ldquo;Douglas Lowy and John Schiller discovered that a single protein from the capsule of papillomaviruses can self-assemble into virus-like particles, paving the way for HPV vaccines that prevent cervical and other cancers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drs. Schiller and Lowy have co-authored more than 150 papers over the last 30 years, and have been recognized frequently for their work. They received the Federal Employee of the Year Service to America Medal from the Partnership for Public Service in 2007 and the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award from the Sabin Vaccine Institute in 2011. In November 2014, President Barack Obama presented them with the 2012 National Medal of Technology and Innovation.</p>
<p>Both researchers have noted how important it has been to their work to be part of the NCI intramural research program, where scientists can do long-term, high-risk research that has the potential to have a major impact on human health. The program also encourages collaboration with specialists in many different scientific areas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When we started this research, we didn&rsquo;t have a background in immunology or vaccinology, or clinical trials, so we greatly benefited from having access to scientific specialists who freely shared their expertise in these areas,&rdquo; Dr. Schiller said. &ldquo;These advances would not have happened without the many outstanding people we have worked with throughout the years.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Since 1945, the Lasker Awards have recognized outstanding contributions to basic and clinical medical research and public service. Eighty-seven Lasker Award recipients have won the Nobel Prize, and more than 40 have done so in the last three decades. This year&rsquo;s awards will be presented on September 15 in New York City.</p>

<p>The Tomosynthesis Mammographic Imaging Screening Trial (TMIST), the first randomized trial to compare two types of digital mammography for breast cancer screening, is now open for enrollment. The study was developed by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group (ECOG-ACRIN) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health. ECOG-ACRIN is leading the trial.</p>
<p>TMIST researchers are enrolling healthy women ages 45 to 74 who are already planning to get routine mammograms. By taking part in TMIST, the 165,000 planned participants will provide critical information that will help researchers learn how to most effectively screen women for breast cancer and help women make informed decisions about the screening tests in the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nearly 50 million screening mammograms occur each year in the United States, yet it has been decades since a large-scale randomized trial of mammography has been done,&rdquo; said Worta McCaskill-Stevens, M.D., director of the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP), the NCI program supporting the trial. &ldquo;The evolution of mammography technology provides us with an opportunity to fill in the gaps in our knowledge about two available breast cancer screening tests.&rdquo;</p>
<p>TMIST is comparing two types of digital mammography approved by the Food and Drug Administration: tomosynthesis (known as three-dimensional, or 3-D) and conventional (two-dimensional, or 2-D). Although 3-D mammography, being the newer technology, is likely to detect more findings that require follow-up, it is also likely to lead to more procedures and treatments. It is not known if this newer mammography technology is reducing a woman&rsquo;s risk of developing a life-threatening (advanced) cancer compared with 2-D mammography. The TMIST trial aims to find out.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We need to determine if 3-D mammography is better than 2-D at finding the sort of breast cancers that are most likely to spread and kill women,&rdquo; said ECOG-ACRIN study chair Etta D. Pisano, M.D., vice chair of research in the Department of Radiology at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and professor in residence of radiology at Harvard Medical School, Boston. &ldquo;If a newer screening technology does not reduce the numbers of advanced, life-threatening cancers, then are we really improving screening for breast cancer?&rdquo;</p>
<p>TMIST researchers are collecting data on the results of every mammogram, whether the imaging shows no signs of cancer, findings suspicious of cancer, or a breast cancer. Any medical follow-ups, such as more imaging or biopsies, are also being reported. TMIST researchers intend to follow all participants for breast cancer status, treatment, and outcomes from the time of randomization until the end of the study (at least 2025).</p>
<p>Based on the findings of earlier studies, researchers know that the vast majority of women in the study will not develop breast cancer. If a woman does receive a diagnosis of any kind of breast cancer while in the trial, she will receive treatment just as she would if she was not part of TMIST, while continuing to be part of the trial.</p>
<p>In addition to data from mammograms, the trial is building a biorepository for future research on genetic markers for breast cancer by asking all participants to voluntarily submit blood samples and swabs of cells from inside the mouth (buccal cells). This data could, in the future, help women and their doctors decide the best ways to screen for breast cancer by evaluating their individual risk factors for developing the disease. TMIST researchers are also analyzing tissue collected from women who have biopsies during the trial because of mammogram findings that require follow-up. This is to learn more about the biology of breast cancers detected through screening.</p>
<p>About 100 mammography clinics in the United States are planning to participate in the trial and are opening on a rolling basis over the next several months. Women are being told about the opportunity to enroll in the trial when they schedule a routine mammogram. Once enrolled, they will be assigned to either 2-D or 3-D mammography screening. Most women enrolled in the trial will be screened annually. Postmenopausal women with no high-risk factors will be screened every two years.</p>
<p>To ensure a diverse group of participants, sites are well represented both geographically and by the race/ethnicity of the women the sites serve. Several Canadian clinics are joining the trial, having already enrolled more than 3,000 women in a smaller lead-in study that is helping to inform TMIST.</p>

<p>The 2018 Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi Prize for Progress in Cancer Research will be awarded to Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., and John T. Schiller, Ph.D., of the Center for Cancer Research at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), one of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). They are being recognized for their contributions toward the development of vaccines for the human papillomavirus (HPV).</p>
<p>Drs. Schiller and Lowy &ldquo;have made monumental impacts in the field of cancer sciences and could not be more deserving of this award,&rdquo; said Sujuan Ba, Ph.D., co-chair of the 2018 prize selection committee and president of the National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR), which awards the annual prize.</p>
<p>Dr. Lowy, who is also deputy director of NCI, and Dr. Schiller have co-authored more than 150 papers over the last 30 years. Most notably, their work to understand and prevent HPV infection has led to the approval of three preventive HPV vaccines by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). HPV infection causes almost all cases of cervical cancer, the fourth most common cancer in women worldwide, as well as several other cancers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We at NCI are very proud to see Dr. Lowy and Dr. Schiller awarded this prestigious prize for their important work in cancer research,&rdquo; said NCI Director Ned Sharpless, M.D. &ldquo;Their receipt of the Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi Prize for their extraordinary research recognizes how important discoveries come from building on earlier work, and how those efforts can lead to major breakthroughs in public health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Every year, more than 500,000 women around the world are diagnosed with cervical cancer and more than 275,000 women die from the disease. HPV infection also causes other types of cancer, including about 70 percent of oropharyngeal cancers in the U.S., about 95 percent of anal cancers, and many cases of vulvar, vaginal, and penile cancer.</p>
<p>In the 1990s, a team led by Drs. Schiller and Lowy discovered that proteins that form the outer shell of HPV can assemble into noninfectious virus-like particles (VLPs). They found that VLPs could trigger the immune system to produce high levels of protective antibodies. The VLPs became the basis of three FDA-approved vaccines: Gardasil, Gardasil 9, and Cervarix.</p>
<p>Drs. Lowy and Schiller attribute their breakthrough to building on earlier scientific findings and say it demonstrates the importance of basic research.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are greatly honored by this award, and to be included with the exceptional group of scientists who have also received it,&rdquo; said Dr. Lowy. &ldquo;Our work that it recognizes is indebted to decades of publicly supported research, as well as to the culture of collaboration in the NIH Intramural Research Program that allowed us to learn from experts across many different disciplines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Continued research into HPV includes finding ways to encourage vaccination by lowering costs and simplifying the process, especially in the developing world. It has been estimated that widespread uptake of current HPV vaccines could reduce the incidence and mortality of cervical cancer by more than two-thirds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are especially pleased to be recognized with this award because it highlights the great importance of research into cancer prevention,&rdquo; said Dr. Schiller. &ldquo;These vaccines have the potential to cause HPV infection to go from common to uncommon, and the ability to eliminate cervical cancer and other HPV-associated cancers as major worldwide health problems.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Drs. Schiller and Lowy have been frequently honored for their work. In September 2017, they received the Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, the nation&rsquo;s most prestigious biomedical research prize, for their HPV research. They received the Federal Employee of the Year Service to America Medal from the Partnership for Public Service in 2007 and the Albert B. Sabin Gold Medal Award from the Sabin Vaccine Institute in 2011. They were presented with the 2012 National Medal of Technology and Innovation by President Barack Obama in November 2014.</p>
<p>NFCR established the Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi Prize in 2006 in honor of its cofounder, Albert Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi, M.D., Ph.D., who received the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his study of vitamin C and cell respiration. According to NFCR, the annual prize honors scientists &ldquo;who have made an original discovery or breakthrough in scientific understanding that has had a lasting impact on the cancer field and a direct impact on saving people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo; The award highlights the essential role basic research plays in understanding cancer.</p>
<p>The prize will be presented at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., on May 5, 2018.</p>

<p>Interim results from a randomized clinical trial for patients with desmoid tumors or aggressive fibromatosis (DT/DF) show that the drug sorafenib tosylate (Nexavar) extended progression-free survival compared with a placebo. Progression-free survival is the length of time patients lived before their disease worsened. Based on these interim results, the data and safety monitoring board overseeing the trial recommended that the primary results of the study be released.</p>
<p>The trial was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH); designed and conducted by researchers with the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology (Alliance); and supported by Bayer HealthCare AG, which provided the study drug.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sorafenib is a novel way of treating this rare cancer,&rdquo; said lead investigator and study chair Mrinal M. Gounder, M.D., sarcoma medical oncologist at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. &ldquo;The promising results of this phase 3 trial represent a paradigm shift in the approach to treatment of patients with desmoid tumors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DT/DF are rare sarcomas estimated to occur in approximately 1,000 people each year in the United States, many of them relatively young. The sarcomas usually arise in the extremities or the abdomen and occasionally are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis or Gardner Syndrome. DT/DF are locally aggressive and can result in pain and decreased mobility, and they can invade vital organs or structures resulting in bowel obstructions and other serious complications.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Currently, there is no standard treatment for this rare disease, and the effectiveness of the treatments that are used for it&mdash;for example, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy&mdash;is generally limited,&rdquo; said Jeff Abrams, M.D., clinical director of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis. &ldquo;But the interim results of this trial are promising and may offer a new treatment alternative.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Sorafenib is a targeted treatment, given in pill form, that interferes with the growth of cancer cells and new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. It is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of some patients with advanced kidney, liver, and thyroid cancer. The drug was chosen for this trial because in earlier retrospective studies of patients treated with sorafenib, desmoid tumors shrank, and patients had a reduction in pain and other symptoms.</p>
<p>The phase 3 double-blind clinical trial, designated as A091105, enrolled 87 patients with DT/DF between March 2014 and December 2016. To be eligible, patients had to have disease that could not be removed surgically, that had grown, or that was causing symptoms and met specific criteria. Patients were randomly assigned to one of two treatment arms: one group received sorafenib (400 mg/day), and the other received a matched placebo. Patients in both groups continued treatment until their tumors grew or they experienced adverse events from treatment. Patients whose tumors progressed while in the study were informed of their treatment assignment, and those who had been receiving a placebo were allowed to receive sorafenib.</p>
<p>The primary endpoint was progression-free survival.&nbsp;The trial was designed to target an improvement in median progression-free survival from six months for placebo to 15 months for sorafenib.&nbsp;Based on an interim analysis of the first 75 patients enrolled, the observed improvement in progression-free survival exceeded the trial-design target.</p>
<p>Patients who received sorafenib were more likely to experience drug-related adverse events than those who received placebo. However, these side effects&mdash;which included fatigue, rash, gastrointestinal complications, infection, and hypertension&mdash;were generally not severe.</p>
<p>Full details from this study will be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting and in a peer-reviewed publication.</p>
<p>Alliance is one of four adult network groups in the NCI National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). Bayer, the drug&rsquo;s manufacturer, provided sorafenib for the trial and supported this study under a Clinical Trials Agreement with NCI for the clinical development of sorafenib.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This trial would not have been done without a large national network of investigators brought together through the NCI-supported NCTN program that was capable of enrolling patients with this very rare cancer,&rdquo; said Dr. Abrams.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The success of this study shows how a partnership between Alliance, NCI, and Bayer HealthCare AG was able to provide the infrastructure and scientific knowledge to conduct a transformative trial in this rare tumor in patients across the United States and Canada,&rdquo; added Gary K.

<p>Researchers funded by the National Institutes of Health have completed a detailed genomic analysis, known as the PanCancer Atlas, on a data set of molecular and clinical information from over 10,000 tumors representing 33 types of cancer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project is the culmination of more than a decade of groundbreaking work,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. &ldquo;This analysis provides cancer researchers with unprecedented understanding of how, where, and why tumors arise in humans, enabling better-informed clinical trials and future treatments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The PanCancer Atlas, published as a collection of 27 papers across a suite of <em>Cell</em> journals, sums up the work accomplished by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) &ndash; a multi-institution collaboration initiated and supported by the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI) and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), both part of NIH. The program, with over $300 million in total funding, involved upwards of 150 researchers at more than two dozen institutions across North America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;TCGA was the first project of its scale to characterize &ndash; at the molecular level &ndash; cancer across a breadth of cancer types,&rdquo; said Carolyn Hutter, Ph.D., director of NHGRI&rsquo;s Division of Genome Sciences and the NHGRI team lead for TCGA. &ldquo;At the project&rsquo;s infancy 10 years ago, it wasn&rsquo;t even possible, much less on such a scale, to do the types of characterization and analysis that were being proposed. It was a hugely ambitious project.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The PanCancer Atlas effort complements the <a href="https://cancergenome.nih.gov/publications">over 30 tumor-specific papers</a> that have been published by TCGA in the last decade and expands upon earlier pan-cancer work that was <a href="https://www.nature.com/tcga/">published in 2013</a>,&rdquo; said Jean Claude Zenklusen, Ph.D., director of the TCGA Program Office at NCI.</p>
<p>The project focused not only on cancer genome sequencing, but also on different types of data analyses, such as investigating gene and protein expression profiles, and associating them with clinical and imaging data.</p>
<p>The PanCancer Atlas is divided into three main categories, each anchored by a summary paper that recaps the core findings for the topic. The main topics include cell of origin, oncogenic processes, and oncogenic pathways. Multiple companion papers report in-depth explorations of individual topics within these categories.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the first summary paper, the authors summarize the findings from a set of analyses that used a technique called molecular clustering, which groups tumors by parameters such as genes being expressed, abnormality of chromosome numbers in tumor cells, and DNA modifications. The paper&rsquo;s findings suggest that tumor types cluster by their possible cells of origin, a result that adds to our understanding of how tumor tissue of origin influences a cancer&rsquo;s features and could lead to more specific treatments for various cancer types.</p>
<p>The second summary paper presents a broad view of the TCGA findings on the processes that lead to cancer development and progression. Specifically, the authors noted that the findings identified three critical oncogenic processes: mutations, both germline (inherited) and somatic (acquired); the influence of the tumor&rsquo;s underlying genome and epigenome on gene and protein expression; and the interplay of tumor and immune cells. These findings will help prioritize the development of new treatments and immunotherapies for a wide range of cancers.</p>
<p>The final summary paper details TCGA investigations on the genomic alterations in the signaling pathways that control cell cycle progression, cell death, and cell growth, revealing the similarities and differences in these processes across a range of cancers. Their findings reveal new patterns of cancer&rsquo;s potential vulnerabilities that will aid in the development of combination therapies and personalized medicine.</p>
<p>The entire collection of papers comprising the PanCancer Atlas are available through a <a href="http://www.cell.com/pb-assets/consortium/PanCancerAtlas/PanCani3/index.html ">portal on cell.com</a>. Additionally, as the decade-long TCGA effort wraps up, there will be a three-day symposium, <a href="http://www.cell-symposia.com/tcga-2018/">TCGA Legacy: Multi-Omic Studies in Cancer</a>, in Washington, D.C., September 27-29, 2018, that will discuss the future of large-scale cancer studies, with a session focusing on the PanCancer Atlas. The meeting will feature the latest advances on the genomic architecture of cancer and showcase recent progress toward therapeutic targeting.<br /><br /></p>

<p>In a new study, researchers identified genetic subtypes of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) that could help explain why some patients with the disease respond to treatment and others don&rsquo;t. The study, led by researchers in the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, with additional authors from several institutions around the world, was published online April 11, 2018, in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These findings are the culmination of two decades of research at NCI and elsewhere, advancing our understanding of the effect of DNA mutations and gene expression on lymphoma biology and outcome,&rdquo; said <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=75&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=734&amp;sys_contentid=922213" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="6935791" sys_dependentvariantid="734" sys_dependentid="922213" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305">NCI Director Ned Sharpless, M.D.</a> &ldquo;This refined molecular classification will be instrumental in predicting prognosis and tailoring therapy for patients with DLBCL going forward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>DLBCL is the most common type of <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=55&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=814&amp;sys_contentid=14778" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_relationshipid="6935792" sys_dependentvariantid="814" sys_dependentid="14778" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305">lymphoma</a>. Although it can be aggressive, it is potentially curable, and in some patients treatment eliminates the disease. However, researchers still don&rsquo;t have a full understanding of why some lymphomas of this type respond to treatment and others don&rsquo;t. The standard treatment for the disease is a combination of chemotherapy drugs plus rituximab, a drug known as a monoclonal antibody.</p>
<p>Several years ago, researchers defined two major subgroups of DLBCL that arise from different cells of origin and that have different patterns of gene activity. They found that patients with activated B-cell-like (ABC) DLBCL have about a 40 percent average survival rate, while those with germinal center B-cell-like (GCB) DLBCL have about a 75 percent average survival rate. But even in the GCB subgroup, many patients experience disease relapse after treatment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first question we wanted to tackle was whether there were other molecular features of the tumors that could help us explain why some people were well-served by chemotherapy,&rdquo; explained <a href="https://ccr.cancer.gov/lymphoid-malignancies-branch/louis-m-staudt">Louis M. Staudt, M.D., Ph.D.</a>, of NCI&rsquo;s CCR, who led the new study. &ldquo;And the second, related question was, if we could understand who was not responding well to treatment, could we understand the genetics of these tumors to suggest new potential therapies beyond chemotherapy? The answer to both questions was &lsquo;yes.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The investigators performed a multi-platform analysis of genomic alterations and gene expression on tumor samples from 574 patients with DLBCL. This analysis identified four prominent genetic subtypes that each share a group of genetic aberrations. Patients with two of the subtypes, called BN2 and EZB, respond well to treatment, while those with the other two, MCD and N1, do not. Some of these subtypes can be found in both ABC and GCB subgroups, so a patient could, for example, have ABC DLBCL, the gene expression profile with the lower survival rate, but the disease could also have the BN2 genetic subtype that responds well to chemotherapy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This shows we&rsquo;ve gone beyond where we were,&rdquo; said Dr. Staudt. &ldquo;Before, even with our most advanced molecular diagnosis, we would have said all ABC tumors are the &lsquo;bad&rsquo; type and they need to be treated aggressively. Now we can implement this kind of classification and say that even if a patient has the &lsquo;bad&rsquo; ABC type, they have the &lsquo;good&rsquo; genetic type, BN2. So there&rsquo;s a much better chance of chemotherapy curing the disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Data from the study will be shared through NCI&rsquo;s <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/">Genomic Data Commons</a> to make it available for future research.</p>
<p>While the new findings relate to current treatment, Dr. Staudt said he and his colleagues hope the new molecular classification will be used in clinical trials, so, eventually, treatments can move away from chemotherapy as much as possible, toward more targeted therapies that have fewer side effects.</p>
<p>Research is already being done in this area. Results of a phase 2 clinical trial published in 2015, for example, demonstrated that patients with ABC DLBCL were more likely to respond to the targeted therapy drug ibrutinib than those with GCB DLBCL.</p>
<p>Precision medicine clinical trials could test tumors for the new genetic subtypes, Dr. Staudt explained, and then, based on the tumor&rsquo;s classification, the patient would be assigned to the most appropriate treatment arm of the study.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal is to find the right drug for the right person at the right time,&rdquo; said Dr. Staudt. &ldquo;And we feel this genetic understanding of diffuse lymphoma is a step forward in precision therapy.&rdquo;<br /><br /></p>

A companion study reports on recent changes in prostate cancer trends." field_feature_card_description="Study reports overall cancer incidence and mortality, prostate cancer trends." field_search_engine_restrictions="IncludeSearch" field_date_posted="2018-05-22" field_date_reviewed="2018-05-17" field_pretty_url="annual-report-nation-2018" field_public_use="1" press_release_type="NCI Press Release"><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>The latest Annual Report to the Nation on the Status of Cancer finds that overall cancer death rates continue to decline in men, women, and children in the United States in all major racial and ethnic groups. Overall cancer incidence, or rates of new cancers, decreased in men and were stable in women from 1999 to 2014. In a companion study, researchers reported that there has been an increase in incidence of late-stage prostate cancer and that after decades of decline, prostate cancer mortality has stabilized.</p>
<p>The annual report is a collaborative effort between the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health; the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC); the American Cancer Society; and the North American Association of Central Cancer Registries (NAACCR). The studies appeared online in <em>Cancer</em> on May 22, 2018.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This year&rsquo;s report is an encouraging indicator of progress we&rsquo;re making in cancer research. As overall death rates continue to decline for all major racial and ethnic groups in the United States, it&rsquo;s clear that interventions are having an impact,&rdquo; said NCI Director Ned Sharpless, M.D. &ldquo;The report also highlights areas where more work is needed. With steadfast commitment to patients and their families, we will be able to lower the mortality rates faster and improve the lives of those affected by cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report includes mortality data through 2015. It shows that, from 1999 to 2015, overall cancer death rates decreased by 1.8 percent per year among men and by 1.4 percent per year among women. From 2011 to 2015, death rates decreased for 11 of the 18 most common cancer types in men and for 14 of the 20 most common cancer types in women. Over the same period, death rates for cancers of the liver, pancreas, and brain and other nervous system increased in both men and women; death rates for cancer of the uterus increased in women; and death rates for cancers of the oral cavity and pharynx and soft tissue increased in men. From 2010 to 2014, incidence rates decreased for 7 of the 17 most common cancer types among men and for 7 of the 18 most common cancer types among women.</p>
<p>In the companion study, researchers explored prostate cancer trends in more detail. They found that overall prostate cancer incidence rates declined an average of 6.5 percent each year between 2007 and 2014, from a rate of 163 new cases per 100,000 men in the population in 2007 to 104 new cases per 100,000 in 2014. However, incidence of distant disease&mdash;that is, of cancer that has spread from the original tumor to other parts of the body&mdash;increased from a low rate of 7.8 new cases per 100,000 in 2010 to 9.2 new cases per 100,000 in 2014. Furthermore, after two decades of decline between 1993 and 2013, prostate cancer mortality leveled off between 2013 and 2015. Although rates of distant disease increased in recent years, there was no increase in the rates of cases with aggressive histologic grade (Gleason score of 9-10).</p>
<p>This study also reports a decline in recent prostate-specific antigen (PSA) screening in the population based on a series of national surveys. The reported decline in screening occurred between the 2010 and 2013 surveys, for men between 50 and 74 years of age, and after the 2008 survey, for men age 75 and older.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The increase in late-stage disease and the flattening of the mortality trend occurred contemporaneously with the observed decrease in PSA screening in the population,&rdquo; said Serban Negoita, M.D., Dr.P.H., of NCI&rsquo;s Surveillance Research Program and lead author of the prostate cancer report. &ldquo;Although suggestive, this observation does not demonstrate that one caused the other, as there are many factors that contribute to incidence and mortality, such as improvements in staging and treating cancer. Additional research is needed to get a more comprehensive understanding of the recent trends and the&nbsp;possible&nbsp;relationship with PSA screening, as well as the relationship with other factors that may be associated with these trends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Findings in the first part of the report show that incidence and death rates for all types of cancer combined were higher in men than in women in every racial and ethnic group. For all cancer sites combined, black men and white women had the highest incidence rates compared to other racial groups, and black men and black women had the highest death rates compared to other racial groups. Non-Hispanic men and women had higher incidence and death rates than those of Hispanic ethnicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There continue to be significant declines in the cancer death rate with significant differences in rate by sex, race, and ethnicity,&rdquo; said Otis W. Brawley, M.D., chief medical officer for ACS. &ldquo;We need to continue working to understand the reasons for the disparities and how to most efficiently continue supporting and, if possible, accelerate these declines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The report also describes five-year survival during 2007-2013 by cancer stage at diagnosis for four of the most common cancers&mdash;female breast cancer, colorectal cancer, lung and bronchus cancer, and melanoma of the skin. While five-year survival is high for early-stage disease for breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and melanoma, survival remains low for all stages of lung cancer, ranging from 55 percent for Stage I to 4 percent for Stage IV.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This report underscores that if cancer is caught early, when it has the best chance of being treated, patients can live longer,&rdquo; said CDC Director Robert R. Redfield, M.D. &ldquo;Early detection and timely, quality treatment are keys to saving lives.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&nbsp;Increases in death rates for several cancers continue to cause concern. Researchers suggest that the increase in liver cancer death rates is related to the high prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection among Baby Boomers, as well as to the high prevalence of obesity in the United States. Obesity is also thought to have contributed to the increase in death rates from cancers of the uterus and pancreas. The recent increase in oral cavity and pharynx cancer death rates among white men is thought to be associated with human papillomavirus infection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s encouraging to see progress in decreasing death rates for many types of cancer,&rdquo; said Betsy A. Kohler, executive director, NAACCR. &ldquo;Yet the fact that death rates from several cancers are still on the rise means we need to keep working to find strategies to encourage prevention and continue to make improvements in screening and treatment.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Scientists have found a connection between bacteria in the gut and antitumor immune responses in the liver. Their study, published online May 24 in <em>Science</em>, was led by researchers in the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI). It showed that bacteria found in the gut of mice affect the liver&rsquo;s antitumor immune function. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms that lead to liver cancer and for therapeutic approaches to treat them. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What we found using different tumor models is that if you treat mice with antibiotics and thereby deplete certain bacteria, you can change the composition of immune cells of the liver, affecting tumor growth in the liver,&rdquo; said Tim Greten, M.D., of NCI&rsquo;s CCR, who led the study. &ldquo;This is a great example of how what we learn from basic research can give us insight into cancer and possible treatments.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The microbiome is the collection of bacteria and other microorganisms that live in or on the body. In humans, the greatest proportion of the body&rsquo;s total microbiome is in the gut. Despite extensive research into the relationship between the gut microbiome and cancer, the role of gut bacteria in the formation of liver cancer has remained poorly understood.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To investigate whether gut bacteria affect the development of tumors in the liver, Dr. Greten and his team carried out a series of experiments with mice. They used three mouse models of liver cancer, and found that when they depleted gut bacteria using an antibiotic &ldquo;cocktail,&rdquo; the mice that had the antibiotics developed fewer and smaller liver tumors and had reduced metastasis to the liver.</p>
<p>The investigators next studied the immune cells in the liver to understand how the depletion of gut bacteria suppressed tumor growth in the liver of the antibiotic-treated mice. Antibiotic treatment increased the numbers of a type of immune cell called NKT cells in the livers of the mice. Further experiments showed that, in all three mouse models, the reduction in liver tumor growth that resulted from antibiotic treatment was dependent on these NKT cells. Next, they found that the accumulation of the NKT cells in the liver resulted from an increase in the expression of a protein called CXCL16 on cells that line the inside of capillaries in the liver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We asked ourselves, why do mice treated with antibiotics have more CXCL16 production in these endothelial cells?&rdquo; Dr. Greten said. &ldquo;That was the critical point, when we found that bile acids can control the expression of CXCL16. We then did further studies, and found that if we treat mice with bile acids, we can actually change the number of NKT cells in the liver, and thereby the number of tumors in the liver.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Bile acids are formed in the liver and help break down fats during digestion.</p>
<p>Finally, the investigators found that one bacterial species, <em>Clostridium scindens</em>, controls metabolism of bile acids in the mouse gut&mdash;and ultimately CXCL16 expression, NKT cell accumulation, and tumor growth in the liver.</p>
<p>Dr. Greten explained that while many studies have shown an association between gut bacteria and immune response, this study is significant in that it identifies not just a correlation, but a complete mechanism of how bacteria affect the immune response in liver. In the same study, the researchers found that bile acids also control the expression of the CXCL16 protein in the liver of humans and wrote that, though these results are preliminary, the novel mechanism described in this study could potentially apply to cancer patients.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A novel approach to immunotherapy developed by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) has led to the complete regression of breast cancer in a patient who was unresponsive to all other treatments. This patient received the treatment in a clinical trial led by Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Surgery Branch at NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research (CCR), and the findings were published June 4, 2018 in <em>Nature Medicine</em>. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve developed a high-throughput method to identify mutations present in a cancer that are recognized by the immune system,&rdquo; Dr. Rosenberg said. &ldquo;This research is experimental right now. But because this new approach to immunotherapy is dependent on mutations, not on cancer type, it is in a sense a blueprint we can use for the treatment of many types of cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new immunotherapy approach is a modified form of adoptive cell transfer (ACT). ACT has been effective in treating melanoma, which has high levels of somatic, or acquired, mutations. However, it has been less effective with some common epithelial cancers, or cancers that start in the lining of organs, that have lower levels of mutations, such as stomach, esophageal, ovarian, and breast cancers.</p>
<p>In an ongoing phase 2 clinical trial, the investigators are developing a form of ACT that uses tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that specifically target tumor cell mutations to see if they can shrink tumors in patients with these common epithelial cancers. As with other forms of ACT, the selected TILs are grown to large numbers in the laboratory and are then infused back into the patient (who has in the meantime undergone treatment to deplete remaining lymphocytes) to create a stronger immune response against the tumor.</p>
<p>A patient with metastatic breast cancer came to the trial after receiving multiple treatments, including several chemotherapy and hormonal treatments, that had not stopped her cancer from progressing. To treat her, the researchers sequenced DNA and RNA from one of her tumors, as well as normal tissue to see which mutations were unique to her cancer, and identified 62 different mutations in her tumor cells.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The researchers then tested different TILs from the patient to find those that recognized one or more of these mutated proteins. TILs recognized four of the mutant proteins, and the TILs then were expanded and infused back into the patient. She was also given the checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab to prevent the possible inactivation of the infused T cells by factors in the tumor microenvironment. After the treatment, all of this patient&rsquo;s cancer disappeared and has not returned more than 22 months later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is an illustrative case report that highlights, once again, the power of immunotherapy,&rdquo; said Tom Misteli, Ph.D., director of CCR at NCI. &ldquo;If confirmed in a larger study, it promises to further extend the reach of this T-cell therapy to a broader spectrum of cancers.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Investigators have seen similar results using mutation-targeted TIL treatment for patients in the same trial with other epithelial cancers, including <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24812403">liver cancer</a> and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27959684">colorectal cancer</a>. Dr. Rosenberg explained that results like this in patients with solid epithelial tumors are important because ACT has not been as successful with these kinds of cancers as with other types that have more mutations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>He said the &ldquo;big picture&rdquo; here is this kind of treatment is not cancer-type specific. &ldquo;All cancers have mutations, and that&rsquo;s what we&rsquo;re attacking with this immunotherapy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It is ironic that the very mutations that cause the cancer may prove to be the best targets to treat the cancer.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The research team includes Nikolaos Zacharakis, Ph.D.; Steven A. Feldman, Ph.D.; and Stephanie L. Goff, M.D.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute's Molecular Analysis for Therapy Choice (NCI-MATCH) trial, the largest precision medicine trial of its kind, has achieved a milestone with the release of results from several treatment arms, or sub-studies, of the trial. The new results offer findings of interest for future cancer research that could ultimately play a role in bringing targeted treatments to patients with certain gene abnormalities, regardless of their cancer type.</p>
<p>Findings from three arms were released at this year's American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago, adding to <a href="https://jitc.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40425-017-0297-3">findings from one arm released in November 2017</a>. The study was co-developed by NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health, and the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, part of the NCI-sponsored National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN). ECOG-ACRIN and NCI are co-leading the trial.</p>
<p>"The outcomes data being released today from this groundbreaking precision medicine trial are an exciting step for NCI-MATCH," said Lyndsay Harris, M.D., of NCI's&nbsp;Cancer Diagnosis Program and NCI study chair. "These findings represent a large collection of data in populations of patients who may not have been studied in conventional clinical trials, and they will have important implications for future precision medicine trials."</p>
<p>NCI-MATCH, a phase 2 clinical trial, seeks to determine whether targeted therapies for people whose tumors have certain gene mutations will be effective regardless of their cancer type. Researchers use a DNA sequencing test to identify gene mutations in patients&rsquo; tumors. The test looks for mutations in 143 genes associated with cancer that can be targeted by one of the drugs being studied in the trial. The trial launched in August 2015 and has nearly 40 treatment arms, each of which aims to enroll at least 35 patients whose tumors have a specific genetic change. As the first findings are released at ASCO, many other arms are still enrolling patients and several additional arms are in development for possible opening later in 2018.</p>
<p>"NCI-MATCH represents the first attempt to systematically leverage next-generation sequencing to explore so many therapies in parallel," said ECOG-ACRIN study chair Keith T. Flaherty, M.D., a medical oncologist at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston. "By focusing our investigational effort on new biomarker-guided therapies in understudied cancer types, we have accelerated the opportunity to find signals of efficacy."</p>
<p>The study is a signal-finding trial, meaning that treatments that show promise can advance to larger, more definitive studies outside of the trial. NCI-MATCH is for adults who have solid tumors, lymphoma, or myeloma that have progressed on standard treatment or rare cancers for which there is no standard treatment. A goal of the study was for about 25 percent of patients in the trial to have rare cancers. Surprisingly, 62.5 percent of the first 6,000 patients enrolled in NCI-MATCH had tumors other than the four most common cancers (breast, colorectal, non-small cell lung, and prostate), providing more opportunities for less common and rare tumors than expected based on initial estimates.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first arm for which results were released (Arm Z1D), in November 2017 at the Society for Immunotherapy of Cancer annual meeting, showed that the drug nivolumab has promising activity in mismatch repair&ndash;deficient non-colorectal cancers.</p>
<p>Highlights from the findings from the three arms announced at ASCO include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arm I studied the drug taselisib in 65 patients with mutations in the <em>PIK3CA</em> gene. There were no objective responses to the drug, meaning the tumors did not shrink substantially. However, 24 percent of the patients had progression-free survival&mdash;or prolonged stable disease&mdash;of greater than six months. This prolonged stable disease was seen even in patients with aggressive cancer types, including lung cancer and cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct) cancer. The observation of prolonged disease control in these cancer types suggests the drug warrants further research.</li>
<li>In Arm Q, the drug ado-trastuzumab emtansine (T-DM1) was studied in patients with HER2-overexpressing tumors, excluding breast and gastric/gastroesophageal junction cancers. Partial responses (at least 30 percent shrinkage of the tumor) were seen in three of the 37 patients, each of whom had a rare cancer: mucoepidermoid carcinoma of the parotid gland, squamous cell cancer of the parotid gland, and extramammary Paget disease of the scrotum. In addition, 46 percent of the patients had stable disease, including patients with ovarian, uterine, and colorectal cancers. The researchers concluded that the findings warrant further study, particularly in certain rare cancers.</li>
<li>Arm W tested the drug AZD4547 in 50 patients with mutations in the FGFR pathway. Ten percent of patients had a partial response. Among four patients who had a partial response, whose tumors all had different sites of origin, two had point mutations in the <em>FGFR2/3</em> gene and the other two had <em>FGFR3</em> gene fusions, in which part of the <em>FGFR</em> gene is joined to part of another gene. This suggests that these mutations may be particularly sensitive to the drug, warranting further studies in tumors harboring these fusions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of the patients in these three arms had been treated with more than three lines of therapy before entering the trial (Arm I: 37 percent, Arm Q: 33 percent, Arm W: 50 percent), so the results are particularly encouraging. It suggests that future studies in populations with earlier-stage disease could potentially see more responses.</p>
<p>Results of additional treatment arms that have completed accrual will be released on a rolling basis as their data mature. The trial is ongoing and enrolling patients at more than 1,100 cancer centers and community hospitals in every state, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico. All trial sites are either members of the research groups in the NCTN that focus on adult cancers&mdash;the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology, ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group, NRG Oncology, and SWOG&mdash;or are members of the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP).</p>
<p>Genentech, a member of the Roche group, provided the study drugs for Arms I and Q, and AstraZeneca provided the drug for Arm W.</p>

<p>New findings from the groundbreaking Trial Assigning Individualized Options for Treatment (Rx), or TAILORx trial, show no benefit from chemotherapy for 70 percent of women with the most common type of breast cancer. The study found that for women with hormone receptor (HR)<strong>-</strong>positive, HER2-negative, axillary lymph node&shy;&ndash;negative breast cancer, treatment with chemotherapy and hormone therapy after surgery is not more beneficial than treatment with hormone therapy alone. The new data, released at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting in Chicago, will help inform treatment decisions for many women with early-stage breast cancer.</p>
<p>The trial was supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and designed and led by the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. Findings from the study will be published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>.</p>
<p>"The new results from TAILORx give clinicians high-quality data to inform personalized treatment recommendations for women," said lead author Joseph A. Sparano, M.D., associate director for clinical research at the Albert Einstein Cancer Center and Montefiore Health System in New York City and vice chair of the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group. "These data confirm that using a 21-gene expression test to assess the risk of cancer recurrence can spare women unnecessary treatment if the test indicates that chemotherapy is not likely to provide benefit."</p>
<p>TAILORx, a phase 3 clinical trial, opened in 2006 and was designed to provide an evidence-based answer to the question of whether hormone therapy alone is not inferior to hormone therapy plus chemotherapy. The trial used a molecular test (Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score) that assesses the expression of 21 genes associated with breast cancer recurrence to assign women with early-stage, HR-positive, HER2-negative, axillary lymph node&shy;&ndash;negative breast cancer to the most appropriate and effective post-operative treatment. The trial enrolled 10,273 women with this type of breast cancer at 1,182 sites in the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, New Zealand, and Peru.</p>
<p>When patients enrolled in the trial, their tumors were analyzed using the 21-gene expression test and assigned a risk score (on a scale of 0&shy;&ndash;100) for cancer recurrence. Based on evidence from earlier trials, women in the trial who had a score in the low-risk range (0&shy;&ndash;10) received hormone therapy only, and those who had a score in the high-risk range (26 and above) were treated with hormone therapy and chemotherapy.</p>
<p>Women in the trial who had a score in the intermediate range (11&shy;&ndash;25) were randomly assigned to receive hormone therapy alone or hormone therapy with adjuvant chemotherapy. The goal was to assess whether women who received hormone therapy alone had outcomes that were as good as those among women who received chemotherapy in addition to hormone therapy.</p>
<p>"Until now, we've been able to recommend treatment for women with these cancers at high and low risk of recurrence, but women at intermediate risk have been uncertain about the appropriate strategy to take," said Jeffrey Abrams, M.D., associate director of NCI's Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program. "These findings, showing no benefit from receiving chemotherapy plus hormone therapy for most patients in this intermediate-risk group, will go a long way to support oncologists and patients in decisions about the best course of treatment."</p>
<p>The researchers found that the primary endpoint of the trial, invasive disease-free survival&mdash;the proportion of women who had not died or developed a recurrence or a second primary cancer&mdash;was very similar in both groups. Five years after treatment, the rate of invasive disease-free survival was 92.8 percent for those who had hormone therapy alone and 93.1 percent for those who also had chemotherapy. At nine years, the rate was 83.3 percent for those with hormone therapy alone and 84.3 percent for the group that had both therapies. None of these differences were considered statistically significant.</p>
<p>The rates of overall survival were also very similar in the two groups. At five years, the overall survival rate was 98.0 percent for those who received hormone therapy alone and 98.1 percent for those who received both therapies, and at nine years the respective overall survival rates were 93.9 percent and 93.8 percent.</p>
<p>The researchers also found that women with a score of 0&ndash;10 had very low recurrence rates with hormone therapy alone at nine years (3 percent). This confirms similar findings from earlier studies. In addition, they found that women with a score of 26&ndash;100 had a distant recurrence rate of 13 percent despite receiving both chemotherapy and hormone therapy. This finding indicates the need to develop more effective therapies for women at high risk of recurrence.</p>
<p>According to the authors, the new findings suggest that chemotherapy may be avoided in about 70 percent of women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer:</p>
<ul>
<li>older than 50 and with a recurrence score of 11&ndash;25 (45 percent)</li>
<li>any age with a recurrence score of 0&ndash;10 (16 percent)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>50 years old or younger with a recurrence score of 11&ndash;15 (8 percent)</li>
</ul>
<p>The findings suggest that chemotherapy may be considered for the remaining 30 percent of women with HR-positive, HER2-negative, node-negative breast cancer:</p>
<ul>
<li>any age with a recurrence score of 26&ndash;100 (17 percent)</li>
<li>50 years old or younger with a recurrence score of 16&ndash;25 (14 percent)</li>
</ul>
<p>The new results demonstrate that chemotherapy is not beneficial for most women in the intermediate-risk group. This data adds to findings from a TAILORx analysis published in 2015 that provided prospective evidence that the gene expression test could identify women with a low risk of recurrence who could be spared chemotherapy.</p>
<p>There is one caveat to the new findings. When the researchers analyzed premenopausal women and those younger than 50 years old at the higher end of the intermediate-risk range (16&ndash;25) separately, the results showed there may be a small benefit from chemotherapy, and thus these women should consider chemotherapy with their doctor. However, it is unclear if this benefit is due to the effect of chemotherapy or to endocrine suppression caused by chemotherapy-induced menopause.</p>
<p>"Before TAILORx, there was uncertainty about the best treatment for women with a mid-range score of 11&ndash;25 on the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test. The trial was designed to address this question and provides a very definitive answer," said Dr. Sparano. "Any woman with early-stage breast cancer age 75 or younger should have the 21-gene expression test and discuss the results with her doctor to guide her decision to the right therapy."</p>
<p>TAILORx was one of the first large-scale trials to examine a methodology for personalizing cancer treatment. When the trial was activated, the best available genomic profiling data in women with early-stage breast cancer were retrospective.</p>
<p>The study was supported in part by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, Komen Foundation, and the Breast Cancer Research Stamp. The stamp funding provided more than $5 million to the trial. Since 1998, when the charity stamp was authorized by Congress and first issued by the United States Postal Service, more than $86 million has been raised for breast cancer research. The net proceeds from sales of the stamp are transferred to NIH and the Medical Research Program of the Department of Defense to fund breast cancer research.</p>
<p>The genomic assay used in the trial was the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score test from Genomic Health, Inc., Redwood City, California.</p>

<p>Veterans with cancer who receive treatment from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will now have easier access to clinical trials of novel cancer treatments, thanks to an agreement between VA and the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>The NCI and VA Interagency Group to Accelerate Trials Enrollment, or NAVIGATE, which is launching at 12 VA facilities across the country, will enhance the ability of veterans to participate in trials carried out through NCI&rsquo;s National Clinical Trials Network (NCTN) and the NCI Community Oncology Research Program (NCORP). As part of the agreement, NCI will provide infrastructure funding support needed for the VA facilities to participate in NCI-sponsored trials, enhancing the ability of veterans with cancer to receive promising treatments locally. In turn, VA will manage organizational and operational activities within its national healthcare system to establish a network to focus on NCI trial goals.</p>
<p>&ldquo;NAVIGATE is an opportunity for VA and NCI to partner at the national level to make clinical trials more accessible to veterans,&rdquo; said James H. Doroshow, M.D., deputy director for Clinical and Translational Research, NCI. &ldquo;This agreement will not only provide veterans greater access to NCI clinical trials, it will enhance accrual to NCTN and NCORP trials, resulting in more timely completion of these studies. This interagency collaboration will also work to help veterans overcome barriers they&rsquo;ve faced trying to access clinical trials as part of their cancer care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>VA has a robust clinical research program that includes clinical trials in cancer and other diseases at approximately 100 sites nationwide. However, VA facilities often face challenges initiating and completing externally funded trials because of the need for partners to navigate the system. This program aims to overcome these challenges with dedicated staffing and a sustainable infrastructure, and to address existing barriers to trial enrollment that veterans, including minority patients, often experience. In addition, NAVIGATE will increase the participation of VA investigators in clinical cancer research, and provide opportunities for these researchers to identify studies that may be of particular importance to veterans with cancer.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After an application process, the 12 VA sites picked to participate in NAVIGATE are: Atlanta VA Health Care System; James J. Peters VA Medical Center in New York City; Ralph H. Johnson VA Medical Center in Charleston, South Carolina; VA Eastern Colorado Health Care System in Denver; Durham VA Medical Center in North Carolina; Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital in Hines, Illinois; Tibor Rubin VA Medical Center in Long Beach, California; Minneapolis VA Health Care System; VA Palo Alto Health Care System in California; Portland VA Medical Center in Portland, Oregon; Audie L. Murphy VA Hospital/South Texas Veterans Health Care System in San Antonio; and VA Connecticut Healthcare System in West Haven.</p>
<p>The program will be jointly managed by VA and NCI for up to three years. It is expected that, during this time, the participating VA sites will establish long-term capabilities to continue participation in NCI trials after this program ends. The NAVIGATE program sites will also establish best practices and share insights to help VA sites nationwide to initiate new studies and enroll more veterans in cancer clinical trials.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By increasing enrollment in cancer clinical trials, VA and veterans will be contributing to important oncology research,&rdquo; said VA Chief Research and Development Officer Rachel Ramoni, D.M.D., Sc.D. &ldquo;This will not only help our veterans, but also advance cancer care for all Americans, and people around the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>VA&rsquo;s involvement in NAVIGATE is being managed through the Cooperative Studies Program, part of VA&rsquo;s Office of Research and Development. NAVIGATE is overseen by an Executive Committee comprised of VA and NCI leadership responsible for ensuring effective coordination on key activities between the agencies and that program milestones are achieved.</p>

<p>The largest coordinated research effort to study biological and non-biological factors associated with aggressive prostate cancer in African-American men has begun. The $26.5 million study is called RESPOND, or Research on Prostate Cancer in Men of African Ancestry: Defining the Roles of Genetics, Tumor Markers, and Social Stress. It will investigate environmental and genetic factors related to aggressiveness of prostate cancer in African-American men to better understand why they disproportionally experience aggressive disease&mdash;that is, disease that grows and spreads quickly&mdash;compared with men of other racial and ethnic groups.&nbsp;</p>
<p>RESPOND is supported by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD), both parts of the National Institutes of Health, as well as by the Prostate Cancer Foundation (PCF). The NCI funding will be provided from the 21st Century Cures Cancer Moonshot Initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Understanding why African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer than men of other racial and ethnic groups is a critical, unanswered question in cancer disparities research,&rdquo; said NCI Director Ned Sharpless, M.D. &ldquo;This large, collaborative study&nbsp;can help the cancer research community better understand and address these disparities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>African-American men have about a 15 percent chance of developing prostate cancer in their lifetimes, compared to about a 10 percent chance for white men, and African-American men are more likely to be diagnosed with aggressive disease. In addition, the risk of dying from prostate cancer for African-American men is about 4 percent compared to about 2 percent for white men. With the RESPOND study, researchers aim to learn more about why these disparities exist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study, which is combining state-of-the-art molecular approaches with social and environmental science, will help unravel the complex interactions of biological, behavioral, and environmental factors that contribute to excess prostate cancer burden and poorer outcomes in African-American men, allowing development of tailored approaches for prevention, diagnosis, and treatment in this population,&rdquo; said NIMHD Director Eliseo P&eacute;rez-Stable, M.D.</p>
<p>The investigators aim to enroll 10,000 African-American men with prostate cancer into the RESPOND study. The participants will be identified primarily via NCI&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Program and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&rsquo;s National Program of Cancer Registries. In addition, this study builds on years of research collaboration involving investigators who are part of the African Ancestry Prostate Cancer (AAPC) consortium. These investigators will contribute additional information and samples from 10,000 African-American men with prostate cancer. In accordance with NIH data sharing policies, and with appropriate informed consent, the de-identified data and samples collected as part of this research will be made available as a resource to the scientific community, aiding future research.</p>
<p>Investigators in the study will examine possible associations between aggressive disease and exposures to neighborhood/environmental stressors such as discrimination, early-life adversity, and segregation. They will also study DNA and tumor samples to identify gene variants associated with aggressive prostate cancer. Once researchers have identified genetic changes associated with aggressive prostate cancer, they will investigate how the social environment interacts with those genetic changes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Previous research on prostate cancer disparities has investigated social and genetic factors separately, but we know these components interact with each other to contribute to disparities,&rdquo; said Damali Martin, Ph.D., program director for the study in NCI&rsquo;s Epidemiology and Genomics Research Program. &ldquo;The ability to integrate genetic and environmental factors, including individual, neighborhood, and societal factors, into one large study will enable us to have a better understanding of how all of these factors contribute to the aggressiveness of prostate cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>RESPOND, a cooperative agreement, will be led by Christopher Haiman, Sc.D., of the University of Southern California (USC) in Los Angeles, in collaboration with John Carpten, Ph.D., Ann Hamilton, Ph.D., and David Conti, Ph.D., also of USC; Scarlett Gomez, Ph.D., of the University of California, San Francisco; Tamara Lotan, M.D., of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore; and Franklin Huang, M.D., Ph.D., of Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.</p>
<p>NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics will perform genotyping, and the Center for Inherited Disease Research at Johns Hopkins University will conduct DNA sequencing for the genetic component of the study. NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Control and Population Sciences is administering the study grant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No group in the world is hit harder by prostate cancer than men of African descent, and, to date, little is known about the biological reasons for these disparities, or the full impact of environmental factors,&rdquo; said Jonathan W. Simons, M.D., PCF&rsquo;s president and CEO. &ldquo;We celebrate our partnership and applaud NIH for spearheading this study, which we believe will help pave the way for groundbreaking discoveries that will improve health equity for African-American men and their families.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a new study, researchers developed a gene expression predictor that can indicate whether melanoma in a specific patient is likely to respond to treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, a novel type of immunotherapy. The predictor was developed by Noam Auslander, Ph.D., with other researchers in the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and colleagues at Harvard University, Cambridge, Mass.; the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia; and the University of Maryland, College Park. The study was published&nbsp;August 20, 2018&nbsp;in Nature Medicine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a critical need to be able to predict how cancer patients will respond to this type of immunotherapy,&rdquo; said Eytan Ruppin, M.D., Ph.D., of NCI&rsquo;s newly established Cancer Data Science Laboratory, who led the study. &ldquo;Being able to predict who is highly likely to respond and who isn&rsquo;t will enable us to more accurately and precisely guide patients&rsquo; treatment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Treatment with checkpoint inhibitors is effective for some patients with late-stage melanoma and certain other types of cancer. However, not all patients with melanoma respond to this treatment, and it can have considerable side effects. Being able to predict which patients are likely to respond and which are not would be a major clinical advance. But developing a predictor of response has been challenging, partly because of the limited number of patients who have received this relatively new form of treatment.</p>
<p>In this study, the investigators developed a predictor by first looking for clues in cases where the immune system appears to mount an unprompted, successful immune response to cancer, causing spontaneous tumor regression. They analyzed neuroblastoma, a type of cancer that frequently undergoes spontaneous regression in young children, and were able to define gene expression features that separated patients with non-regressing disease from those with regressing disease.</p>
<p>These features enabled the researchers to compute what they called an IMmuno-PREdictive Score (IMPRES) for each patient sample. The higher the IMPRES score for a sample, the more likely it was to undergo spontaneous regression. To see if IMPRES could be used to predict melanoma patients&rsquo; responses to checkpoint inhibitors, the authors analyzed 297 samples from several studies. They found that the predictor could identify nearly all patients who responded to the inhibitors and more than half of those who did not, making it significantly superior to all other existing published predictors. Importantly, unlike other existing predictors, IMPRES was accurate across many different melanoma patient data sets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We now know that immunotherapy works, but we do not understand well why a particular therapy will work for some patients but not others,&rdquo; said Tom Misteli, Ph.D., director of CCR at NCI. &ldquo;This study is a step forward in developing tools to address this challenge, which is of practical importance to patients.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Ruppin said that while the results obtained are encouraging, they will need to be carefully evaluated in additional patient datasets. The authors also wrote that further study of this kind of predictor is now warranted in other cancer types for which checkpoint inhibitors have been approved.</p>

The trial’s goal was to find a less toxic treatment approach without compromising survival." field_feature_card_description="Study shows cisplatin with radiation remains standard of care." field_search_engine_restrictions="IncludeSearch" field_date_posted="2018-08-14" field_date_reviewed="2018-08-13" field_pretty_url="oropharyngeal-hpv-cisplatin" field_public_use="1" press_release_type="NCI Press Release"><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>An interim analysis of data from a randomized clinical trial of patients with human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive oropharyngeal cancer found that treatment with radiation therapy and cetuximab is associated with worse overall and progression-free survival compared to the current standard treatment with radiation and cisplatin. The trial was designed to see if cetuximab with radiation would be less toxic than cisplatin with radiation without compromising survival for patients with the disease.</p>
<p>The phase 3 trial, which closed enrollment in 2014, was funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and led by NRG Oncology, part of NCI&rsquo;s National Clinical Trials Network. The data monitoring committee overseeing the trial recommended releasing the data after an interim data analysis showed that cetuximab with radiation was associated with inferior overall and progression-free survival, compared to cisplatin and radiation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has previously approved cetuximab with radiation for patients with head and neck cancer, including oropharyngeal cancer. Cetuximab with radiation is an accepted standard of care, especially for patients who cannot tolerate cisplatin.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The goal of this trial was to find an alternative to cisplatin that would be as effective at controlling the cancer, but with fewer side effects,&rdquo; said Andy Trotti, M.D., of the Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa, Florida, a lead investigator of the trial. &ldquo;We were surprised by the loss of tumor control with cetuximab.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There has been a lot of recent interest in the cancer clinical research community in evaluating the &ldquo;de-escalation&rdquo; of therapies for cancers that have a good prognosis, such as HPV-positive cancer of the oropharynx (the part of the throat at the back of the mouth, including the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils). The goal is to improve patients&rsquo; quality of life and reduce long-term toxic effects without compromising treatment efficacy. HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer is frequently diagnosed in individuals in their 50s and 60s, and is associated with high survival rates, providing the incentive for this trial. Moreover, the incidence of this type of cancer has <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/news-events/cancer-currents-blog/2017/hpv-vaccine-oral-infection">increased rapidly</a> in recent years in the United States.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clinical trials designed to test less toxic treatment strategies for patients without compromising clinical benefit are a very important area of interest for NCI and the cancer research community,&rdquo; said Shakun Malik, M.D., of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Treatment and Diagnosis.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This trial&rsquo;s primary objective was to determine whether the substitution of cetuximab for cisplatin with radiation would result in comparable overall survival while reducing toxic side effects with improved long-term quality of life. The trial enrolled 849 patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer who were randomly assigned to receive either cetuximab or cisplatin with radiation. The study had three planned interim analyses.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The third and final interim analysis, done after a median follow-up of 4.5 years, found that overall survival on the cetuximab arm was significantly inferior to the cisplatin arm. Overall rates of serious (grade 3-5) adverse events were similar for patients in both groups. However, as the researchers expected, toxic side effects were different, with adverse events of renal toxicity, hearing loss, and bone marrow suppression more common in patients in the cisplatin arm, while body rash was more common in the cetuximab arm. <span>All patients in this trial had completed therapy at the time of this analysis.</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;This trial is the first randomized clinical trial specifically designed for patients with HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer, and it establishes cisplatin with radiation as the standard of care,&rdquo; said Maura Gillison, M.D, Ph.D., of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, the other lead investigator of the trial.</p>
<p>Full study details will be presented in the plenary session at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) <a href="http://www.astro.org/annualmeeting">Annual Meeting</a> in San Antonio, Texas on Oct. 22 at 2:15 pm CT. Findings from the trial will later be published in a peer-reviewed journal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), has been named a recipient of the 2018 Albany Medical Center Prize in Medicine and Biomedical Research for his leading role in the development of immunotherapy to treat cancer. Dr. Rosenberg will share the honor with fellow immunotherapy researchers James P. Allison, Ph.D., and Carl H. June, M.D.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg is chief of the surgery branch at NCI, part of the National Institutes of Health. Dr. Allison is chair of the Department of Immunology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. Dr. June is director of the Center for Cellular Immunotherapy in the Abramson Cancer Center at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. Dr. Allison and Dr. June are supported by NCI grants and conduct research at NCI-designated cancer centers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We congratulate these amazing scientists for receiving this prestigious award. Their visionary work exemplifies the value of the national cancer program. Each has had a long history of NCI support and I celebrate their achievement,&rdquo; said Ned Sharpless, M.D., director of NCI. &ldquo;Dr. Rosenberg is a pioneer whose immunotherapy work has advanced cancer treatment to an immeasurable degree. His innovations have changed patients&rsquo; lives.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The award has been given annually since 2001 to &ldquo;those who have altered the course of medical research,&rdquo; according to the organization. A statement from the Albany Medical Center said the prize is being awarded to &ldquo;three visionary scientists whose work has led to a revolutionary new way to treat cancer and other diseases.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because of the work of these three researchers, the nascent field of immunotherapy has already had spectacular success, leading to effective mitigation and often cures for thousands of cancer and HIV patients whose diseases were not treatable by other methods,&rdquo; said Vincent Verdile, M.D., the Lynne and Mark Groban Distinguished Dean of Albany Medical College and chair of the Albany Prize National Selection Committee. &ldquo;Their impact on the development of cancer immunotherapy &ndash; and where it goes from here &ndash; is unsurpassed.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Dr. Rosenberg started at NCI in the 1970s, little was known about T lymphocyte function in cancer. He became the first to develop effective immunotherapies and gene therapies for selected patients with advanced cancer and to successfully insert foreign genes into humans. His studies of the adoptive cell transfer (ACT) of genetically modified lymphocytes have resulted in the regression of metastatic cancer in patients with melanoma, sarcomas, lymphomas, and other cancers. In October 2017, the Food and Drug Administration approved a form of immunotherapy called CAR T-cell therapy initially developed by Dr. Rosenberg and colleagues for certain lymphomas.&nbsp;</p>
<p>His current research is aimed at extending ACT to patients with common solid cancers. In June, findings were published on a new approach Dr. Rosenberg developed using a modified form of ACT that led to the complete regression of breast cancer in a patient who was unresponsive to all other treatments.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Steve Rosenberg is a medical trailblazer who envisioned before anyone else a revolutionary new approach to cancer therapy that will soon be taken for granted,&rdquo; said Tom Misteli, Ph.D., director of CCR at NCI. &ldquo;In his work over decades at NCI, he has taken full advantage of the ability provided by the NCI Intramural Research program to pursue high-risk, long-term research and we are fortunate to have him as a colleague.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Albany Medical Center Prize was established in 2000 by the late Morris &ldquo;Marty&rdquo; Silverman to honor scientists whose work has demonstrated significant outcomes that offer medical value of national or international importance. A $50 million gift commitment from the Marty and Dorothy Silverman Foundation provides for the prize to be awarded annually for 100 years. Three previous Nobel Prize winners have been among the researchers honored, and five Albany Prize recipients have gone on to win the Nobel Prize.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m honored to receive this award, and to be recognized with such luminaries in this field,&rdquo; Dr. Rosenberg said. &ldquo;While in some ways we&rsquo;re still just at the start of seeing what immunotherapy can do, every day we&rsquo;re seeing more progress, and we are confident that this treatment will take dramatic steps forward in the years to come.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The prize will be awarded during a celebration on Wednesday, Sept. 26, in Albany, New York.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>

<p>The passing of Senator John McCain is a moment of true sadness for our country. Few have served this country for so long and with such commitment and distinction.</p>
<p>Even as he underwent treatment for an aggressive brain cancer, Sen. McCain continued to play an active role in Congress&mdash;something that comes as no surprise, given his lifelong legacy of dedication and service.</p>
<p>Shortly after his diagnosis in July 2017, Sen. McCain received treatment at the NIH Clinical Center, under the care of NCI physicians and nurses. In November of last year, in a kind and gracious speech on the Senate floor, he thanked those at NCI who directly provided that care.</p>
<p>During that speech, he also took the time to thank all of those engaged in cancer research and care, hailing what he called the &ldquo;patient forms of bravery exemplified by our doctors and nurses and research scientists.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To be called brave by a courageous and upstanding man like Sen. McCain is very high praise.</p>
<p>Sen. McCain, and his upholding of the ideals of commitment to a greater good, will be dearly missed. His family will continue to be in the thoughts of NCI staff, just as they are among those of millions of Americans across the country.</p>

<p>An interim analysis of a large phase 3 clinical trial found that the combination of ibrutinib plus rituximab was superior to standard treatment for patients age 70 and younger with previously untreated chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). The trial met its primary endpoint of an improvement in progression-free survival (the length of time patients live before their disease worsens). The combination also improved overall survival, the trial&rsquo;s secondary endpoint. In general, patients in the ibrutinib&ndash;rituximab arm were less likely to experience serious side effects than those in the standard treatment arm. Until now, the standard treatment for previously untreated CLL has been a six-month course of FCR, which combines the chemotherapy drugs fludarabine and cyclophosphamide with rituximab.</p>
<p>The data and safety monitoring board overseeing the trial, known as E1912, recommended that these results be released immediately given their significance to public health. The findings were presented as a late-breaking abstract at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) annual meeting on December 4, 2018. The trial was sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and designed by researchers with the ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group.</p>
<p>"These results are practice-changing and immediately establish ibrutinib and rituximab as the new standard of care for the initial treatment of CLL in patients age 70 and younger," said lead investigator Tait Shanafelt, M.D., a professor of hematology at the Stanford University School of Medicine in Palo Alto, California. "The E1912 trial showed that the combination of ibrutinib and rituximab not only provided better leukemia control, it also prolonged life and had fewer side effects."</p>
<p>"These definitive results show why large trials like this, that test new therapies in an effort to achieve clinically meaningful benefit for patients, are so important," said Richard F. Little, M.D., of the Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program at NCI.</p>
<p>The study was conducted through NCI&rsquo;s National Clinical Trials Network. Pharmacyclics LLC provided ibrutinib and clinical trial support funding under a cooperative research and development agreement with NCI and a separate agreement with ECOG-ACRIN.</p>
<p>CLL is one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. It typically occurs during or after middle age and rarely occurs in individuals under the age of 40. Ibrutinib and rituximab are targeted treatments. Ibrutinib interferes with the survival of lymphocytic leukemia cells, and rituximab enhances the ability of the body's immune system to destroy the cells. Ibrutinib is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of some blood cancers, including CLL.</p>
<p>The trial enrolled 529 patients between January 2014 and June 2016. Those enrolled in the trial were adults age 70 and younger who had never received treatment for CLL and required treatment. Patients were randomly assigned to receive either the ibrutinib&ndash;rituximab combination or FCR.</p>
<p>The first planned interim analysis for progression-free survival was performed in September 2018. With a median follow-up of 33.4 months, the hazard ratio for progression-free survival favored the ibrutinib group over the FCR group (HR=0.352). This means that, at any given time, the risk of disease progression was reduced by about two-thirds (65 percent) for patients in the ibrutinib group compared with the FCR group. This observed improvement in progression-free survival exceeded the trial design target. Overall survival was also superior for patients in the ibrutinib arm.</p>
<p>According to the data and safety monitoring board's recommendation, the outcome has been disclosed to all patients participating in the study and their physicians. Patients who are receiving ibrutinib in the trial can continue therapy, as long as it remains effective. All patients assigned to FCR have completed treatment and are continuing to be monitored per standard of care. Quality of life was rigorously measured in both arms, and the data are awaiting analysis.</p>
<p>Findings from another NCI-supported trial on ibrutinib in patients with CLL were also presented at the ASH meeting and published in <em>The New England Journal of Medicine</em>. The A041202 trial&mdash;an international phase 3 clinical trial coordinated by the Alliance for Clinical Trials in Oncology&mdash;demonstrated that ibrutinib produces superior progression-free survival compared with standard chemoimmunotherapy (bendamustine plus rituximab) in previously untreated patients with CLL who are age 65 and older. The study found that adding rituximab to ibrutinib did not improve progression-free survival beyond ibrutinib alone.</p>
<p>"These two NCI-funded trials have collectively established ibrutinib-based therapy as the first line treatment for CLL patients of any age," Dr. Little said.</p>

<p>Findings from a new study by researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) show that patients treated with chemotherapy for most solid tumors during 2000&ndash;2014 experienced an increased risk of therapy-related myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (tMDS/AML). The study, which used U.S. population-based cancer registry data from NCI&rsquo;s Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program and treatment information from the SEER&ndash;Medicare database, was published December 20, 2018, in <em>JAMA Oncology</em>. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Advances in treatment over the last several decades have resulted in improved survival for patients with many types of cancer. However, survivors may be at increased risk of developing a subsequent treatment-related cancer. In this study, researchers aimed to quantify the risk of developing tMDS/AML, a rare but often fatal blood cancer, in patients treated with chemotherapy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve known for a long time that the development of myeloid leukemia is a very rare adverse effect of some types of cancer treatments that damage cells,&rdquo; said Lindsay Morton, Ph.D., lead author of the study and a senior investigator in NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics. &ldquo;There have been many changes in cancer treatment over time, including the introduction of new chemotherapy drugs and drug combinations, but we didn&rsquo;t know what the risk of therapy-related leukemia looked like for patients since these changes were made.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Because tMDS/AML is rare, most data on the disease have come from case series, case&ndash;control studies, and clinical trials, which often include a relatively small number of tMDS/AML cases. In this study, investigators brought a population-based data approach to the research, with a much larger sample size and prospective data from long-term patient follow-up.</p>
<p>To this end, they analyzed SEER registry data on more than 700,000 patients age 20&ndash;84 in the United States with solid tumors who were diagnosed and treated with initial chemotherapy during 2000&ndash;2013 and survived at least one year after diagnosis. Of these patients, 1,619 developed tMDS/AML through 2014. When the researchers analyzed the risk of tMDS/AML by original cancer type, they found that risk was increased by 1.5-fold to more than 10-fold for 22 of the 23 solid cancer types investigated (all except colon cancer).</p>
<p>These findings expand the groups of survivors at risk of tMDS/AML following treatment with chemotherapy because, in the past, excess risks were established only after chemotherapy for cancers of the lung, ovary, breast, soft tissue, testis, and brain/central nervous system. In the present analysis, cumulative incidence of tMDS/AML was less than 1 percent at 10 years after chemotherapy for most solid cancer types. However, prognosis following tMDS/AML diagnosis was very poor.</p>
<p>Because information on the specific chemotherapy agents was not available in the SEER registry data, the researchers used the SEER&ndash;Medicare linked database to examine the patterns of use of specific chemotherapy agents during the same time period. Among 165,000 patients in the SEER&ndash;Medicare database who received initial chemotherapy for a first primary solid cancer during the study period, 2000&ndash;2013, there was a substantial rise in use of platinum-based chemotherapy agents, from 57 percent of patients in 2000&ndash;2001, to 81 percent of patients in 2012&ndash;2013. Platinum-based chemotherapy agents are known to increase risk of tMDS/AML.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The most important message from this study is that, while advances in cancer treatment approaches have improved the prognosis for many types of cancer, the number of patients at risk of developing rare, therapy-related leukemia after cancer chemotherapy in the modern treatment era has markedly expanded,&rdquo; Dr. Morton said. &ldquo;Assessments of treatment risks and benefits should balance these risks and other adverse effects of chemotherapy against potential gains in survival following treatment for the initial solid cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The researchers wrote that their study shows that continued efforts to minimize exposure to leukemia-causing chemotherapy agents and to develop effective and less toxic chemotherapeutic approaches are critical going forward.</p>

<p>A global resource that includes data on thousands of inherited variants in the <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> genes is available to the public. The BRCA Exchange was created through the BRCA Challenge, a long-term&nbsp;demonstration project initiated by the Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) to enhance sharing of <em>BRCA1 </em>and<em> BRCA2</em> data. The resource, available through a website and a new <a href="https://brcaexchange.org/about/app">smartphone app</a>, allows clinicians to review expert classifications of variants in these major cancer predisposition genes as part of their individual assessment of complex questions related to cancer prevention, screening, and intervention for high-risk patients.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The five-year BRCA Challenge project was funded in part by the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, and through the <a href="https://www.cancer.gov/research/key-initiatives/moonshot-cancer-initiative">Cancer Moonshot</a><span>℠</span>. A paper detailing the development of the BRCA Exchange was published January 8, 2019, in&nbsp;<em>PLOS Genetics</em>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This project has yielded a meta-analysis of <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2 </em>variants collected from multiple sources to understand how experts annotate specific mutations in the two genes,&rdquo; said Stephen J. Chanock, M.D., director of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics and lead author of the paper. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s an urgent need for sharing data in cancer predisposition research. The BRCA Exchange is proof of principle that large-scale collaboration and data sharing can be achieved and can provide the latest and best quality information to enable clinicians and individuals to improve care.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Certain inherited variants in these genes can increase the risk of breast, ovarian, and other cancers by varying degrees, whereas others are not associated with disease. Clinicians and patients need to know whether a given variant is likely to be disease-associated (pathogenic) and how likely a pathogenic variant is to cause cancer (penetrance). Until now, the available data on the inherited variants in these genes were not aggregated in a comprehensive way.</p>
<p>The BRCA Exchange dataset is composed of information from existing clinical databases&mdash;the Breast Cancer Information Core, ClinVar, and the Leiden Open Variation Database&mdash;as well as population databases and data from clinicians, clinical laboratories, and researchers worldwide. It currently includes more than 20,000 unique <em>BRCA1</em> and <em>BRCA2</em> variants. More than 6,100 variants in the database have been classified by an expert panel, the Evidence-based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles, and approximately 3,700 of these variants are known to cause disease. The BRCA Exchange pools variants from data resources worldwide, which should lead to inclusion of rare variants that are very occasionally observed.</p>
<p>With a single-point-of-access website (<a href="http://www.brcaexchange.org">www.brcaexchange.org</a>), the BRCA Exchange provides information on these gene variants to clinicians, researchers, data scientists, patients, and patient advocates. It also serves as a demonstration project showing that this kind of comprehensive data sharing&mdash;requiring collaboration across hundreds of organizations, the establishment of an infrastructure to house the information, and the development of data-sharing protocols&mdash;is possible for other cancer predisposition genes and, indeed, for genes associated with other diseases.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Next steps for the project include collaboration with additional global data generators and data holders, continued technical development, and increased engagement with patients and patient advocates around the world.</p>

<p>A research team led by investigators from the National Institutes of Health and Global Good has developed a computer algorithm that can analyze digital images of a woman&rsquo;s cervix and accurately identify precancerous changes that require medical attention. This artificial intelligence (AI) approach, called automated visual evaluation, has the potential to revolutionize cervical cancer screening, particularly in low-resource settings.</p>
<p>To develop the method, researchers used comprehensive datasets to &ldquo;train&rdquo; a deep, or machine, learning algorithm to recognize patterns in complex visual inputs, such as medical images. The approach was created collaboratively by investigators at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and <a href="http://www.globalgood.com">Global Good</a>, a fund at Intellectual Ventures, and the findings were confirmed independently by experts at the National Library of Medicine (NLM). The results appeared in the <em>Journal of the National Cancer Institute</em> on January 10, 2019. NCI and NLM are parts of NIH.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our findings show that a deep learning algorithm can use images collected during routine cervical cancer screening to identify precancerous changes that, if left untreated, may develop into cancer,&rdquo; said Mark Schiffman, M.D., M.P.H., of NCI&rsquo;s Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics, and senior author of the study. &ldquo;In fact, the computer analysis of the images was better at identifying precancer than a human expert reviewer of Pap tests under the microscope (cytology).&rdquo;</p>
<p>The new method has the potential to be of particular value in low-resource settings. Health care workers in such settings currently use a screening method called visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). In this approach, a health worker applies dilute acetic acid to the cervix and inspects the cervix with the naked eye, looking for &ldquo;aceto whitening,&rdquo; which indicates possible disease. Because of its convenience and low cost, VIA is widely used where more advanced screening methods are not available. However, it is known to be inaccurate and needs improvement.</p>
<p>Automated visual evaluation is similarly easy to perform. Health workers can use a cell phone or similar camera device for cervical screening and treatment during a single visit. In addition, this approach can be performed with minimal training, making it ideal for countries with limited health care resources, where cervical cancer is a leading cause of illness and death among women.</p>
<p>To create the algorithm, the research team used more than 60,000 cervical images from an NCI archive of photos collected during a cervical cancer screening study that was carried out in Costa Rica in the 1990s. More than 9,400 women participated in that population study, with follow up that lasted up to 18 years. Because of the prospective nature of the study, the researchers gained nearly complete information on which cervical changes became precancers and which did not. The photos were digitized and then used to train a deep learning algorithm so that it could distinguish cervical conditions requiring treatment from those not requiring treatment.</p>
<p>Overall, the algorithm performed better than all standard screening tests at predicting all cases diagnosed during the Costa Rica study. Automated visual evaluation identified precancer with greater accuracy (AUC=0.91) than a human expert review (AUC=0.69) or conventional cytology (AUC=0.71). An AUC of 0.5 indicates a test that is no better than chance, whereas an AUC of 1.0 represents a test with perfect accuracy in identifying disease.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this algorithm is combined with advances in HPV vaccination, emerging HPV detection technologies, and improvements in treatment, it is conceivable that cervical cancer could be brought under control, even in low-resource settings,&rdquo; said Maurizio Vecchione, executive vice president of Global Good.</p>
<p>The researchers plan to further train the algorithm on a sample of representative images of cervical precancers and normal cervical tissue from women in communities around the world, using a variety of cameras and other imaging options. This step is necessary because of subtle variations in the appearance of the cervix among women in different geographic regions. The ultimate goal of the project is to create the best possible algorithm for common, open use.</p>

<p>The 2019 Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi Prize for Progress in Cancer Research will be awarded to Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., of the Center for Cancer Research (CCR) at the National Cancer Institute (NCI), one of the National Institutes of Health. The prize, awarded annually by the National Foundation for Cancer Research (NFCR), recognizes Dr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s pioneering role in the development of adoptive immunotherapy to treat cancer.</p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg, chief of CCR&rsquo;s Surgery Branch, developed the first effective immunotherapies and gene therapies for selected patients with advanced cancer and was the first to successfully insert foreign genes&mdash;in this case, genetically modified T cells&mdash;into humans. His immunotherapy clinical trials have resulted in the regression of metastatic cancer in patients with melanoma, sarcomas, lymphomas, and other cancers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s groundbreaking work has changed cancer research and what we know about treatment, but his findings have also immeasurably changed patients&rsquo; lives,&rdquo; said NCI Director Ned Sharpless, M.D. &ldquo;We are proud to see him awarded the Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi Prize, which recognizes work that has lasting impact while also honoring the importance of basic research in understanding cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Rosenberg&rsquo;s clinical trials of the protein interleukin 2 (IL-2) led to the first immunotherapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for cancer in 1992. When investigating the mechanism of IL-2 that causes cancer regression in patients with metastatic melanoma, Dr. Rosenberg identified immune cells that had cancer-fighting properties called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs). He and his team were the first to show in clinical trials that TILs extracted from a tumor, grown to large numbers in the lab, and then administered back to a patient, a treatment known as adoptive cell transfer (ACT) immunotherapy, could lead to tumor regression in patients with advanced melanoma. &nbsp;</p>
<p>With his team, Dr. Rosenberg also initially developed a form of ACT immunotherapy in which a patient&rsquo;s T cells are removed, genetically engineered in the laboratory to bind to specific proteins on cancer cells and kill them, and then administered back to the patient. He was the first to use T lymphocytes genetically engineered to express a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) to successfully treat patients with aggressive lymphomas. In 2017, the FDA approved the first CAR T-cell therapies for children and young adults with a form of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and then for adults with advanced lymphomas. At the time, William Dahut, M.D., scientific director for clinical research in CCR, called the first approval of CAR T-cell therapy &ldquo;a landmark moment for cancer immunotherapy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In his current research, Dr. Rosenberg is working to extend ACT to patients with common epithelial cancers. In June 2018, <em>Nature Medicine </em><a href="https://percussion.cancer.gov:443/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_revision=3&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_variantid=704&amp;sys_contentid=1116310" sys_contentid="1116310" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" sys_variantid="704" sys_relationshipid="7251206" sys_siteid="305" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="1116310" sys_dependentvariantid="704">published findings</a><em>&nbsp;</em>on a new approach he developed using a modified form of ACT that led to the complete regression of breast cancer in a patient whose cancer was unresponsive to all other treatments. Though still experimental, the new approach is dependent on targeting mutations, giving it the potential to be used for the treatment of many kinds of cancer. &nbsp;</p>
<p>According to NFCR, the Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi Prize honors scientists &ldquo;who have made an original discovery or breakthrough in scientific understanding that has had a lasting impact on the cancer field and a direct impact of saving people&rsquo;s lives.&rdquo; The prize was established in 2006 in honor of NFCR&rsquo;s cofounder, Albert Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi, M.D., Ph.D., who received the 1937 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his study of vitamin C and cell respiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m honored to receive the Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi Prize, and to be in the company of the scientists who have been recognized with this award,&rdquo; Dr. Rosenberg said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;re still learning about what immunotherapy can do for cancer patients, and we&rsquo;re very excited about the advances to come.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Last year&rsquo;s Szent-Gy&ouml;rgyi Prize was also awarded to intramural researchers at NCI: Douglas R. Lowy, M.D., and John T. Schiller, Ph.D., for their work on the development of vaccines against the human papillomavirus (HPV).</p>
<p>&ldquo;For the NCI Intramural Program to be recognized twice in a row with this prestigious award is humbling,&rdquo; said Tom Misteli, Ph.D., director of CCR at NCI. &ldquo;But it reflects the unique research environment of the NCI Center for Cancer Research, which has allowed Steve Rosenberg to not only envision the potential of immunotherapy, but also lead its practical implementation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prize will be presented at a ceremony at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., on April 27, 2019.</p>

<p>A new study shows that it is possible to use an imaging technique called cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to view, in atomic detail, the binding of a potential small molecule drug to a key protein in cancer cells. The cryo-EM images also helped the researchers establish, at atomic resolution, the sequence of structural changes that normally occur in the protein, p97, an enzyme critical for protein regulation that is thought to be a novel anti-cancer target.</p>
<p>The study appeared online January 28, 2016, in Science. Sriram Subramaniam, Ph.D., of the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s (NCI) Center for Cancer Research, led the research. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cryo-EM is positioned to become an even more useful tool in structural biology and cancer drug development,&rdquo; said Douglas Lowy, M.D., acting director, NCI. &ldquo;This latest finding provides a tantalizing possibility for advancing effective drug development.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To determine structures by cryo-EM, protein suspensions are flash-frozen at very low temperatures; nevertheless, the water around the protein molecules stays liquid-like. The suspensions are then bombarded with electrons to capture their images. To produce three-dimensional protein structures using cryo-EM, researchers generate thousands of two-dimensional images of the molecules in different orientations, which are then averaged together. This type of imaging procedure has gained in popularity in structural biology research because it allows for the observation of specimens that have not been stained or fixed in any way, enabling visualization of the specimens under near-native, or natural, conditions.</p>
<p>Earlier structural studies of full-length p97 by a well-established technique known as X-ray crystallography have been limited so far to medium resolution (3.5 &Aring; to 4.7 &Aring;). With cryo-EM, however, researchers were able to image full-length p97 at an overall resolution of 2.3 &Aring;, which is much finer, allowing them to visualize key regions of the protein in atomic detail.</p>
<p>Most significantly, the mode of binding and contact sites of a small molecule inhibitor of p97 activity could be observed directly. Drug development efforts often involve mapping the contacts between small molecules and their binding sites on specific proteins. With this latest finding, the resolutions achieved were significant enough to discern both the shape of the protein chain and some of the hydrogen bonds between the protein and the small molecule inhibitor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our latest research provides new insights into the protein structures and interactions that are critical for the activity of a cancer cell, and this knowledge will hopefully enable the design of clinically useful drugs,&rdquo; said Subramaniam.</p>
<p>Subramaniam and colleagues recently used cryo-EM to understand the functioning of a variety of molecules, including proteins and receptors found in brain cells. The level of detail achieved in their new study however, resolutions of 2.3 &Aring; and 2.4 &Aring; for p97 with and without the bound inhibitor, are second only the 2.2 &Aring; resolution structure reported last year in Science for an enzyme, also by the same group of NCI researchers.</p>

<p>Researchers at NCI have found that costimulatory signals can regulate T cell exhaustion, a process that limits the effectiveness of cancer immunotherapies. T cells are white blood cells that help fight infection and cancer. In this study, the investigators engineered T cells to produce artificial receptors called chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) on their surface, a promising approach to cancer treatment. CARs contain antigen recognition regions that allow the CAR T cells to recognize specific molecules (antigens) on tumor cells. CARs also contain intracellular stimulatory and costimulatory domains that provide signals necessary for full activation of the T cells. T cells engineered to express these CARs can then target and destroy tumor cells. However, during prolonged exposure to infection or tumor cells, T cells can lose their ability to function, a process known as T cell exhaustion. The NCI researchers found that some CAR T cells undergo early T cell exhaustion, a functional state that limits their effectiveness in fighting cancer. The researchers also found that changing the types of costimulatory signals that are included in the CAR can improve the function of CAR T cells by preventing exhaustion. This effort was led by Crystal Mackall, M.D., chief of the Pediatric Oncology Branch, Center for Cancer Research, NCI, and Adrienne Long, an M.D.-Ph.D. student in the laboratory. Their findings appeared May 4, 2015, in <i>Nature Medicine</i>.</p>

<p>While developing CAR T cells targeting an antigen called GD2, the scientists observed that some CARs cause continuous activation of the T cells that express them, independent of the presence of antigen. This antigen-independent signaling triggered CAR T cell exhaustion, which limited the cells’ ability to kill cancer in mice. The antigen-independent CAR signaling and CAR T cell exhaustion was seen to varying degrees with all CARs they tested, with the exception of the CD19 CAR, which has demonstrated effectiveness against acute lymphoblastic leukemia in early-phase trials. These findings indicate that exhaustion is a critical factor limiting the efficacy of some CAR T cells and provides a biologic basis to explain the dramatic anti-tumor effects of CD19 CARs. But the effect is less impressive, thus far, using CARs targeting other antigens. The researchers then used the GD2 CAR as a model of chronic CAR T cell signaling and exhaustion to study how changing the costimulatory molecule in the CAR affects CAR T cell exhaustion. They found that the costimulatory signals CD28 and 4-1BB had opposing effects on CAR T cell exhaustion, with CD28 increasing T cell exhaustion and 4-1BB decreasing it. These findings suggest that incorporating the 4-1BB costimulatory signal into CARs may be important in developing CAR T cells for clinical application. Experiments are underway to further explain the mechanism by which 4-1BB signaling prevents exhaustion in T cells, according to Mackall.</p>

<p>In the most comprehensive molecular characterization to date of adrenocortical carcinoma, a rare cancer of the adrenal cortex, researchers extensively analyzed 91 cases for alterations in the tumor genomes. They identified several novel genetic mutations as likely mechanisms driving the disease. They also found that whole genome doubling, wherein a cell has one or more extra sets of chromosomes, as a probable driver of the disease. The study, by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network, was led by Roel Verhaak, Ph.D., MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, and appeared in <i>Cancer Cell</i>, May 9, 2016. TCGA is a collaboration jointly supported and managed by NCI and National Human Genome Research Institute. This analysis supports previous findings that overexpression of <i>IGF2</i>, a gene encoding a peptide hormone involved in cell growth, and mutation of <i>TP53</i>, a common tumor suppressor gene involved in cell cycle regulation, are hallmarks of adrenocortical carcinoma. In addition, the study identified several novel gene mutations that likely contribute to the development of this disease. In particular, mutations in the gene <i>PRKAR1A</i>, found in 8 percent of cases in this study, have previously been associated with adrenocortical tumors, including both adenomas and rare carcinomas.</p>
<p>The study's analysis of somatic copy number alterations, or changes in chromosome structure or number that influence gene expression, revealed that copy number alterations also likely play a critical role in adrenocortical carcinoma. Whole genome doubling was observed in a higher proportion of adrenocortical carcinoma cases (51 percent) than in any of twelve other cancer types used for comparison. In addition, hypoploidy, or the loss of a significant amount of the genome, was found in a higher proportion of cases (31 percent) than in each of twelve comparison cancer types, with the exception of kidney chromophobe carcinoma (37 percent). The researchers propose that a common course in tumor development may be a loss of DNA, resulting in hypoploidy, followed by whole genome doubling. This mechanism could effectively rid the tumor of normal copies of genes that would prevent cancer, while duplicating genes that harbor cancer-causing mutations. The study further showed that the frequency of copy number changes was associated with an aggressive clinical course of the disease, supporting whole genome doubling as a significant contributor in driving this disease. Adrenocortical carcinoma affects less than one person per one million in the U.S. When detected early, the disease can be treated with surgery, but effective treatments for patients with later-stage disease have not yet been identified, leading to a poor 5-year survival rate of less than 15 percent for patients with the most advanced stage of the disease.</p>

<p>The National Cancer Institute (NCI) announced a collaboration with the <a href="https://www.themmrf.org/">Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation</a> (MMRF) to incorporate MMRF's wealth of genomic and clinical data about the disease into the NCI <a href="https://gdc.cancer.gov/">Genomic Data Commons</a> (GDC), a publicly available database that promotes the sharing of genomic and clinical data among researchers and facilitates precision medicine in oncology. The MMRF, located in Norwalk, Connecticut, is the first nonprofit organization&nbsp;to donate information to the GDC, which will include data on more than 30,000 patients who have many other types of cancers by the end of the year. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer, but large amounts of genomic data about this disease and other cancers have not been readily accessible to the research community. At a meeting in Boston today,<span>&nbsp;the </span><a href="http://www.economist.com/events-conferences/americas/woc">Health Care Forum: War on Cancer</a><span> hosted by The Economist, leaders in the healthcare field discussed the benefits of this new partnership. &nbsp;</span></p>
<p>&ldquo;Data sharing is essential to advancing cancer research, and I cannot overstate the value of the data that MMRF is providing &mdash; not only genomic data but also full clinical data as well,&rdquo; said Doug Lowy, M.D., NCI acting director. &ldquo;Combining genomic and clinical information will create an invaluable resource for all researchers worldwide studying this disease who are working toward new, more effective treatments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span>The MMRF is a research and advocacy organization conducting clinical studies that incorporate whole-genome, whole-exome, and RNA sequencing into their study analyses," said Louis Staudt, M.D., Ph.D., director of NCI's Center for Cancer Genomics. &ldquo;</span>The GDC gains power with each new submission, and the contribution of MMRF data will enable the discovery of potentially actionable and life-changing insights into multiple myeloma and its response to therapy that could be used by cancer researchers, doctors, and patients.&rdquo;</p>

Importantly, all patient information in the GDC has been de-identified, meaning that personal information, such as addresses, Social Security numbers, and other possible identifiers, are not present &mdash; only crucial genetic data and key demographic information are available.</p>
<p>An important contribution to the GDC will be information from MMRF&rsquo;s newest genomic study, Relating Clinical&nbsp;Outcomes in&nbsp;MM&nbsp;to&nbsp;Personal&nbsp;Assessment of Genetic Profile (CoMMpass, NCT01454297).&nbsp; The trial <span>has enrolled more than 1,150 patients to date and is currently the largest genomic and clinical study of this disease. African Americans represent about 18 percent&nbsp;of the patients enrolled CoMMpass, based on an interim analysis. The participation of African Americans in this study is significant given that multiple myeloma occurs about twice as often in African Americans than in whites.</span></p>
<p><span>Over the next eight years or longer, patients in CoMMpass will get a repeat biopsy and a new genomic analysis at each six-month checkup and/or at disease progression.&nbsp;</span><span>Tumor </span>samples are being collected and&nbsp;analyzed when possible at the time of any relapse. The genomic data from these analyses will be immediately deposited in the GDC, with an anticipated sample size of near 1,000 cases by the spring of 2017. New data will be deposited every six months at a minimum.</p>
<p><span>The MMRF will also share data from the 204-patient Towards a Genomic Understanding of Myeloma study, also known as the MMRF Multiple Myeloma Genomics Initiative. Through this initiative, whole genome sequencing of the myeloma genome was completed for the first time. </span></p>
<p><span>"GDC&rsquo;s visualization tools and browsing capabilities will make the MMRF myeloma data more accessible and could help jumpstart research into this cancer," noted Staudt.</span></p>
<p>The GDC is a core component of the Cancer Moonshot and the President&rsquo;s Precision Medicine Initiative&reg;, and it benefits from $70 million allocated to NCI to lead efforts in cancer genomics as part of the initiative.</p>

<p>In a study of an immune therapy for colorectal cancer that involved a single patient, a team of researchers at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) identified a method for targeting the cancer-causing protein produced by a mutant form of the KRAS gene. This targeted immunotherapy led to cancer regression in the patient in the study. The finding appeared Dec. 8, 2016, in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was led by Steven A. Rosenberg, M.D., Ph.D., chief of the Surgery Branch at NCI&rsquo;s Center for Cancer Research, and was conducted at the NIH Clinical Center. NCI is part of the National Institutes of Health.</p>
<p>More than 30 percent of all human cancers are driven by mutations in a family of genes known collectively as RAS, which has three members: KRAS, NRAS, and HRAS. Mutations in the KRAS gene are thought to drive 95 percent of all pancreatic cancers and 45 percent of all colorectal cancers. A mutation called G12D is the most common KRAS mutation and is estimated to occur in more than 50,000 new cases of cancer in the United States each year. Because of their importance in cancer causation, worldwide efforts to successfully target mutant RAS genes are being pursued. Such efforts have met with limited success to date.</p>
<p>In attempting to develop more effective approaches to targeting RAS, Rosenberg&rsquo;s team isolated tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that targeted the KRAS G12D mutation from tumor nodules in the patient&rsquo;s lungs that developed after colorectal cancer cells had spread to the lungs. TILs are white blood cells that migrate from the bloodstream into a tumor.</p>
<p>The isolated TILs were grown in the laboratory to large numbers and then infused into the patient intravenously. Following the TIL infusion, all seven metastatic lung nodules in the patient regressed, and the regression persisted for nine months.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>After nine months, one of the lesions progressed and was surgically removed. This lesion was found to have lost a segment of chromosome 6 that includes a gene known as HLA-C*0802. This gene is involved in antigen presentation, a process through which an antigen produced by a cell is displayed on the cell&rsquo;s outer surface and is thereby &ldquo;presented&rdquo; to the immune system. If the immune system recognizes the antigen as abnormal or foreign, an immune response against it will be mounted. In this case, because of the loss of the segment of chromosome 6, the immune system was unable to recognize the cancer cells as being abnormal, and they were able to escape immune attack and continue to thrive. Since the lesion was removed, however, the patient has been disease-free for over eight months.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This study demonstrates for the first time that this method of administering TILs, called adoptive T cell transfer immunotherapy, can mediate effective antitumor immune responses against cancers that express the KRAS G12D mutation,&rdquo; said Dr. Rosenberg. &ldquo;We have also identified multiple T cell receptors that recognize this KRAS product, thus opening the possibility of T cell receptor gene therapy against multiple types of cancer that express this common mutation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The authors of the study note that this work is a proof-of-principle and that the next step is to see if the method proves effective in other patients.</p>

<p>A comprehensive analysis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the most common type of liver cancer, has revealed several genomic changes that may represent new therapeutic targets. The incidence of HCC has risen over the last 20 years and currently has a poor 5-year overall survival rate of approximately 15 percent. There are several known risk factors for HCC, including hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, diabetes mellitus, obesity, and alcohol abuse. Currently only two drugs, the receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors sorafenib and regorafenib, are approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treating advanced HCC. In part to increase the number of potential therapeutic targets, investigators from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network identified genomic alterations in 196 tumors that influence development of HCC, including mutations in the <em>TERT</em> gene promotor, mutations in the <em>TP53</em> and <em>CTNNB1</em> (&beta;-catenin) genes, and elevated expression of several immune checkpoint genes.</p>
<p><em>TERT</em> promotor mutations were identified in 44 percent of the tumors studied. These mutations were associated with increased elongation of telomeres, protective tips on the ends of DNA strands that shorten with each cell division, ultimately limiting the number of times a cell can divide. The <em>TERT</em> promotor mutations were also strongly associated with silencing of the <em>CDKN2A</em> gene, a tumor suppressor gene whose protein product helps regulate the cell cycle. Together, these findings suggest that both alterations contribute to the immortality of HCC cells and that telomerase inhibitors, which are currently undergoing clinical testing, may help reverse this immortality. The <em>TP53</em> gene, which is the most commonly mutated gene in cancer and encodes a tumor suppressor protein that also helps regulate the cell cycle, was mutated in 31 percent of the tumors studied, suggesting that these tumors may respond to targeted restoration of <em>TP53</em> activity, a strategy currently under development. In addition, the researchers found that some tumors with normal <em>TP53</em> genes exhibited low <em>TP53</em> expression and overexpression of another gene, <em>MDM4</em>, whose protein product binds to TP53 protein and blocks its activity; small molecule inhibitors of MDM4 protein are currently available. Mutations in another significantly mutated gene, <em>CTNNBB1</em>, identified in 26 percent of the tumors studied, might be targeted with Wnt signaling pathway inhibitors, which are currently in development. Finally, 20 percent of HCC tumors had high levels of immune cells infiltrating the tumor and elevated expression of the immune checkpoint genes <em>CTLA4</em>, <em>PD-1</em>, and <em>PD-L1.</em> Given the recent success of immune checkpoint inhibitors in several cancer types, these therapies may be able to increase the responsiveness of a subset of HCCs to attack by the immune system. Findings from this TCGA Research Network study, led by David A.

<p>Today, the National Cancer Institute (NCI), part of the National Institutes of Health, announced a Blue Ribbon Panel of scientific experts, cancer leaders, and patient advocates that will inform the scientific direction and goals at NCI of Vice President Joe Biden&rsquo;s National Cancer Moonshot Initiative. The panel will serve as a working group of the presidentially appointed National Cancer Advisory Board (NCAB) and will provide scientific guidance from thought-leaders in the cancer community.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Blue Ribbon Panel will ensure that, as NIH allocates new resources through the Moonshot, decisions will be grounded in the best science,&rdquo; said the Vice President. &ldquo;I look forward to working with this panel and many others involved with the Moonshot to make unprecedented improvements in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Over the next several months, the panel will consider how to advance the themes that have been proposed for the initiative. The themes include the development of cancer vaccines, highly sensitive approaches to early detection, advances in immunotherapy and combination therapies, single-cell genomic profiling of cancer cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment, enhanced data sharing, and new approaches to the treatment of pediatric cancers.</p>
<p>In addition, the cancer community, including the American public, will be provided a forum to post comments and insights to help inform the panel&rsquo;s deliberations. Findings of the panel will be reported to the NCAB, which in turn will make its recommendations to NCI and contribute to the overall approach of the initiative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thanks to advances in science, we are now in a historically unique position to make profound improvements in the way we treat, detect, and prevent cancer,&rdquo; said NIH Director Francis S. Collins, M.D., Ph.D. &ldquo;The Vice President&rsquo;s deep personal commitment to this noble cause will make a tremendous difference in our ability to lift the terrible burden of cancer. His call to action, including the establishment of this panel, comes at just the right time for all the right reasons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Vice President&rsquo;s enthusiasm about this effort is welcomed by the community of researchers, health professionals, and patients who share his passion and belief that great things are possible by accelerating cancer research with leadership and resources,&rdquo; said NCI Acting Director Douglas Lowy, M.D. &ldquo;We are committed to breaking down silos and stimulating the groundbreaking work already underway. To be successful, we must hear a broad range of perspectives to take full advantage of the exceptional current opportunities in cancer research.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Blue Ribbon Panel members represent a spectrum of scientific areas, including biology, immunology, genomics, diagnostics, bioinformatics, and cancer prevention and treatment. Scientific members also include investigators with expertise in clinical trials and cancer health disparities. Importantly, the members of cancer advocacy groups and pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies will be represented on the panel and its working groups.</p>
