    <intro><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>Cancer is not one disease, but a collection of related diseases that can occur almost anywhere in the body. At its most basic, cancer is a disease of the genes in the cells of our body. Genes control the way our cells work. But, changes to these genes can cause cells to malfunction, causing them to grow and divide when they should not&mdash;or preventing them from dying when they should. These abnormal cells can become cancer.</p>
<p>Understanding how genetic changes cause cancer is one way to understand this disease, while cancer statistics is another. Cancer statistics help scientists understand the burden of cancer on society. Statistics can tell us things such as how many people are diagnosed with and die from cancer each year and the number of people who are living after a cancer diagnosis. Changes in statistics over time can help scientists find areas where progress is needed.</p>
<p>Cancer statistics also help scientists understand cancer health disparities. Examples of disparities&nbsp;include the higher cancer death rates, less frequent use of proven screening tests, and higher rates of advanced cancer diagnoses that are found in certain groups of people.</p>

<p>A primary goal of the RAS Initiative at the Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR) is to develop assays for RAS activity, localization, and signaling and adapt those assays so they can be used for finding new drug candidates. The assays are of two broad types: in vitro assays that use purified proteins and in vivo assays that use live cells. Adapting assays for use in screening campaigns requires that all aspects of each assay be thoroughly understood and controlled, so that tens or hundreds of thousands of data points can be confidently assessed. The end products are highly validated screening protocols that can be applied by partner organizations to their own libraries of small molecules or natural products.</p>

<p>The Division of Cancer Biology (DCB) supports basic research in all areas of cancer biology at academic institutions and research foundations across the United States. As part of the National Cancer Institute, DCB provides funding for research that investigates the basic biology behind cancer.</p>
<p>Research in the field of basic cancer biology focuses on the mechanisms that underlie fundamental processes such as cell growth, the transformation of normal cells to cancer cells, and the spread, or metastasis, of cancer cells. This research provides the building blocks to new treatments, clinical trials, and improved understanding of the disease. Basic research has enabled much of the progress made over the years in the search for a cure for cancer.</p>

    <intro><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>The Office of Government and Congressional Relations (OGCR), formerly the Office of Policy Analysis and Response (OPAR), was established in the early 1990's. Its initial responsibility was to advise the NCI Director, staff, and advisory boards on legislative and Congressional activities as they relate to the&nbsp;NCI mission.</p>
<p>OGCR's duties have since expanded and today its functions cut across all levels of the NCI structure.</p>
<p>OGCR currently provides NCI and its constituents with&nbsp;three essential services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Coordinate, monitor, and analyze congressional activities</li>
<li>Review, process, and respond to all requests for information from NCI that fall under the jurisdiction of the Freedom of Information (FOIA) and Privacy Act</li>
<li>Serve as NCI's liaison for all U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) and DHHS Office of Inspector General investigations</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, OGCR facilitates the relationships between NCI, the Congress, and the general public.</p>
<p>OGCR aims to ensure that the NCI community is kept abreast of the congressional issues and interests that affect the Institute, and in turn NIH. OGCR also works closely with other offices both at the Institute and agency level.</p>
<p>Since NCI is a federally funded institute within NIH and ultimately DHHS, we are part of the executive branch of government. As such, we are non-partisan and do not lobby or endorse members of Congress or legislation.</p>

    <intro><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>Cancer can cause many different symptoms. Most often these symptoms are not caused by cancer, but by benign tumors or other problems. If you have symptoms that last for a couple of weeks, your doctor will do a physical exam and order tests or other procedures to find out what is causing your symptoms.</p>
<p>If you do find out you have cancer, your doctor will order another set of tests or procedures to figure out its stage. Stage refers to the extent of your cancer and is based on factors such as how large the tumor is and if it has spread. Once your doctor knows the stage of your cancer, he will be able to suggest treatment and discuss your prognosis with you. Understanding your cancer and knowing what to expect can help you and your loved ones feel more in control and cope with your diagnosis.</p>

<p>The Interagency Oncology Task Force Fellowship program trains scientists in research and research-related regulatory review, policies, and regulations to develop a skill set that bridges the two disparate processes. Fellows learn to build awareness of regulatory requirements into the early stages of the medical product development process and will develop strategies to improve planning throughout research and regulatory review.</p>
<p>The fellowship is offered as a partnership of the National Cancer Institute (NCI), National Institutes of Health (NIH), and U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the U.S. Department Health and Human Services (HHS).</p>
<p>*Selection of fellows will be dependent upon the availabilty of funds.</p>

    <intro><![CDATA[<div class="rxbodyfield">
<p>The Tumor Microenvironment Network, or TMEN, was a program launched by the NCI in 2006 (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-06-014.html" target="_blank">RFA CA06-014</a>) and&nbsp;reissued in 2010 (<a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-10-021.html" target="_blank">RFA CA10-021</a>)&nbsp;that funded research in basic cancer biology to study the mechanisms of tumor-host interactions in human cancer. The initiative funded 20 collaborative Center grants across the country and 10 collaborative U01 grants&nbsp;that brought&nbsp;together a TMEN key&nbsp;investigator and scientists with expertise in other biological systems or&nbsp;organ sites not yet being modeled or studied within TMEN to form a new project in tumor microenvironment research. Better understanding the mechanisms of a tumor&rsquo;s interaction with its surrounding environment was achieved by: generating a comprehensive understanding of stromal composition; understanding the role of stroma in normal tissues; and discerning the role of stroma in tumor initiation, progression and metastases, as well as responses to treatment.</p>
<p>TMEN was designed as an infrastructure that established repositories of critical reagents, resources and information to promote and facilitate interdisciplinary collaborations and progress in understanding the role of the tumor microenvironment. Through this initiative, the&nbsp;NCI&rsquo;s&nbsp;Division of Cancer Biology supported research that led to a more comprehensive understanding of the composition of the stroma in normal tissues and advanced the field by furthering scientific understanding regarding the mechanisms of tumor-stromal interactions in human cancer.<span>&nbsp;</span></p>

</div>
<p>Research in the field of basic cancer biology focuses on the mechanisms that underlie fundamental processes such as cell growth, the transformation of normal cells to cancer cells, and the spread, or metastasis, of cancer cells. This research provides the building blocks to new treatments and clinical trials.</p>
<p>DCB supports a broad range of investigator-initiated research in its mission to facilitate existing and emerging research areas in basic cancer biology. The grants DCB funds each year investigate the biological aspects of every form of cancer. The research ranges from targeted, long-term studies that are revealing the molecular details of cell processes, to high-risk, yet scientifically sound, innovative research approaches that hold great promise for providing key insights into tumor development.</p>

<p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) aims to make important discoveries that improve health and save lives. Genomic research supports this mission by helping to advance our understanding of factors that influence health and disease. Sharing genomic research data is essential for translating research results into knowledge, products, and procedures that improve human health.</p>
<p>NCI supports and complies with all NIH data sharing policies. <a href="https://osp.od.nih.gov/scientific-sharing/policies/">The NIH Genomic Data Sharing (GDS) Policy</a> was issued to:</p>
<ul>
<li>promote broad and robust sharing of human and non-human data from a wide range of genomic research</li>
<li>ensure appropriate protections for research involving human data and oversight of research conduct, data quality, data management, data sharing, and data use</li>
</ul>
<p>The <a href="https://datascience.cancer.gov/about/organization">NCI Office of Data Sharing</a> supports the Genomic Data Sharing Policy by enhancing the accessibility and utility of research data and creating education resources to guide the cancer community through the data sharing process.</p>
<p>For questions about the policy, email the <a href="mailto:nciofficeofdatasharing@nih.gov">NCI Office of Data Sharing</a>. For NCI-specific questions regarding the policy, contact the Program Director first, followed by the Genomic Program Administrator (GPA) or the GPA assistant in the appropriate NCI division or center.</p>
