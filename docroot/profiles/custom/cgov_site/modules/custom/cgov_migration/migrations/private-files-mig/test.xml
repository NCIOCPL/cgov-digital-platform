Our pilot project data, which forms the basis of this proposal, showed that Kenyan children metabolize vincristine much more efficiently than American (primarily Caucasian) children due to genetic polymorphisms in CYP3A5. The faster metabolism of vincristine in Kenyan children results in less toxicity in this population, but it likely also negatively impacts overall cancer-related survival. It is our hope that the information gained from the research funded by this proposal will ultimately allow us to determine the best dose for each individual patient, enabling oncologists around the world to maximize survival while simultaneously limiting toxic side-effects associated with this life-saving chemotherapy.<br style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" />&#160;</p><ul><li><b>Cancer Bioinformatics Network in the Central America LMICS: Gastric Cancer Focus</b></li></ul><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1906&amp;sys_revision=5&amp;sys_contentid=352434&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="352434" sys_dependentvariantid="1906" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4719174" sys_siteid="305">Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center</a>; <a href="http://www.salud.gob.sv">Ministry of Health, El Salvador</a>; <a href="http://www.salud.gob.hn">Ministry of Health Honduras</a></p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">The primary aim of this proposed program is to establish a cancer informatics infrastructure in Central America, building upon the established Vanderbilt cancer research infrastructure and professional relationships within the respective Ministries of Health (MOH). The central scientific focus is gastric cancer, with the establishment of a permanent regional clinicopathology registry (Aim 1). The core infrastructure component herein is the creation of a standard regional cancer registry, based upon the International Agency for Cancer Research (IARC) standards (Aim 2). The initial geographic focus in this proposal is the contiguous area of western Honduras and El Salvador, the central region of the CA-4. The cancer informatics partnership with Vanderbilt would provide the foundation for a series of future initiatives: geographic extension (e.g., Nicaragua, Guatemala), bioinformatics extension (e.g., biorepository and pathology capacity building), and research and cancer control (e.g., gastric cancer epidemiology and prevention).

With improved survival following effective antiretroviral therapy (ART), liver disease, including HCC, has become a leading cause of death among HIV-infected persons in Western cohorts, mostly affecting those co-infected with HBV or HCV. The recent scale-up of ART among HIV-infected populations in Africa has translated into dramatic survival benefit. Paradoxically, as HIV-infected persons survive longer, the burden of HCC is expected to increase substantially in aging African populations with endemic HBV, sporadic HCV, and generalized HIV. In prior collaborations, Drs. Kirk and Ocama have documented increasing HCC incidence rates in Uganda and a high prevalence of liver fibrosis associated with HIV, and documented the feasibility of conducting high-level research on HCC and HIV. Building on existing collaboration between Johns Hopkins/SKCCC and the Makerere University, Uganda Cancer Institute (UCI), Infectious Disease Institute (IDI), and NIAID&#8217;s International Center for Excellence in Research (ICER) in Uganda, the aims of this proposal include:</p><p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;"><br />1.

The first is to expand our collaboration with two cancer symposia at OAU titled &#8220;Colorectal cancer: Partnerships for research and clinical care.&#8221; These symposia will utilize faculty from MSKCC and OAU. In addition, there will be a 3-month fellowship (funded by an existing fellowship at MSKCC) for a junior surgeon at OAU to learn additional research and clinical skills to use in treating cancer patients in Nigeria. The second goal is to create a regional network of Nigerian cancer investigators to prospectively acquire demographic, radiologic, and pathologic presentations of patients with colorectal cancer in Nigeria. Patients from four hospitals will be accrued for this protocol. We anticipate obtaining detailed prospective demographic, environmental, dietary, radiographic, pathologic, therapeutic, and outcomes data on approximately 150 patients with colorectal cancer. These data will be analyzed with the MSKCC team and presented at the second symposium. They will be a platform for future prospective studies that will engage the clinical investigators at all four Nigerian hospitals and take advantage of our faculty and research resources as MSKCC.<br style=" margin-left: 20.0px;" />&#160;</p><ul><li><b>A Study of Etiology of Esophageal Cancer in Tanzania (SEEC-TANZANIA)</b></li></ul><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1906&amp;sys_revision=3&amp;sys_contentid=352627&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="352627" sys_dependentvariantid="1906" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4719177" sys_siteid="305">UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>; <a href="http://www.muchs.ac.tz">Muhimbili University (Tanzania)</a></p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">This project focuses the expertise of UCSF and HDFCCC in the area of global health on the problem of esophageal cancer (EC) and its suspected high incidence in Eastern Africa.

The Pain &amp; Policy Studies Group (PPSG), based at the University of Wisconsin Carbone Cancer Center (UWCCC), will collaborate with the African Palliative Care Association (APCA) to administer the fellowship for five practitioners, or in country &#8220;champions,&#8221; who will act as change agents. The project builds on a Fellowship program offered from the U.S., aimed at training champions from a variety of LMICs; its success will facilitate the broader global dissemination of the IPPF through the use of regional collaborations throughout the world and will serve to increase the capacity of the APCA and its member countries to improve palliative care in Africa.<br />&#160;</p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">This new approach for conducting the IPPF program has several key advantages over the current U.S. based, PPSG-led, largely email-focused model. First, involving a local partner organization (i.e., APCA) will contribute vital knowledge and experience about local traditions, beliefs, cultures, and political situations and how these might affect opioid availability and palliative care. Coupling this information with PPSG&#8217;s policy and technical expertise will result in identifying solutions that are most feasible and effective given each country&#8217;s unique characteristics. Second, Fellows from the same region often share common experiences related to opioid availability and face similar challenges. Bringing PPSG staff, together with Fellows, staff, and International Expert Collaborators (IEC) from Africa will facilitate finding solutions to the common challenges and will increase the likelihood of sustainable partnerships and a sense of ownership of the accomplishments. Finally, geographic proximity will make communication and in-country visits more practicable and affordable. Being surrounded by others with a shared mission will serve to elevate the enthusiasm and commitment as they approach their defined goals. Their efforts in the future will benefit from knowing more colleagues who are addressing the same opioid availability issues, thereby expanding their networking abilities, leading to further progress to address barriers, and leading to increased and positive future communications and assistance with other countries.</p><p>&#160;</p><ul><li><b>St. Jude Comprehensive Cancer Center &#8211; Pequeno Principe Research Institute Twinning Program</b></li></ul><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1906&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_contentid=352409&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="352409" sys_dependentvariantid="1906" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4719180" sys_siteid="305">St Jude Children&#8217;s Research Hospital Comprehensive Cancer Center</a>; <a href="http://www.golspelavida.org.br/instituto.en.php">Pele Pequeno Principe Research Institute</a></p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">The project is designed to assist investigators at the Pel&#233; Pequeno Pr&#237;ncipe Research Institute in Curitiba, Brazil in establishing a state-of-the-art biobank and cancer registry.

More specifically, the proposed study addresses the NCI objective to establish a biorepository with supportive database management to adapt best practices to facilities in a LMIC. The importance of building this research capacity in Curitiba is founded in the recent study by St. Jude and Pel&#233; Pequeno Pr&#237;ncipe Research Institute investigators that identified a germline TP53 mutation in one in every 375 individuals in Southern Brazil within a total population of 70 million individuals (~200,000 carriers).

A similar situation existed in the U.S. prior to the wide dissemination of cytology-based cervical cancer screening in the 1960s when cervical cancer incidence in 10 select metropolitan areas in 1947-1948 (40.1 in whites and 73.1 in nonwhites) were the same order of magnitude as the highest rates found in Eastern Africa today.</p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">2. The costly and complex nature of Pap smear screening, coupled with very porous health delivery systems, present insurmountable barriers to the successful implementation of this mode of cervical cancer prevention in resource-poor settings.</p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">3. In response to the challenge of cervical cancer screening in sub-Saharan Africa the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, working through the Center for Infectious Disease Research in Zambia (CIDRZ) is extending their established cervical cancer prevention service platform in Zambia using visual screening techniques i.e. visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) and digital cervicography (DC).</p><p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">&#8226; <b>Aim 1:</b> To build cervical cancer screening and treatment capacity in Malawi, with clinical platforms in both countries serving as recruitment and training centers for future research activities.<br />&#8226; <b>Aim 2:</b> To establish bio-repositories at both sites, which will store high-value (frozen biopsies) specimens for genomic, transcriptomic, and eventual proteomic analyses.&#160;</p><p style=" margin-left: 40.0px;">&#160;</p><ul><li><b>Expanding Capacity for Infection &#8211; Related Cancer Research by Examining the Contribution of Viral Genomic Diversity to the Clinical Manifestations of Cancer in Uganda</b></li></ul><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=1906&amp;sys_revision=4&amp;sys_contentid=352620&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="352620" sys_dependentvariantid="1906" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="4719182" sys_siteid="305">Fred Hutchinson University of Washington Cancer Consortium</a>; <a href="http://www.uci.or.ug">Uganda Cancer Institute</a></p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;">This project will concurrently address an issue of public health importance in low/middle income countries (LMIC), the contribution of viral oncogene genomic diversity to the clinical manifestations of infection-related cancers, and also build capacity in physical infrastructure and cancer research at our LMIC partner, the UCI.

We propose to select one Ugandan physician-scientist with interest in the conduct and analysis of genomic experiments (Dr. Fred Okuku) to come to Seattle for a period of 6 months to conduct an internship in the analysis of viral genomic data. First, we propose that Dr. Okuku will enroll in didactic coursework at the University of Washington&#8217;s (UW) outstanding Genome Sciences program (GENOME 552 Technologies for Genome Analysis and GENOME 540 Introductions to Computational Molecular Biology: Genome and Protein Sequence Analysis). This educational work is covered under an established Memorandum of Understanding between the UCI/Hutchinson Center Alliance and the UW. Second, Dr. Okuku will work with Dr. Delrow of the FHCRC Sequencing Shared Resource to conduct the NextGen assays required for the generation of sequence data for Specific Aim 1. Finally, Dr. Okuku will work with the newly-hired Staff Scientist with expertise in genomics and the Computational Biology Core Director at FHCRC, Dr. Martin McIntosh, to analyze the genomic data he helped to generate.

<p>The three human <i>RAS</i> genes encode four highly related RAS proteins (82-90% sequence identity), with alternative gene splicing accounting for the expression of the highly related K-RAS4A and K-RAS4B proteins (90% identity). There is an emerging perception that the roles and functions of specific RAS proteins in cancer are distinct and, consequently, distinct anti-RAS strategies will be needed for effective inhibition of each RAS protein. Here we review the mutational frequency of the three <i>RAS</i> genes in human cancers and their ability to induce cancer in specific tissues.</p>
<p>Of the three mammalian <i>RAS</i> genes, only <i>HRAS</i> and <i>KRAS</i> were identified originally as the cellular counterparts of the viral oncogenes of acute transforming Harvey and Kirsten sarcoma retroviruses (Cox and Der, 2010). <i>NRAS</i> joined the family only after its detection in an NIH 3T3 focus formation assay to detect activated oncogenes in genomic DNA isolated from a human neuroblastoma cell line. Historically, despite the more prevalent mutation frequencies of <i>KRAS</i> and <i>NRAS</i> in human cancers, <i>HRAS</i> has been the most intensively studied. This focus was due in part to the greater availability of reagents to study HRAS and to the assumption that the functions of all four RAS proteins were largely equivalent. Thus, much of our understanding of RAS protein structure, biochemistry, and biology comes from the study of HRAS. Only with the unexpected and disappointing discovery that KRAS4B and NRAS escaped the action of farnesyltransferase inhibitors by undergoing alternate prenylation did attention begin to shift to KRAS, and, in particular, the KRAS 4B isoform. Interestingly, it is the still largely ignored KRAS4A isoform that is encoded by the original Kirsten murine sarcoma virus.</p>
<p>The frequency of mutation of each <i>RAS</i> gene varies widely in different cancer types. In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) there is a near 100% frequency of <i>KRAS</i> mutations (Figure 1.) This contrasts with cutaneous melanoma or acute myelogenous leukemia (AML), where <i>NRAS</i> comprises 94% and 59%, respectively, of RAS mutations in these cancers. Conversely, mutations of <i>KRAS</i> and <i>NRAS</i> are seen at near equivalent frequencies in multiple myeloma (MM). Although rare overall (1-3% of all human cancers), <i>HRAS</i> mutations are predominant in bladder urothelial (57%) and head and neck squamous cell (HNSCC; 86%) carcinomas.</p>
<p>Why the frequency of <i>RAS</i> gene mutations varies widely in cancers that arise from different tissues remains largely unresolved. One logical assumption is that a specific <i>RAS</i> isoform is favored simply by level of expression. However, the preferential mutation of <i>KRAS</i> versus <i>NRAS</i> in colorectal carcinoma (CRC) cannot be explained simply on this basis. <i>NRAS</i> (Haigis et al., 2008) and <i>HRAS</i> (Schuhmacher et al., 2008) are both expressed in mouse colonic cells, yet <i>KRAS</i> mutations are six times more common than <i>NRAS</i>, and <i>HRAS</i> mutations are not found in CRC.</p>
<p>Another possible basis for these variations is that the different <i>RAS</i> genes exhibit different potencies in driving cancers from different tissues. This possibility is supported by genetically engineered mouse model analyses in which mutant <i>KRAS</i> G12D but not <i>NRAS</i> G12D caused colon cancer progression in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)-deficient colonic epithelial cells (Haigis et al., 2008). Interestingly, although colon and rectal cancers are generally described as a single cancer type, a recent study found that <i>NRAS</i> mutations were associated with rectal versus colon cancer (12.5% versus 0.6%, respectively) (Russo et al., 2014), supporting distinct roles for <i>RAS</i> isoforms in driving cancer from different tissues.</p>
<p>Another possibility is that the carcinogenic assault and efficiency of DNA repair that each tissue faces will favor the mutational activation of a specific <i>RAS</i> gene. This possibility was tested in several mouse models of carcinogen-induced <i>RAS</i> gene mutation and cancer induction. One study used the widely utilized two-stage skin carcinogenesis model (<a href="https://nciphub.org/groups/rascentral/blog/2014/04/a">7,12-dimethyl-benz anthracene</a>; DMBA)/ phorbol ester 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13 acetate; TPA). The DMBA/TPA carcinogenesis regimen results in <i>HRAS</i> Q61L mutation and formation of skin papillomas. In squamous cell carcinomas, <i>HRAS</i> is the predominant isoform mutated (8%), followed by <i>KRAS</i> (3%) and <i>NRAS</i> (2%) (Catalogue of Somatic Mutations In Cancer [COSMIC] database). When applied to <i>HRAS</i>-null mice, <i>KRAS</i> mutation (G12, G13 or Q61) and skin papilloma formation occurred, albeit at a sixfold lower frequency (Ise et al., 2000). This result suggested that sensitivity to DNA mutagenesis, rather than a requirement for activation of a specific RAS protein, is a basis for RAS isoform preference in cancer induction from a particular tissue.</p>
<p>Another study addressed this question by using a urethane carcinogenesis model in which treatment of mice with this carcinogen causes <i>KRAS</i> mutation and lung tumor formation. <i>KRAS</i> mutation represents 96% of <i>RAS</i> mutations in human lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) (Figure 1.) When applied to a mouse with the <i>HRAS</i> coding sequence under control of the <i>KRAS</i> allele (i.e., <i>HRAS</i> replaced <i>KRAS</i> in the <i>KRAS</i> genomic locus), <i>HRAS</i> mutation-driven lung tumors occurred, and at a higher frequency than seen with wild-type mice (To et al., 2008). These results suggest that <i>KRAS</i> regulatory elements, rather than the encoded protein, was a basis for the preference of <i>KRAS</i> mutation in lung tumor formation.</p>
<p>Although <i>NRAS</i> is the predominant <i>RAS</i> mutation (94%) found in human cutaneous melanoma (Chin et. al., 1997), melanocyte-specific expression of activated <i>HRAS</i> G12V and <i>KRAS</i> G12D can drive melanoma formation in mice (Table 1).</p>
<p>More recently, a provocative finding by Counter and colleagues was the predominance of rare codons in the <i>KRAS</i> gene relative to <i>HRAS</i>, resulting in reduced translation and expression of KRAS protein (Lampson et al., 2013). When the <i>KRAS</i> gene was codon optimized, this enhanced both KRAS protein expression and transforming activity when tested in various cell lines. These results prompted the hypothesis that, since mutant <i>RAS</i> causes senescence in normal cells, <i>KRAS</i> is preferentially mutated in cancer because its mutational activation is better tolerated in preneoplastic tissue. However, this cannot explain why <i>NRAS</i> or <i>HRAS</i> is preferentially mutated in other cancer types (Figure 1.) Furthermore, the suggestion that activated HRAS protein causes a greater degree of senescence in normal tissue is at odds with the existence of germline <i>HRAS</i> G12S/A mutations in Costello syndrome individuals (Rauen, 2013). Additionally, mice with a germline <i>HRAS</i> G12V mutation were born at the expected Mendelian ratio, were fertile, and survived at rates comparable to wild-type mice (Schuhmacher et al., 2008).</p>
<p>In summary, why a specific <i>RAS</i> isoform is preferentially mutated in specific cancers remains to be understood. While experimental and correlative studies argue for different reasons, perhaps there is some truth to all these causes, and, additionally, more causes that remain to be discovered. Whether this will translate to the need for RAS isoform-selective therapies will also be an issue that will not be answered until effective anti-RAS therapies are finally developed.</p>

<p>Welcome to the RAS Initiative on Cancer.gov.</p>
<p>Since I published my first paper on RAS a long while ago, our knowledge of RAS and its partners in illegitimate signaling has grown tremendously, but as you are aware we have yet to convert that knowledge into any drugs that directly target the RAS protein. We have struggled to integrate what we know of how RAS signals with the heterogeneity seemingly inherent in solid tumors and the subtle differences in the behavior of different <i>RAS</i> mutants, among many, many aspects of the RAS problem.</p>
<p>RAS Central is part of a concerted effort, led by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and its director, Dr. Harold Varmus, and me, to improve this state of affairs. The RAS Initiative at the NCI Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research (FNLCR), in Frederick, Maryland, is redirecting existing technology resources established by the NCI over the past decade to concentrate on eight different aspects of RAS. However, it is our vision and hope that the RAS Initiative will face outward and encourage collaboration in the large community of scientists (estimated at more than 1,500 labs worldwide) that work on the RAS pathways every day.</p>
<p>RAS Central is a major piece of that outreach. Within RAS Central you will be able to pose questions, give and seek advice on reagents and techniques, connect with other members of the RAS community, and read and respond to commentaries by leaders in the field.</p>
<p>Please join us to facilitate and expand open communications within the RAS community. I&rsquo;m looking forward to working with you.</p>

This endoscope will be portable and battery operated with a fiber optic imaging system. The whole system will be optimized, validated and incorporated into a mobile diagnostic and treatment unit and field tested in Brazil in a mobile clinic. This device will provide cervical cancer screening and diagnosis to areas with no access to real-time screening and where the normally used methods (pap smear) are not available and impractical, leaving women with very few options for diagnosis of a cancer that is preventable and treatable if diagnosed early.</p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><b>Adaptation and testing of the&#160;</b><i><b>CryoPen</b></i><b>&#160;cryotherapy device for treating cervical neoplasia for use in low-income settings</b>: Investigators will adapt the CryoPen, which is used to treat cervical cancer by freezing suspicious lesions, into an inexpensive and easily transportable device (powered by car batteries) for use in low and middle income countries by healthcare workers with minimal training. The CryoPen draws heat from the cervical tissue causing freezing and crystallization of the intracellular water, producing death of the tumor cells. The investigators have established collaborations to validate and deploy the CryoPen in Peru and Columbia.</p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><b>Adapting the Cepheid GeneXpert test to detect HPV</b>: Partnering with Cepheid, a major diagnostics manufacturer, and investigators from the University of Cape Town, the Kuhn team seeks to determine if a diagnostic that detects diverse HPV genes can be adapted to distinguish invasive carcinoma from inconsequential cervical neoplasms.&#160; If successful, this project will not only adapt a simple technology to a third world country but also determine how the diverse population of South Africa differs from that of Europe and the United States and contribute to better utilization of medical resources to treat cervical carcinoma.</p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><b>Low-cost test for hepatitis C virus to identify patients at risk for developing hepatocellular carcinoma</b>: The device developed in this project will aid in identifying patients at risk of developing HCC, and in monitoring treatment outcomes of the viral infection.&#160; A tiered pricing for hepatitis drugs for use in LMICs negotiated by NGOs, making the drugs available at a fraction of the cost in the USA, along with the availability of the low cost technologies developed in the proposal to detect active viral infection will prevent progression of hepatitis to HCC, and significantly reduce HCC incidence.</p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><b>Assessing the performance, safety, and efficacy of a new cryotherapy device using liquid CO2</b>: Teams from Johns Hopkins University, &#160;the international clinical research organization, Jhpiego, and the Cancer Institute Foundation in the Philippines will determine whether a novel low cost cryosurgery device driven by liquid CO<sub>2</sub> can treat cervical dysplasia, the premalignant lesion that leads to invasive carcinoma.&#160; Dr. Anderson&#8217;s approach is novel because liquid CO<sub>2</sub> is widely available in LMICs for such carbonated beverages as Coca-Cola and Pepsi.&#160; The device achieves temperatures as low as those achieved with liquid nitrogen devices, which are very expensive.&#160;&#160; If successful, this project will insure a lower cost approach to ablation of neoplasia, a major health hazard in the Philippines.</p><p style=" margin-left: 20.0px;"><b>Low-cost, portable computer-aided detection and diagnostic (CADD) tools for non-invasive screening of breast cancer</b>: The CADD system will be used to locate and distinguish between clearly benign and potentially malignant palpable breast lumps in premenopausal women in Mexico. Novel algorithms will be developed to enhance ultrasound images and to enable CADD. These algorithms will be combined with low-cost portable ultrasound transducers and hardware platforms (including mobile phones and tablets). The goal of the overall technology is to enable minimally-trained health care workers to hold the ultrasound probe over the palpable lesion and tell the woman whether she should obtain a biopsy.</p><p>While the treatment of cancer in LMICs is challenging, early detection and minimally invasive treatments are more likely to yield successful outcomes.&#160; Through this opportunity, CGH is able to support the development of low-cost, portable technologies, which have the potential to increase early&#160;detection, diagnosis, and non- or minimally-invasive treatment of cancer, for LMICs.</p><p>NCI has announced a Notice of Intent to Publish a re-issuance of this funding opportunity.&#160; For more information, see <a href="http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-14-055.html">NOT-CA-14-055</a>.</p></div>]]></row>

<p>Cancers that develop in children are often different from those diagnosed in adults, and usually are a result of DNA changes that naturally happen throughout a child's growth periods, and sometimes, even before they are born. Thus, efforts to identify successful and effective treatments for this vulnerable group require a specific focus at the molecular level to aid in understanding childhood cancers.</p>
<p>Harold Newton "Bo" Lovvorn, III, M.D., Assistant Professor of Pediatric Surgery at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, a&nbsp;<a href="http://crchd.cancer.gov/students/opportunities.html" target="_blank">CRCHD R21 workforce diversity grantee</a>&nbsp;, is taking his pediatric cancer research even further - to include child cancer patients from underrepresented ethnic backgrounds. In so doing, he is seeking to ensure that pediatric cancer health research will be beneficial to all children, regardless of background.</p>
<p>Lovvorn's research focuses particularly on&nbsp;<a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=1834&amp;sys_revision=118&amp;sys_variantid=990&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" sys_dependentvariantid="990" sys_dependentid="1834" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="6207012">Wilms Tumor&nbsp;(WT)</a>, also known as nephroblastoma, which forms in the kidneys and often metastasizes to the lung, and sometimes to the liver. While most children survive from the rare kidney cancer (only 500 cases are diagnosed in the U.S. per year), there still remains a group of children who suffer from the disease at higher rates than others. Children of black sub-Saharan African ancestry are affected most commonly from the disease.</p>
<p>"Wilms Tumor has been recognized as a&nbsp;<a inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="828658" sys_dependentvariantid="734" sys_relationshipid="6207010" sys_siteid="305">cancer health disparity</a>&nbsp;in the United States for decades," Lovvorn said, "[It] occurs more commonly in black children of sub-Saharan African ancestry than white children. [While] the survival gap has nearly closed, rates in incidence have not changed. Why is that? What is the biology behind this childhood cancer disparity? That's what we're trying to investigate in our research."</p>
<p>Lovvorn has spent the past 14 years in basic and translational research seeking to identify new treatments of Wilms Tumor for young cancer patients. Through his R21 grant, "Molecular Analysis of Ethnic Variations in WT," Lovvorn is investigating an answer to the driving question of "Are there biological differences between WT of White and Black children in North America?" Lovvorn explained, "Our goal is to identify protein signatures in both groups of patients. If the protein is different from one group to another, perhaps those tumors have activation of various resistant genes to chemotherapies, for example. This is an initial step to personalize therapy and treatment for this disease, beginning with the genetics of one's ethnicity."</p>
<p>Lovvorn targeted Kenyan children for his research because he "wanted a more isolated population that was vulnerable and resource-restrained." He further explained, "It gave us a more focused signature of what a sub-Saharan African WT looks like, and we can see how similar it is in or different from African American children in the States."</p>
<p>Lovvorn's initial research confirmed that there is indeed a cancer health disparity, but his team was surprised. "We found that the most disparate observation occurred between Kenyan black children and American black children, and that protein signatures in Whites fell somewhere in between." Subsequently, Lovvorn completed one of the first "next generation sequencing genomic analysis" of mutations in 10 genes associated with WT development and biology in Kenya specimens &ndash; including WT1, IGF2, WTX, CTNNB1, and p53, among others of biologic interest. His findings are now being validated by population geneticists at Vanderbilt.</p>
<p>Lovvorn's research has shown that different ethnic populations of patients have tumors composed of unique proteins that could drive the disparity observed between North American and African children. Further, these unique signatures could represent targets of new, race-specific drugs forming the basis to personalized treatment.</p>
<p>To investigate this disparity further, Lovvorn's current R21 research aims "to explain a pediatric cancer health disparity at the molecular level." He continued, "through the R21 mechanism, we've been able to initiate genomic analysis to try to clarify the ideology of the disparity. NCI has been overly generous to provide funds to support this work. And it creates an opportunity for future studies."</p>
<p>"There's no question that if you don't remove these [Wilms] tumors, kids don't survive. [Treatments] must be multi-modal. We need the therapy, we need the radiation, and we need the surgery all together. But we still have a 15% relapse rate. That's pretty high. When these children relapse, half of them will die."</p>
<p>"The R21 award," Lovvorn said, "has been huge to our research program. It is allowing our team to generate more data to pursue future research, and we hope to pursue an R01 next year. My hope is to move this research to potential drug discovery."</p>
<p>Lovvorn is now in the process of publishing four peer-reviewed manuscripts on the molecular epidemiology of disparities in Wilms tumor, two of which were supported directly from his R21grant. An additional manuscript, also supported by his R21, details risk factors for abandonment of WT care in Kenya, and a fourth will summarize the next generation sequencing of the Kenyan WT and kidney specimens.</p>
<p>Lovvorn received his B.S. degree in Psychology from Duke University and his medical degree from the University of Tennessee. He completed his internship and residency in General Surgery at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia, while holding a Postdoctoral Research Fellowship at the Children's Institute of Surgical Science of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. He also has completed a clinical fellowship in Pediatric General and Thoracic Surgery at LeBonheur and St. Jude Children's Hospitals in Memphis. Lovvorn is a Fellow of the American College of Surgeons, Fellow of the American Academy of Pediatrics, and a member of the American Pediatric Surgical Association.</p>

<p>Dear Colleague,</p>
<p>I have argued that during these fiscally constrained times it is particularly important to pay attention to areas of cancer research that have great inherent promise, but have been understudied, neglected, paradoxical, or considered too difficult to address in the past.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://provocativequestions.nci.nih.gov/">Provocative Questions initiative</a> has been one way to draw attention to such areas of research, using workshops to define the questions and a request for applications to try to answer them. Another way to stimulate work on important but difficult problems is to take greater advantage of the <a href="http://frederick.cancer.gov/">Frederick National Lab for Cancer Research (FNLCR)</a>, part of the NCI&rsquo;s Federally Funded Research and Development Center, operated under a contract to Leidos Biomedical Research, Inc. With help from many quarters &ndash; the <a href="https://deainfo.nci.nih.gov/advisory/fac/fac.htm">Frederick National Lab Advisory Committee (FNLAC)</a>, participants at scientific workshops, disease advocacy groups, and our contractors &ndash; we have recently developed an exciting initiative designed to study several aspects of RAS genes and proteins and ultimately provide better treatment for the many cancers driven by RAS mutations. The RAS Initiative is conducted through activities at both its &ldquo;hub&rdquo; at the FNLCR and its dispersed &ldquo;spokes,&rdquo; the scientific community that studies RAS throughout the country and the world.</p>
<p>The RAS Initiative follows the National Lab model of collaboration among government, academic, and industry researchers to attack a scientifically difficult problem of national importance, and it is the first of what I hope will be several ambitious projects fostered by the FNLCR. I have created a RAS Advisory Committee to guide our efforts on RAS and to ensure that we fully utilize the FNLCR and the entire cancer research enterprise in this program. I encourage each of you become part of the RAS community by following the progress of the RAS Initiative website.</p>
<p>I look forward to our continued work together, through the FNLCR and more traditional mechanisms.</p>
<p>Harold Varmus</p>

<p>Diplomacy can&rsquo;t happen without people, and a wonderful example of NCI&rsquo;s and CGH&rsquo;s global health diplomacy was on display during a meeting between NCI&rsquo;s Director, Dr. Harold Varmus, and <a href="http://www.narendramodi.in/">Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi</a> in New York, last week. &nbsp;&nbsp;During their meeting, both leaders expressed interest in a variety of health-related topics, including global cancer research, vaccines, as well as the state of cancer research in India. &nbsp;Dr. Varmus also shared stories of his apprenticeship with a mission hospital in Bareilly, Uttar Pradesh, India in the 1960s. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I was particularly pleased to see recognition and support for NCI&rsquo;s global efforts, as the White House released a US-India joint statement for collaboration discussed between President Obama and Prime Minister Modi. &nbsp;Included in the statement was an agreement, in principle, to &ldquo;initiate cooperative activities to increase capacity in cancer research and patient care delivery, including by developing collaborative programs for and with India's upcoming AIIMS-National Cancer Institute." &nbsp;</p>
<p>The meeting between Dr. Varmus and Prime Minister Modi has brought attention to the importance of global health diplomacy. &nbsp;Through collaborative meetings such as these, much of CGH&rsquo;s best work takes place on a face-to-face and one-to-one basis, igniting interaction between people who share a common passion for reducing cancer deaths worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;Our mission is rooted in coordination, collaboration, and communication &ndash; and Dr. Varmus and Prime Minister Modi certainly seemed to lay the groundwork for future collaboration. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Dear all,</p>
<p>We are planning a paper that presents a RAS-centric view of the data in <a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/">TCGA</a>.&nbsp; This will be a collaboration between Gaddy Getz and colleagues at the Broad, and Bob Stephens and colleagues at the Frederick National Lab and others. The aim is to provide a synopsis of expression patterns, mutations and copy number changes, and several other parameters relevant to the RAS pathway across the&nbsp; different tumor types.</p>
<p>As you all know, this pathway can be defined in various ways. For purposes of interrogating TCGA data we have used gene names from the <a href="http://cancergenome.broadinstitute.org/">Broad Tumor Portal</a>. Some may not be familiar to you. For example, I hadn&rsquo;t realized that ARHGAP35, which is mutated at quite a high frequency, is actually&nbsp; p190RhoGAP, made popular by Jeff Settleman. Matt Meyerson kindly pointed this out to me.</p>

<p>The diagram shows 118 genes arranged in 36 groups containing one to eleven genes per group. &nbsp;The proteins represented by gene names in a group are thought to carry out similar, but probably not identical, functions. Gene names separated by periods represent proteins believed to form physical complexes. At the top of the diagram "growth factors" signal through receptors and messengers to the three RAS proteins. The RAS proteins in turn signal through three alternative pathways to affect many downstream targets including TP53, RB1, and MTOR. &nbsp;Arrows represent activation signals, dotted &nbsp;"T" lines represent inhibitory signals. The bracket connecting KSR1 and KSR2 to the RAF, MAP2K, and MAPK genes represents a scaffolding function.</p>

<p>Anyway, we'd be very grateful&nbsp; if you could send suggestions for genes that we missed or errors in the pathway diagram.&nbsp; Any other suggestions for making this effort more useful would be welcome, particularly in the context of how to best share the TCGA data in the most useful way possible.</p>

<p>The Spanish word for &ldquo;cancer&rdquo; is &ldquo;c&aacute;ncer&rdquo; &ndash; they are almost exactly the same, and so are the challenges that many countries like Mexico and the United States face when it comes to cancer prevention, detection, and treatment.</p>
<p>Visit the National Cancer Institute&rsquo;s <a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=747150&amp;sys_revision=15&amp;sys_variantid=2317&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" sys_dependentvariantid="2317" sys_dependentid="747150" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="6200834">Center for Global Health</a> web site and you will see that our mission is to support cancer research and cancer control planning through the creation of sustainable international partnerships across the globe. &nbsp;Cancer does not recognize geographical boundaries, nor does our work.</p>
<p>Last week, our mission took us to Mexico.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m delighted to tell you about the visit that NCI&rsquo;s Director, Dr. Harold Varmus, made to Mexico&rsquo;s National Cancer Institute (<a href="http://incan-mexico.org/incan/incan.jsp">Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog&iacute;a</a>, or INCan) on October 23, 2014. &nbsp;Dr. Varmus joined the President of Mexico, <a href="http://en.presidencia.gob.mx/">President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto</a>, to celebrate the opening of INCan&rsquo;s new wing, Torre de Hospitalizacion. &nbsp;This event was made even more memorable as President Pe&ntilde;a is the first Mexican president to visit the facility in more than 30 years.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am pleased to share with you President Pe&ntilde;a&rsquo;s announcement on the launch of Mexico&rsquo;s new National Cancer Control Plan. &nbsp;The National Cancer Institute has been collaborating with the Mexican government and other leaders in cancer control throughout Mexico, to assist in the development of their National Cancer Control Plan for several years. &nbsp;It is because of our strong partnership with Mexico, and much collaboration to strengthen cancer research and cancer control planning for all of Latin America, that I share their excitement in the unveiling of the National Cancer Control Plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>During his trip, and in keeping with NCI&rsquo;s global mission, Dr. Varmus also participated in meetings with senior staff from INCan, the <a href="http://www.imss.gob.mx/">Instituto Mexicano del Seguro Social</a> (Mexican Institute of Social Security), as well as the Mexican Secretariat of Health to lay the groundwork for further, critically important collaborations between INCan and the NCI. &nbsp;Finally, a strong believer in attracting the next generation of cancer researchers, Dr. Varmus met with a group of Mexican students and post-docs to discuss the importance of research in advancing Mexico&rsquo;s cancer prevention, detection and treatment programs.<br /><br />As I wrote about last month in my post, &ldquo;<a href="/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_contentid=837414&amp;sys_revision=3&amp;sys_variantid=2056&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_siteid=305&amp;sys_folderid=" sys_dependentvariantid="2056" sys_dependentid="837414" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_siteid="305" sys_folderid="" sys_relationshipid="6200835">Global Health Diplomacy on Display: Dr. Varmus and Indian Prime Minister Modi,</a>&rdquo; there is no substitute for the spark of creativity ignited from face-to-face interaction and collaboration between cancer experts from different countries, something that is part of our DNA at the Center for Global Health. &nbsp;Sharing knowledge, resources, passion, and the desire to develop better outcomes for cancer patients knows no boundaries &ndash; nor does the work that we do.</p>
<p>So to Dr. Varmus, President Enrique Pe&ntilde;a Nieto, and our partners at the Instituto Nacional de Cancerolog&iacute;a in Mexico, I&rsquo;d like to say &ldquo;muchas gracias.&rdquo; &nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;m excited about the future.</p>

<p>Donita C. Brady, a research associate Senior at the Department of Pharmacology and Cancer Biology at Duke University, is investigating the role that copper plays in cell growth and tumor biology. Inspired by mentors Christopher Counter, a cancer biologist, and Dennis Thiele, a copper biologist, at Duke University, Brady has a unique interest in the way copper interacts with protein pathways, such as the <a href="http://www.cancer.gov/dictionary?cdrid=561325">BRAF</a> (a human gene that directs cell growth)-MEK-ERK pathway, which is a major target for targeted cancer therapies because the <i>BRAF</i> gene is mutated in 60 percent of melanoma cases.</p>
<p>Brady explains, &ldquo;copper is an essential metal in terms of biological life.&rdquo; In the human body, copper is found in the liver, muscle and bone. Sources of copper come from the dietary intakes of certain foods like nuts and shellfish. Under CRCHD&rsquo;s funded <a inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="848368" sys_dependentvariantid="1122" sys_folderid="848638" sys_relationshipid="6207001" sys_siteid="305">K01 Mentored Research Scientist Development Award</a>, Brady discovered that copper is a key element required in oncogenic BRAF signaling (which directs the creation of certain cancer tumors). In the case of cancer cells, mutated BRAF continually sends signals switching on the cells to grow causing tumors. &ldquo;In cancers with mutations in BRAF, the protein is always on so it&rsquo;s a little like driving a car where the accelerator is stuck and there are no brakes,&rdquo; Brady says. &ldquo;There is no signal to the cancerous cell to stop growing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What was particularly unique in Brady&rsquo;s research was her discovery that during BRAF activation (when proteins signal to cells to grow, for example), copper can reduce the activity of the proteins MEK1 and MEK2 that BRAF signals to, which then effectively slows down cancer growth. Her findings were published in the prestigious scientific journal <i>Nature</i> (see <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v509/n7501/full/nature13180.html">Copper is required for oncogenic BRAF signaling and tumorigenesis</a>). Brady presented her research findings to CRCHD&rsquo;s CURE Program Directors at the Annual <a href="http://percussion.cancer.gov/Rhythmyx/assembler/render?sys_authtype=0&amp;sys_variantid=2056&amp;sys_revision=2&amp;sys_contentid=895441&amp;sys_context=0&amp;sys_siteid=305" inlinetype="rxhyperlink" rxinlineslot="103" sys_dependentid="895441" sys_dependentvariantid="2056" sys_relationshipid="6207002" sys_siteid="305">Professional Development Workshop</a> in late June 2014.</p>
<p>Brady says the CRCHD K01 Award played an instrumental role in her career allowing her to commit time to this novel research and to fund the necessary resources to pursue her research. Brady also says that the K01 award allows her to be &ldquo;connected with CRCHD staff that have been and will continue to be very instrumental in my career as to pursue&nbsp;a full time tenured assistant professor position.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brady&rsquo;s finding has far reaching potential to direct future cancer research. &ldquo;There are obvious offshoots to this research," she says. "We can use similar experimental approaches to find out what other cancer types may or may not respond to these copper lowering drugs in combination with current standards of care and/or experimental drugs for cancer treatment (such as the <a href="https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02068079?term=trientine+duke&amp;rank=1">combination therapy of trientine with vemurafenib to treat BRAF mutated metastatic melanoma</a>).&rdquo; The Duke University Comprehensive Cancer Center is currently testing Brady&rsquo;s concept of copper reduction for the treatment of BRAF-mutation positive melanoma in a trial led by Dr. April Salama, she says.</p>
<p>There are also hints that lower levels of the protein important for copper uptake in African Americans can predispose them to different responses to the chemotherapy cisplatin. While this is not one of Brady&rsquo;s research focuses, she says, &ldquo;While not directly related to copper itself, it has been found previously that CTR1, the major transporter for copper uptake, is lower in African Americans compared to Caucasians and this may correlate with a decrease in tumor response to chemotherapy.&rdquo; The disparities research and diversity training team at CRCHD, along with Brady, are excited to see where her research will lead.</p>
<p>Brady credits her high school chemistry teacher for having &ldquo;spurred my interest in science during my senior year of high school and urged me to pursue a B.S. in chemistry while attending Radford University.&rdquo; She participated in the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Department of Pharmacology Carolina Summer Fellowship Program, and she graduated Magna Cum Laude with a B.S. in chemistry from Radford University, VA. She earned her Ph.D. in pharmacology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.</p>
<p>During postdoctoral studies in the laboratory of Dr. Christopher Counter at Duke University, she began investigating the molecular mechanisms by which the aberrant activation of the small GTPase RAS promotes cancer by dissecting the signaling pathways downstream of oncogenic RAS, including the RAL GTPases and the RAF-MEK-ERK cascade.</p>
<p>Among many awards, Brady earned the James Lewis Howe Award for Outstanding Achievement in Chemistry from the American Chemical Society in 2003. She also received the AACR Annual Meeting Minority Scholar in Cancer Research Award two years in a row in 2013 and 2014. Brady is a member of the American Association for Cancer Research, the American Chemical Society, and the International Biometals Society.</p>

<p>The Cancer Registry course hosted representation from twelve countries in the region, including: Afghanistan; Algeria; Azerbaijan; Cyprus; Egypt; Georgia; Israel; Jordan; Lebanon, Morocco; Sudan; Turkey; United Arab Emirates; and Uzbekistan. Participants had the opportunity to brainstorm on utilization of registry data for primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention activities. &nbsp;As the activities of the Izmir hub expand, countries will be able to receive technical assistance and support in their individual registry activities from ICR and IARC, as well as seek collaboration in research studies.</p>
<p>The CGH continues to facilitate and support the development of cancer registries and cancer control research across all nations. &nbsp;The synergy between these two areas, as exemplified through training courses like <i>The Uses of Cancer Registry Data in Cancer Control Research</i>, allow for us to further engage with our partner countries and institutions to strengthen cancer control efforts worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
