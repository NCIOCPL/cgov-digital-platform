## Cgov Digital Platform NCI Design System Theme

This is the www.cancer.gov theme, which is being considered the default theme for NCI DS and CGDP. Any microsites could inherit from this theme, but provide their own front-end build. The biggest challenge is that Drupal does not support inheriting complex CSS/JS build processes from base themes. (Since all the front-end building is outside of Drupal's hands - so we are only left with local file system references for "inheritance")
